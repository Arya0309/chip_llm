The provided code is **not synthesizable** for the following reasons:

1. **Disallowed header** – `#include <iostream>` introduces I/O facilities, which are prohibited in synthesizable code.
2. **Data‑dependent loop bounds** – The loops over `epochs`, `n`, and `d` use function parameters as bounds. Since these values are not known at compile time, the synthesis tool cannot guarantee a finite number of iterations, violating the bounded‑loop requirement.
3. **Use of `using namespace std;`** – While not a direct synthesis blocker, it is generally discouraged in hardware‑targeted code and can lead to name clashes.

To make the code synthesizable, we need to:
- Remove all I/O headers and namespace usage.
- Replace data‑dependent bounds with compile‑time constants.  
  We can achieve this by templating the function on the dataset size (`N`), feature dimension (`D`), and number of epochs (`EPOCHS`), or by using fixed‑size arrays if the problem domain is known (e.g., 4×2 matrix and a fixed number of epochs).
- Keep the algorithmic logic unchanged.

Below is a corrected, synthesizable version that uses template parameters for the dataset size, feature dimension, and epoch count. This ensures all loop bounds are known at compile time, satisfying synthesis constraints.
