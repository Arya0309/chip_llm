[Environment] Verifying synthesizability…

[FEEDBACK]
- Inclusion of `<bits/stdc++.h>` brings in I/O streams and many STL containers, which are disallowed for synthesizability.
- The `for` loop iterates from 2 to `n`, where `n` is an input value; this data‑dependent loop has no statically provable upper bound.
- The use of the `std` namespace is permissible, but the inclusion of standard headers that provide I/O and STL facilities violates the rules.
- No recursion or dynamic memory allocation is present, but the above issues are sufficient for a synthesis failure.

No further issues are detected beyond the ones listed.

<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze synthesizability. The code includes <bits/stdc++.h> which is disallowed. Also the loop is data-dependent but bounded by n<1000, but synthesizer requires statically provable upper bound. We could replace loop with a fixed maximum of 1000? But we can also use a compile-time constant maximum. But n is input, so loop bound is unknown at compile time. However, synthesizable code typically requires loops with statically known bounds. We can unroll or use a fixed maximum. Since n<1000, we could set a constant MAX_N=1000 and loop from 2 to MAX_N but break when i>n. That still has data-dependent break. But we can use a for loop with fixed bound and compute only up to n. But synthesizer may not allow break. Alternative: use a while loop with counter <= n but n is input. Might still be disallowed. We can use a simple recursive function? Recursion is disallowed. We can use a lookup table of Fibonacci numbers up to 1000 precomputed at compile time. That would be synthesizable: compute at compile time using constexpr array. Then fib function returns table[n]. That avoids loops. That is synthesizable. So we need to provide corrected code: remove bits/stdc++.h, use <cstdint> maybe, but no I/O. We need to keep function fib. Provide constexpr array of size 1001. Use std::array or static const int arr[1001] = {...}. But we need to compute at compile time. We can use constexpr function to fill array. But C++17 constexpr can fill array. Use std::array<int, 1001> fib_table = []{ std::array<int, 1001> a{}; a[0]=0; a[1]=1; for(int i=2;i<=1000;i++) a[i]=a[i-1]+a[i-2]; return a; }(); Then fib returns fib_table[n]. That is synthesizable. Also no I/O. Provide code. Ensure no <bits/stdc++.h>. Use <array>. Provide using namespace std; allowed. Provide function fib.

Thus final code.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>[ANALYSIS]
The original code is not synthesizable for the following reasons:

1. **Forbidden header** – `<bits/stdc++.h>` pulls in many standard library facilities (I/O streams, containers, etc.) that are disallowed in synthesizable code.
2. **Data‑dependent loop bound** – the `for` loop iterates from `2` to `n`, where `n` is an input value. Synthesizers require loop bounds to be known at compile time; a runtime‑dependent bound is not allowed.
3. **No static upper bound** – even though the problem statement guarantees `n < 1000`, the compiler cannot prove this at synthesis time, so the loop remains disallowed.

To make the code synthesizable we can pre‑compute the Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum possible input (`1000`) at compile time and store them in a constant array. The `fib` function then simply indexes into this array, eliminating any runtime loops or dynamic memory usage.

The corrected code below satisfies all synthesizability constraints:
- Uses only `<array>` from the standard library (which is allowed).
- No runtime loops or dynamic memory allocation.
- No I/O or other disallowed facilities.

```cpp
/* === IO REQUIREMENT (HINT) ===
Expected input consists of:
   a number n, where n<1000
Expected output consists of:
    a number
*/
#include <array>
using namespace std;

constexpr std::array<int, 1001> build_fib_table() {
    std::array<int, 1001> a{};
    a[0] = 0;
    a[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= 1000; ++i) {
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + a[i - 2];
    }
    return a;
}

constexpr std::array<int, 1001> fib_table = build_fib_table();

int fib(int n) {
    return fib_table[n];
}
```
