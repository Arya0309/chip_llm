<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze if the code can be synthesized by Cadence Stratus HLS. The feedback says inclusion of <iostream> and using namespace std is not synthesizable. So we need to remove that. Also, we need to ensure no dynamic memory, no std library usage. The code uses only arrays and loops, which is fine. The function signature uses const float arrays, which is okay. The code uses a ternary operator for ReLU, which is synthesizable. The loops are simple. So the only issue is the inclusion of iostream and using namespace std. So we need to remove them. Also maybe we need to add static or const qualifiers? But it's fine.

Also we might need to add #pragma HLS interface or something? But the requirement is just to produce synthesizable code. The code uses arrays of fixed size, which is fine. The function signature is fine. So we can just remove the header and using namespace. Also maybe we should use #pragma HLS array_partition or something? But not necessary.

Thus the corrected code: remove #include <iostream> and using namespace std. Also maybe we need to add #pragma HLS interface to specify ports? But not required. The code is synthesizable.

Thus we output the corrected code.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>[ANALYSIS]
The original code contains a non‑synthesizable header `<iostream>` and the directive `using namespace std;`. These introduce I/O facilities that are not supported by Cadence Stratus HLS.  
All other constructs—fixed‑size arrays, simple loops, arithmetic operations, and a ternary operator for ReLU—are synthesizable.  
Therefore, the only blocking issue is the inclusion of the I/O header and namespace usage. Removing them yields a fully synthesizable implementation.
