[Environment] Verifying synthesizability…

[FEEDBACK]
- The code includes `<iostream>`, which is an I/O library and disallowed for synthesizable designs.
- The loops over `width` and `height` are data‑dependent and not bounded by compile‑time constants, violating the requirement for statically provable finite loop bounds.
- No other synthesizability violations are present, but the above two issues are sufficient to fail the check.

<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze synthesizability. The code includes <iostream> which is disallowed. Also loops over width and height are data-dependent, not compile-time constants. The requirement is that loops must be bounded by compile-time constants. The function gaussianBlur takes width and height as parameters. That is not synthesizable. Also includes iostream. So not synthesizable. We need to correct: remove iostream, use fixed size 64x64. Use static arrays or pointers but width and height should be constants. We can define constants 64. The loops should be bounded by 64. Also need to avoid dynamic memory. The kernel is static constant. That is fine. So we produce corrected code: remove iostream, use constexpr int width=64, height=64. The function signature can be void gaussianBlur(const float* input, float* output). Or we can keep width and height but they must be compile-time constants. But we can use template parameters. For simplicity, we can define constexpr int width=64, height=64. Then loops use those. Also we need to avoid dynamic memory. The code uses static const int kernel[5][5] which is fine. So final code:

#include <cstddef> maybe not needed. But we can include nothing. Use namespace std? Not needed. Provide code.

We should also mention that we removed iostream and made width/height compile-time constants.

We need to output analysis block with reasoning and list blocking issues. Then corrected code.

Let's produce.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>[ANALYSIS]
The provided code is **not synthesizable** for the following reasons:

1. **Disallowed I/O library** – The inclusion of `<iostream>` introduces non‑synthesizable I/O functionality.  
2. **Data‑dependent loop bounds** – The outer loops iterate over `width` and `height`, which are passed as runtime parameters. Synthesizable designs require loop bounds to be known at compile time (statically provable finite bounds).  
3. **Missing compile‑time constants** – The function signature does not enforce fixed image dimensions, so the synthesis tool cannot guarantee boundedness.

To make the code synthesizable we must:

- Remove all non‑synthesizable headers (e.g., `<iostream>`).  
- Replace runtime parameters `width` and `height` with compile‑time constants (e.g., `constexpr int WIDTH = 64; constexpr int HEIGHT = 64;`).  
- Keep the kernel and factor as static constants.  
- Ensure all loops use these compile‑time constants.

Below is a corrected, synthesizable version of the Gaussian blur routine.
