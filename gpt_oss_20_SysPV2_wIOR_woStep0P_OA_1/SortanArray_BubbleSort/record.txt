[FEEDBACK]
- The function `bubbleSort` contains loops whose bounds depend on the runtime value `n`. Since `n` is a function parameter, the compiler cannot statically prove that the loops are bounded, violating the synthesizability rule regarding data‑dependent loop bounds.  
- No other violations (I/O, recursion, dynamic memory, STL, pointers, undefined behavior) are present.

<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze synthesizability. The code uses loops with bounds depending on runtime variable n. The feedback says loops bounds depend on runtime value n, violating synthesizability rule regarding data-dependent loop bounds. So code is not synthesizable as is. We need to correct it: we can replace n with a constant known at compile time, e.g., 6. Since the IO requirement says array of 6 elements. So we can change bubbleSort to use fixed size array of 6. Or we can use a macro or template to enforce compile-time size. Since we need synthesizable code, we can use a constant size. So modify bubbleSort signature to void bubbleSort(int arr[6]) or int arr[], but we need to know n=6. We can pass n as constant 6. But loops still use n variable. We can replace n with 6 directly. Or we can use a template parameter. Let's produce corrected code: bubbleSort takes int arr[6] and loops i<5, j<5-i. Use constant 6. Also remove dynamic memory, recursion, etc. It's fine. Provide code. Also we need to keep swap function. Provide final code.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>[ANALYSIS]
The original `bubbleSort` function uses loop bounds that depend on the runtime parameter `n`. Synthesizers require loop bounds to be known at compile time, so this code is **not** synthesizable.  
To make it synthesizable we replace the data‑dependent bounds with fixed constants, matching the IO requirement of a 6‑element array. The corrected version uses the constant `6` directly in the loop limits and removes the `n` parameter.

[OpenAI-Verifier] result:

[FEEDBACK]
• The code includes the header `<stdio.h>`, which is typically used for I/O operations. However, no I/O functions (like printf or scanf) are actually used in the code, so this does not constitute a violation.
• The function `swap` uses pointers, but they are used in a controlled manner to access elements of a fixed-size array, which is acceptable.
• The `bubbleSort` function operates on a fixed-size array of 6 elements, and the loops have statically provable finite bounds, ensuring bounded execution.
• No recursion, dynamic memory allocation, STL containers, or undefined behavior patterns are present in the code.
• No violations found.
