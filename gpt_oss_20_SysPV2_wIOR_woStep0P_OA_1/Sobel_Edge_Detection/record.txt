[Environment] Verifying synthesizability…

[FEEDBACK]
- The code includes `<iostream>`, which introduces I/O operations that are not synthesizable in Cadence Stratus HLS.
- The outer loops iterate from `0` to `width-1` and `0` to `height-1`, and the inner loops iterate from `1` to `width-2` and `1` to `height-2`. Since `width` and `height` are function parameters and not compile‑time constants, these loops are data‑dependent and cannot be proven to have a fixed upper bound at synthesis time.

[Actor] Generating report…

<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze if the code can be synthesized by Cadence Stratus HLS. The feedback says: includes <iostream> not synthesizable. Also loops with width and height parameters not compile-time constants cause data-dependent loops. We need to modify code to be synthesizable. We need to produce analysis block with reasoning, then output either original code if synthesizable, else corrected code. Since code is not synthesizable due to I/O and dynamic loops, we need to provide corrected version.

We need to remove <iostream>, use only arrays. Also loops must have static bounds. Since width and height are 64x64 matrix, we can set constants. We can use template parameters or #define. We can use const int WIDTH = 64, HEIGHT = 64. Then loops from 0 to WIDTH-1 etc. Also we need to avoid dynamic memory. Use static arrays. Also we need to avoid abs function? abs is fine. But we need to include <cmath> or use std::abs. But we can use inline function.

Also we need to ensure that the function signature uses pointer to unsigned char arrays of size WIDTH*HEIGHT. We can keep width and height parameters but they must be compile-time constants? In HLS, loops must have static bounds; if width and height are parameters, loops cannot be unrolled. We can use #pragma HLS loop_tripcount or use constant. But better to use template parameters.

Thus produce corrected code:

```
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib> // for abs
// no iostream

const int WIDTH = 64;
const int HEIGHT = 64;

void sobelEdgeDetection(const uint8_t* input, uint8_t* output)
{
    int Gx[3][3] = { {-1,0,1}, {-2,0,2}, {-1,0,1} };
    int Gy[3][3] = { {-1,-2,-1}, {0,0,0}, {1,2,1} };

    // zero borders
    for (int x=0; x<WIDTH; ++x) {
        output[x] = 0;
        output[(HEIGHT-1)*WIDTH + x] = 0;
    }
    for (int y=0; y<HEIGHT; ++y) {
        output[y*WIDTH] = 0;
        output[y*WIDTH + (WIDTH-1)] = 0;
    }

    for (int y=1; y<HEIGHT-1; ++y) {
        for (int x=1; x<WIDTH-1; ++x) {
            int sumX=0, sumY=0;
            for (int ky=-1; ky<=1; ++ky) {
                for (int kx=-1; kx<=1; ++kx) {
                    int pixel = input[(y+ky)*WIDTH + (x+kx)];
                    sumX += Gx[ky+1][kx+1] * pixel;
                    sumY += Gy[ky+1][kx+1] * pixel;
                }
            }
            int magnitude = std::abs(sumX) + std::abs(sumY);
            if (magnitude > 255) magnitude = 255;
            output[y*WIDTH + x] = static_cast<uint8_t>(magnitude);
        }
    }
}
```

Also we can add #pragma HLS pipeline or unroll loops. But not necessary.

Thus we output analysis block, then corrected code.

We must not output anything else.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>[ANALYSIS]
The original code cannot be synthesized by Cadence Stratus HLS for the following reasons:

1. **I/O Header** – The inclusion of `<iostream>` introduces standard C++ I/O streams, which are not synthesizable. Stratus HLS requires a pure algorithmic implementation without any runtime I/O.

2. **Data‑dependent Loop Bounds** – The outer loops iterate up to `width` and `height`, which are function parameters. Stratus HLS requires loop trip counts to be known at compile time to generate hardware. Since `width` and `height` are not compile‑time constants, the tool cannot determine the number of iterations, leading to synthesis failure.

3. **Dynamic Memory Access** – Although the code uses pointer arithmetic, the loop bounds being dynamic still prevent the tool from inferring a fixed hardware structure.

To make the design synthesizable:

- Remove all non‑synthesizable headers (`<iostream>`).
- Replace the dynamic `width` and `height` parameters with compile‑time constants (e.g., `WIDTH = 64`, `HEIGHT = 64`).
- Keep the algorithmic logic identical, but ensure all loops have static bounds.
- Use standard integer types (`uint8_t`) and include only headers that are synthesizable (`<cstdint>`, `<cstdlib>` for `abs`).

The corrected version below satisfies these constraints and should synthesize successfully in Cadence Stratus HLS.
