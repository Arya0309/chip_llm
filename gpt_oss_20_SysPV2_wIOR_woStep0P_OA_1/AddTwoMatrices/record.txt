[Environment] Verifying synthesizability…

[FEEDBACK]
- The code includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is a non-standard header and disallowed for synthesizability checks.  
- No other violations (I/O, recursion, dynamic memory, unbounded loops, STL containers, pointer misuse, or undefined behavior) are present.  
- Because the presence of `<bits/stdc++.h>` is a synthesizability violation, the design cannot be guaranteed to synthesize.

<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze whether the code can be synthesized. The code includes <bits/stdc++.h> which is non-standard and disallowed. Also uses std namespace, but that's fine. The code uses arrays, loops, no recursion, no dynamic memory, no STL containers. The only violation is the header. So we need to correct it by replacing <bits/stdc++.h> with <iostream> maybe, but the code doesn't use I/O. But we might need to include <cstddef> or nothing. Since no I/O, we can just remove include. But we might need to include <iostream> for potential I/O. But the code doesn't use any I/O. We can just remove the include. But the code uses std::? Actually uses std::? No, only using namespace std; but no std usage. So we can remove include entirely. But we might need to keep header for array definitions? No, arrays are built-in. So we can just remove the include. So synthesizable version: no includes. Or include <cstddef> for size_t? Not needed. So we produce code with no includes. Also we might need to add function prototypes? Not necessary.

Thus we output analysis block listing the issue: non-standard header. Then corrected code.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>[ANALYSIS]
The code fails synthesizability due to the inclusion of the non‑standard header `<bits/stdc++.h>`.  
All other aspects (array usage, loops, no recursion, no dynamic memory, no STL containers, no pointer misuse, no undefined behavior) are acceptable for synthesis.  
To make the code synthesizable, replace the non‑standard header with no header (or a standard one if I/O were required).  
The corrected code below removes the problematic include and retains the functional logic.
