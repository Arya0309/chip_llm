    "**System Functionality:**\n",
    "The provided C++ code defines a simple system to add two complex numbers. The system includes a `Complex` class with methods to set the values of complex numbers and a static method to add two complex numbers. The primary functionality involves setting up two complex numbers, performing addition, and storing the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Hardware Modules:**\n",
    "- **Complex Number Storage Module:** Stores the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers. This can be implemented using registers or memory elements.\n",
    "- **Addition Module:** Performs the addition of the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers. This module can be realized using combinational logic.\n",
    "- **Control Module:** Manages the sequence of operations, ensuring that the addition operation occurs only after the complex numbers have been set. This can be implemented using a simple finite state machine (FSM).\n",

    "- The **Control Module** initializes the **Complex Number Storage Module** with the values of the complex numbers.\n",
