{"version_1":"You will receive C++/C code as input. 

**Tasks**:
1. Read and thoroughly analyze the provided C++/C code.
2. Identify the input(s) and output(s) of the code.
3. Provide a detailed, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language summary that explains:
   - The inputs and outputs of the code.
   - Each major line or block of code and its functionality (e.g., declarations, loops, conditions, data transformations).
4. Finally, based on your analysis, generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet 
   that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.

**C++/C Code**:
```
{CODE}
```

**Instructions**:
- Your answer must explicitly list the inputs and outputs.
- Your answer must include a clear, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language explanation.
- After the summary, generate SystemC code that reflects the same behavior.
- Provide the SystemC code in a compilable snippet, for example:

```
#include <systemc.h>
// ...
// <systemC code here>
// ...
```

Ensure that the SystemC code you provide faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source.
Make the explanation thorough and accessible."},
