### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Failed Test Cases and Failure Symptoms**:
   - The error messages indicate that the `SelectionSort` module does not have methods named `load_array` and `read_array`. This suggests that the testbench is trying to call these non-existent methods on the `SelectionSort` instance.

2. **Locate the Part of the Generated Code Causing the Error**:
   - The error occurs in the `Testbench::run_tests()` method, where `selection_sort_inst->load_array(arr_in)` and `selection_sort_inst->read_array(arr_out)` are called.

3. **Explain Why That Section is Incorrect or Insufficient**:
   - The `SelectionSort` module does not have the `load_array` and `read_array` methods. These methods are not defined in the provided SystemC code, and the testbench expects them to be present.

4. **Propose Concrete Changes to Fix the Issue**:
   - To fix this issue, we need to define the `load_array` and `read_array` methods in the `SelectionSort` module. These methods should allow the testbench to load an array into the module and read the sorted array back.

5. **Provide the Revised Version of the Code Snippet**:
   - We will add the `load_array` and `read_array` methods to the `SelectionSort` module. Additionally, we will ensure that the sorting process is triggered by the `start` signal and completed by the `done` signal.

6. **Finally, Regenerate and Provide the Complete, Fixed SystemC Module Code**:

Here is the revised SystemC code snippet:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SelectionSort) {
    sc_in<bool> clk;      // Clock signal
    sc_in<bool> start;    // Start signal
    sc_out<bool> done;   // Done signal

    int arr[5];           // Array to store the elements
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    int i, j, min_idx;

    SC_CTOR(SelectionSort) {
        SC_METHOD(sort_process);
        sensitive << clk.pos();
    }

    // Method to load an array into the module
    void load_array(int* arr_in) {
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = arr_in[i];
        }
    }

    // Method to read the sorted array from the module
    void read_array(int* arr_out) {
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr_out[i] = arr[i];
        }
    }

    // Method to perform the sorting process
    void sort_process() {
        if (start.read()) {
            for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
                min_idx = i;
                for (j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
                    if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) {
                        min_idx = j;
                    }
                }
                swap(&arr[min_idx], &arr[i]);
            }
            done.write(true);
        } else {
            done.write(false);
        }
    }

    // Swap function
    void swap(int *xp, int *yp) {
        int temp = *xp;
        *xp = *yp;
        *yp = temp;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Added `load_array` Method**: This method takes an array pointer as input and copies the elements into the `arr` array within the `SelectionSort` module.
- **Added `read_array` Method**: This method takes an array pointer as output and copies the sorted elements from the `arr` array into the output array.
- **Updated `sort_process` Method**: This method now uses the `arr` array instead of a hardcoded array. It also ensures that the sorting process is triggered by the `start` signal and completed by the `done` signal.

This revised code should now correctly integrate with the testbench and pass the unit tests.
