### C++/C Code Analysis

**Inputs**:
- `P`: Principal amount (float)
- `R`: Rate of interest (float)
- `T`: Time (float)

**Outputs**:
- `SI`: Simple Interest (float)

**Explanation**:
1. **Line 7**: The program includes the `<iostream>` header to use input/output operations.
2. **Line 8**: The `using namespace std;` directive is used to avoid prefixing standard library names with `std::`.
3. **Line 10**: The `main` function is declared, which serves as the entry point of the program.
4. **Lines 13-15**: Three float variables `P`, `R`, and `T` are declared and initialized to 1. These represent the principal amount, rate of interest, and time respectively.
5. **Line 18**: A float variable `SI` is declared to store the calculated simple interest.
6. **Line 20**: The simple interest is calculated using the formula `(P * T * R) / 100` and stored in `SI`.
7. **Line 22**: The calculated simple interest is printed to the console using `cout`.
8. **Line 24**: The `main` function returns 0, indicating successful execution.

### SystemC Code Generation

To create a SystemC equivalent that integrates with the provided signals (`P`, `R`, `T`, `SI`), we need to define a module with these signals as ports. The module will calculate the simple interest and assign it to the `SI` output signal.

Here is the equivalent SystemC code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SimpleInterestCalculator) {
    sc_in<float> P;  // Input port for the principal amount
    sc_in<float> R;  // Input port for the rate of interest
    sc_in<float> T;  // Input port for the time
    sc_out<float> SI; // Output port for the simple interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SimpleInterestCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate simple interest
        SC_METHOD(calculate_simple_interest);
        sensitive << P << R << T;
    }

    // Method to calculate simple interest
    void calculate_simple_interest() {
        float si = (P.read() * T.read() * R.read()) / 100;
        SI.write(si);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **Line 7**: The SystemC header `<systemc.h>` is included.
2. **Line 9**: A SystemC module named `SimpleInterestCalculator` is defined.
3. **Lines 10-12**: The input signals `P`, `R`, and `T` are declared as `sc_in<float>` types.
4. **Line 13**: The output signal `SI` is declared as `sc_out<float>` type.
5. **Lines 15-17**: The constructor of the module is defined. It sets up a method `calculate_simple_interest` to be triggered whenever any of the input signals change.
6. **Lines 19-23**: The `calculate_simple_interest` method reads the values of `P`, `R`, and `T`, calculates the simple interest using the formula `(P * T * R) / 100`, and writes the result to the `SI` output signal.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C program and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow with the provided signals.
