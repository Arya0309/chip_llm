### Input and Output Summary

**Inputs:**
1. `principal` (double): The initial amount of money.
2. `rate` (double): The annual interest rate (in percentage).
3. `time` (double): The time the money is invested or borrowed for (in years).

**Outputs:**
1. `ci` (double): The calculated compound interest.

### Detailed Explanation

The provided C++ code calculates the compound interest for a given principal amount, interest rate, and time period. Here’s a line-by-line breakdown of the code:

1. **Include Headers:**
   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   ```
   This line includes the standard C++ library, which provides access to various functions and classes.

2. **Namespace Declaration:**
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   This line sets the standard namespace so that we don’t need to prefix standard library names with `std::`.

3. **Main Function:**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
   ```
   The `main` function is the entry point of the program.

4. **Variable Declarations:**
   ```cpp
   double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;
   ```
   These lines declare and initialize the variables `principal`, `rate`, and `time` with the given values.

5. **Calculate Compound Interest:**
   ```cpp
   double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));
   double CI = A - principal;
   ```
   - `A` is calculated using the formula for compound interest: \( A = P \times (1 + \frac{r}{100})^t \), where \( P \) is the principal, \( r \) is the rate, and \( t \) is the time.
   - `CI` (Compound Interest) is then calculated as \( CI = A - P \).

6. **Output the Result:**
   ```cpp
   cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;
   ```
   This line prints the calculated compound interest to the console.

7. **Return Statement:**
   ```cpp
   return 0;
   ```
   The `main` function returns 0, indicating successful execution.

### SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals and maintains the same logic:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
    sc_in<double> principal;  // Input port for the principal amount
    sc_in<double> rate;       // Input port for the interest rate
    sc_in<double> time;       // Input port for the time period
    sc_out<double> ci;        // Output port for the compound interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate compound interest
        SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculate_ci() {
        double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
        double CI = A - principal.read();
        ci.write(CI);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration:**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
   ```
   This line declares a SystemC module named `CompoundInterestCalculator`.

2. **Input and Output Ports:**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<double> principal;
   sc_in<double> rate;
   sc_in<double> time;
   sc_out<double> ci;
   ```
   These lines define the input and output ports that correspond to the inputs and outputs of the original C++ code.

3. **Constructor:**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
       SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
       sensitive << principal << rate << time;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the module and specifies that the `calculate_ci` method should be called whenever `principal`, `rate`, or `time` changes.

4. **Method to Calculate Compound Interest:**
   ```cpp
   void calculate_ci() {
       double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
       double CI = A - principal.read();
       ci.write(CI);
   }
   ```
   - This method reads the values from the input ports, calculates the compound interest using the same formula, and writes the result to the output port `ci`.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.
