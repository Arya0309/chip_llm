### Analysis of the C++ Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: None (The code is self-contained and does not take external inputs)
- **Outputs**: 
  - The real and imaginary parts of the sum of two complex numbers.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Header Inclusion**
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the standard C++ library and uses the standard namespace for convenience.

2. **Complex Class Definition**
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - A `Complex` class is defined with public members `real` and `imaginary`.
   - A constructor initializes these members with default values if none are provided.
   - The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects as arguments, adds their real and imaginary parts, and returns a new `Complex` object representing the sum.

3. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` are created with specified real and imaginary parts.
   - The real and imaginary parts of `C1` and `C2` are printed.
   - A third `Complex` object `C3` is created and initialized with the sum of `C1` and `C2` using the `addComp` method.
   - The real and imaginary parts of `C3` are printed.

### SystemC Code Snippet

To integrate this logic into a SystemC environment, we need to create a module that takes two complex numbers as inputs and produces their sum as outputs. We will use the provided signals `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, `real_sum`, and `imag_sum`.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        int sum_real = real1.read() + real2.read();
        int sum_imag = imag1.read() + imag2.read();
        real_sum.write(sum_real);
        imag_sum.write(sum_imag);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
   ```
   - Defines a SystemC module named `ComplexAdder`.

2. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> real1;
   sc_in<int> imag1;
   sc_in<int> real2;
   sc_in<int> imag2;
   sc_out<int> real_sum;
   sc_out<int> imag_sum;
   ```
   - Declares input ports `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2` to receive the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
   - Declares output ports `real_sum` and `imag_sum` to send the real and imaginary parts of the sum.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
       SC_METHOD(add);
       sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
   }
   ```
   - Initializes the module with a method `add` that will be triggered whenever any of the input ports change.

4. **Addition Method**
   ```cpp
   void add() {
       int sum_real = real1.read() + real2.read();
       int sum_imag = imag1.read() + imag2.read();
       real_sum.write(sum_real);
       imag_sum.write(sum_imag);
   }
   ```
   - Reads the real and imaginary parts from the input ports.
   - Computes the sum of the real and imaginary parts.
   - Writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code snippet faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
