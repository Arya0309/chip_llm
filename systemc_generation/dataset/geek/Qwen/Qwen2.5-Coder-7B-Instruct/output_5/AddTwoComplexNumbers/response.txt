### Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs**:
- `real1`: Real part of the first complex number.
- `imag1`: Imaginary part of the first complex number.
- `real2`: Real part of the second complex number.
- `imag2`: Imaginary part of the second complex number.

**Outputs**:
- `real_sum`: Real part of the sum of the two complex numbers.
- `imag_sum`: Imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers.

### Detailed Explanation

#### 1. Class Definition
The program defines a `Complex` class to represent complex numbers. The class has two public members:
- `real`: Represents the real part of the complex number.
- `imaginary`: Represents the imaginary part of the complex number.

#### 2. Constructor
The constructor initializes the `real` and `imaginary` parts of the complex number:
```cpp
Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0) {
    real = tempReal;
    imaginary = tempImaginary;
}
```

#### 3. Addition Method
The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects as parameters and returns a new `Complex` object representing their sum:
```cpp
Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2) {
    Complex temp;
    temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
    temp.imaginary = C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary;
    return temp;
}
```

#### 4. Main Function
The `main` function creates two `Complex` objects (`C1` and `C2`) and prints them. It then calls the `addComp` method to calculate the sum and prints the result:
```cpp
int main() {
    Complex C1(3, 2);
    cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;

    Complex C2(9, 5);
    cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;

    Complex C3;
    C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
    cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
}
```

### SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that integrates with the provided signals:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**:
   - The `ComplexAdder` module is declared with four input ports (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`) and two output ports (`real_sum`, `imag_sum`).

2. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor initializes the `add` method to be sensitive to changes in any of the input ports.

3. **Addition Method**:
   - The `add` method reads the values from the input ports, calculates the real and imaginary parts of the sum, and writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code snippet faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
