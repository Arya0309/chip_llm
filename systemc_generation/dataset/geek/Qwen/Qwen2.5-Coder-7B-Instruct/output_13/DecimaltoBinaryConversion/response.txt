### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Input**: An integer `n` which is the decimal number to be converted to binary.
- **Output**: The binary representation of the input decimal number is printed to the console.

#### Detailed Explanation of the Code

1. **Include Statements and Namespace**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the input-output stream library and sets the standard namespace to `std`.

2. **Function Declaration**
   ```cpp
   void decToBinary(int n)
   ```
   - This function takes an integer `n` as input and converts it to binary.

3. **Array to Store Binary Number**
   ```cpp
   int binaryNum[32];
   ```
   - An array `binaryNum` of size 32 is declared to store the binary digits.

4. **Counter for Binary Array**
   ```cpp
   int i = 0;
   ```
   - A counter `i` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the current position in the `binaryNum` array.

5. **While Loop to Convert Decimal to Binary**
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
       n = n / 2;
       i++;
   }
   ```
   - This loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - Inside the loop, the remainder of `n` divided by 2 (`n % 2`) is stored in `binaryNum[i]`, effectively capturing the binary digits.
   - `n` is then updated to `n / 2` to process the next bit.
   - The counter `i` is incremented to move to the next position in the array.

6. **For Loop to Print Binary Array in Reverse Order**
   ```cpp
   for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
       cout << binaryNum[j];
   ```
   - This loop starts from the last filled position `i-1` and prints each binary digit in reverse order.

7. **Driver Code**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int n = 10;
       decToBinary(n);
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function initializes `n` to 10 and calls the `decToBinary` function to convert and print the binary representation of 10.

### Generated SystemC Code Snippet

Here's the equivalent SystemC code that utilizes the provided signals `dec_in` and `binary_out`:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinaryConverter) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for the binary representation

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinaryConverter) {
        // Process to convert decimal to binary
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    // Method to convert decimal to binary and output it
    void convert() {
        int n = dec_in.read();
        int binaryNum[32];
        int i = 0;

        // Convert decimal to binary
        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }

        // Construct the binary number as an integer
        int binary = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            binary = (binary << 1) | binaryNum[j];
        }

        // Write the binary number to the output port
        binary_out.write(binary);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(BinaryConverter) {
   ```
   - A SystemC module named `BinaryConverter` is declared.

2. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> dec_in;
   sc_out<int> binary_out;
   ```
   - Two ports are declared: `dec_in` for the input decimal number and `binary_out` for the output binary representation.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(BinaryConverter) {
       SC_METHOD(convert);
       sensitive << dec_in;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the `convert` method to be sensitive to changes on `dec_in`.

4. **Convert Method**
   ```cpp
   void convert() {
       int n = dec_in.read();
       int binaryNum[32];
       int i = 0;

       // Convert decimal to binary
       while (n > 0) {
           binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
           n = n / 2;
           i++;
       }

       // Construct the binary number as an integer
       int binary = 0;
       for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
           binary = (binary << 1) | binaryNum[j];
       }

       // Write the binary number to the output port
       binary_out.write(binary);
   }
   ```
   - The `convert` method reads the decimal number from `dec_in`.
   - It then follows the same logic as the original C++ code to convert the decimal number to binary.
   - The binary number is constructed as an integer and written to `binary_out`.

This SystemC code accurately reflects the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
