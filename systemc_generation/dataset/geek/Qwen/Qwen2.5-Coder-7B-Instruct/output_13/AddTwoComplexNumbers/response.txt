### Input and Output Summary

The provided C++/C code is designed to add two complex numbers. The inputs and outputs are as follows:

- **Inputs**:
  - `real1`: Real part of the first complex number.
  - `imag1`: Imaginary part of the first complex number.
  - `real2`: Real part of the second complex number.
  - `imag2`: Imaginary part of the second complex number.

- **Outputs**:
  - `real_sum`: Real part of the sum of the two complex numbers.
  - `imag_sum`: Imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers.

### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   This includes the standard C++ library and uses the standard namespace to avoid prefixing standard library functions with `std::`.

2. **User Defined Complex Class**:
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
   ```
   A class named `Complex` is defined with public member variables `real` and `imaginary`.

3. **Constructor**:
   ```cpp
   Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
   {
       real = tempReal;
       imaginary = tempImaginary;
   }
   ```
   The constructor initializes the `real` and `imaginary` members with the provided values.

4. **Method to Add Two Complex Numbers**:
   ```cpp
   Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
   {
       Complex temp;
       temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
       temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
       return temp;
   }
   ```
   The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects as parameters, adds their real and imaginary parts separately, and returns a new `Complex` object containing the sum.

5. **Driver Code**:
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Creates two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` with specified real and imaginary parts.
   - Prints the details of `C1` and `C2`.
   - Calls `addComp` to get the sum of `C1` and `C2` and stores it in `C3`.
   - Prints the sum.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Define a SystemC module for adding complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    // Input ports for the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers
    sc_in<int> real1;
    sc_in<int> imag1;
    sc_in<int> real2;
    sc_in<int> imag2;

    // Output ports for the real and imaginary parts of the sum
    sc_out<int> real_sum;
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(addComplex);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void addComplex() {
        // Calculate the real part of the sum
        int sum_real = real1.read() + real2.read();
        // Calculate the imaginary part of the sum
        int sum_imag = imag1.read() + imag2.read();
        // Write the results to the output ports
        real_sum.write(sum_real);
        imag_sum.write(sum_imag);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - The module `ComplexAdder` has four input ports (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`) and two output ports (`real_sum`, `imag_sum`).

- **Constructor**:
  - The constructor sets up a process (`SC_METHOD`) named `addComplex` that is sensitive to changes on the input ports.

- **Method to Add Complex Numbers**:
  - The `addComplex` method reads the values from the input ports, calculates the real and imaginary parts of the sum, and writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C program and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
