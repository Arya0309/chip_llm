### Analysis of the C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The code takes a single integer `n` as input, which is hardcoded to `153`.
- **Outputs**: The code outputs whether the given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

#### Detailed Explanation
1. **Variable Declarations**:
   ```cpp
   int n = 153;
   int temp = n;
   int p = 0;
   ```
   - `n` is initialized to `153`, which is the input number.
   - `temp` is assigned the value of `n` to preserve the original number for comparison later.
   - `p` is initialized to `0` and will be used to store the sum of the cubes of the digits.

2. **Loop to Calculate Sum of Cubes**:
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       int rem = n % 10;
       p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
       n = n / 10;
   }
   ```
   - The loop runs as long as `n` is greater than `0`.
   - Inside the loop, `rem` is calculated as the remainder when `n` is divided by `10` (i.e., the last digit of `n`).
   - `p` is updated by adding the cube of `rem` to it.
   - `n` is then updated by removing the last digit (i.e., `n = n / 10`).

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   ```cpp
   if (temp == p) {
       cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
   } else {
       cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
   }
   ```
   - After the loop, `temp` (the original number) is compared with `p` (the sum of the cubes of the digits).
   - If they are equal, the program prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No.".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No.".

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that captures the same logic:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong;  // Output port indicating if the number is an Armstrong number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        // Process to check if the number is an Armstrong number
        SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is an Armstrong number
    void check_armstrong() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;
        int count = 0;

        // Count the number of digits
        int temp_n = n;
        while (temp_n > 0) {
            count++;
            temp_n = temp_n / 10;
        }

        // Calculate the sum of the cubes of the digits
        temp_n = n;
        while (temp_n > 0) {
            int rem = temp_n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            temp_n = temp_n / 10;
        }

        // Check if the number is an Armstrong number
        if (temp == p) {
            is_armstrong.write(true);
        } else {
            is_armstrong.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code
- **Inputs**: The `num_in` port is used to input the number to be checked.
- **Outputs**: The `is_armstrong` port outputs a boolean value (`true` if the number is an Armstrong number, `false` otherwise).
- **Logic**:
  - The number of digits in the input number is counted.
  - The sum of the cubes of the digits is calculated.
  - The input number is compared with the sum of the cubes.
  - The result is written to the `is_armstrong` port.
