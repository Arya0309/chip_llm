### Analysis of the C++ Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: None (The code uses a hardcoded value `2000` for the year.)
- **Outputs**: A boolean indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Include and Namespace Declaration**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the standard input-output stream library and sets the standard namespace to `std`.

2. **Function to Check Leap Year**
   ```cpp
   bool checkYear(int year)
   {
       if (year % 400 == 0) {
           return true;
       }
   
       // not a leap year if divisible by 100
       // but not divisible by 400
       else if (year % 100 == 0) {
           return false;
       }
   
       // leap year if not divisible by 100
       // but divisible by 4
       else if (year % 4 == 0) {
           return true;
       }
   
       // all other years are not leap years
       else {
           return false;
       }
   }
   ```
   - This function takes an integer `year` as input and returns a boolean value.
   - It checks if the year is divisible by 400, which makes it a leap year.
   - If not, it checks if the year is divisible by 100, which would make it a non-leap year unless it's also divisible by 400.
   - If not divisible by 100, it checks if the year is divisible by 4, which makes it a leap year.
   - If none of these conditions are met, it returns `false`, indicating the year is not a leap year.

3. **Driver Code**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int year = 2000;
   
       checkYear(year) ? cout << "Leap Year"
                       : cout << "Not a Leap Year";
   
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - This is the entry point of the program.
   - It declares a variable `year` and assigns it the value `2000`.
   - It calls the `checkYear` function with `year` as the argument.
   - Based on the return value of `checkYear`, it prints "Leap Year" or "Not a Leap Year".

### SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals and preserves the logic:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    sc_in<int> year;  // Input port for the year
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year; // Output port for the leap year status

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
        // Process to check if the year is a leap year
        SC_METHOD(check_leap_year);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    // Method to check if the year is a leap year
    void check_leap_year() {
        if (year.read() % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year.read() % 100 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        } else if (year.read() % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Module Declaration**: 
  - `SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker)` defines a new SystemC module named `LeapYearChecker`.
  
- **Input and Output Ports**:
  - `sc_in<int> year;` is the input port for the year.
  - `sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;` is the output port for the leap year status.

- **Constructor**:
  - `SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker)` initializes the module.
  - `SC_METHOD(check_leap_year);` registers the `check_leap_year` method to be executed whenever the `year` input changes.
  - `sensitive << year;` specifies that the `check_leap_year` method should be called when the `year` input changes.

- **Method to Check Leap Year**:
  - `void check_leap_year()` contains the logic to determine if the year is a leap year.
  - It reads the value from the `year` input port and writes the result to the `is_leap_year` output port based on the same conditions as the original C++ code.

This SystemC code can be integrated into a larger design and used in a high-level synthesis flow, leveraging the provided signals for seamless testbench integration.
