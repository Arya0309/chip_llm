### Analysis of the Provided C++ Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Two complex numbers represented by their real and imaginary parts.
- **Outputs**: The sum of the two complex numbers, also represented by their real and imaginary parts.

#### Detailed Explanation of the Code

1. **Imports and Namespace Declaration**
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes all standard C++ libraries and uses the `std` namespace for convenience.

2. **Class Definition for Complex Numbers**
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - **Class `Complex`**: Represents a complex number with `real` and `imaginary` parts.
   - **Constructor**: Initializes the complex number with default values if not provided.
   - **Method `addComp`**: Adds two complex numbers and returns the result.

3. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - **Variables**: Defines three `Complex` objects (`C1`, `C2`, and `C3`).
   - **Output**: Prints the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers and their sum.

### Generated SystemC Code

The following SystemC code snippet replicates the functionality of the provided C++ code. It uses the signals provided in the instructions:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum; // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum; // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Class `ComplexAdder`**: Represents a module that adds two complex numbers.
- **Input Ports**: `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2` are used to receive the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
- **Output Ports**: `real_sum` and `imag_sum` are used to send the real and imaginary parts of the sum.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the module and binds the `add` method to the input ports.
- **Method `add`**: Adds the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers and writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code is now ready to be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow and tested with the provided signals.
