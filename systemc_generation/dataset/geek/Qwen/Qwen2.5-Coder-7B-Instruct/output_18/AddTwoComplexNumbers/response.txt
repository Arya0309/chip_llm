### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The program does not take any user inputs directly. Instead, it uses hardcoded values for the complex numbers.
- **Outputs**: The program prints the real and imaginary parts of the sum of two complex numbers.

#### Detailed Explanation Line-by-Line

1. **Include Libraries**
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes all standard C++ libraries and sets the standard namespace to `std`.

2. **User Defined Complex Class**
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
   ```
   - A class named `Complex` is defined with public member variables `real` and `imaginary`.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
   ```
   - A constructor initializes the `real` and `imaginary` members with default values of 0 if no arguments are provided.

4. **addComp() Method**
   ```cpp
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           return temp;
       }
   ```
   - This method takes two `Complex` objects as parameters, adds their real and imaginary parts, and returns a new `Complex` object containing the sum.

5. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
   ```
   - The `main` function creates a `Complex` object `C1` with real part 3 and imaginary part 2, and prints it.

6. **Second Complex Number**
   ```cpp
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
   ```
   - Another `Complex` object `C2` with real part 9 and imaginary part 5 is created, and printed.

7. **Storing the Sum**
   ```cpp
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
   ```
   - A third `Complex` object `C3` is created. The `addComp` method is called with `C1` and `C2`, and the result is stored in `C3`.

8. **Printing the Sum**
   ```cpp
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - The sum of the two complex numbers is printed.

### SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates seamlessly with the provided signals:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum; // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum; // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Inputs**: The module `ComplexAdder` has four input ports (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`) which correspond to the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
- **Outputs**: The module has two output ports (`real_sum`, `imag_sum`) which correspond to the real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers.
- **Constructor**: The constructor initializes the module and sets up the sensitivity list to trigger the `add` method whenever any of the input ports change.
- **add() Method**: This method reads the values from the input ports, adds the real parts and the imaginary parts separately, and writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
