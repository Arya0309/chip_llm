### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `mat`: A 2D array of integers representing the matrix.
  - `n`: An integer representing the size of the matrix (number of rows and columns).

- **Outputs**:
  - `principal`: The sum of the elements on the principal diagonal of the matrix.
  - `secondary`: The sum of the elements on the secondary diagonal of the matrix.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Constants and Function Declaration**
   ```cpp
   const int MAX = 100; 
   void printDiagonalSums(int mat[][MAX], int n) 
   ```
   - `MAX` is a constant set to 100, which represents the maximum size of the matrix.
   - `printDiagonalSums` is a function that takes a 2D array `mat` and an integer `n` as inputs.

2. **Initialization of Diagonal Sums**
   ```cpp
   int principal = 0, secondary = 0; 
   ```
   - `principal` and `secondary` are initialized to 0 to store the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively.

3. **Nested Loops to Traverse the Matrix**
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
   { 
       for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)	 
       { 
           // Condition for principal diagonal 
           if (i == j) 
               principal += mat[i][j]; 

           // Condition for secondary diagonal 
           if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) 
               secondary += mat[i][j]; 
       } 
   } 
   ```
   - Two nested loops iterate over each element of the matrix.
   - If the current element is on the principal diagonal (`i == j`), it is added to `principal`.
   - If the current element is on the secondary diagonal (`i + j == n - 1`), it is added to `secondary`.

4. **Output the Results**
   ```cpp
   cout << "Principal Diagonal:" << 
           principal << endl; 
   cout << "Secondary Diagonal:" << 
           secondary << endl; 
   ```
   - The sums of the principal and secondary diagonals are printed to the console.

5. **Driver Code**
   ```cpp
   int main() 
   { 
       int a[][MAX] = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, 
                       {5, 6, 7, 8}, 
                       {1, 2, 3, 4}, 
                       {5, 6, 7, 8}}; 
       printDiagonalSums(a, 4); 
       return 0; 
   } 
   ```
   - A sample 4x4 matrix `a` is defined.
   - The `printDiagonalSums` function is called with the matrix and its size.

### SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSumCalculator) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[MAX][MAX];  // Input port for the matrix
    sc_out<int> principal;        // Output port for the sum of the principal diagonal
    sc_out<int> secondary;        // Output port for the sum of the secondary diagonal

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSumCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate diagonal sums
        SC_METHOD(calculate_diagonals);
        sensitive << matrix;
    }

    // Method to calculate the sums of the diagonals
    void calculate_diagonals() {
        int principal_sum = 0, secondary_sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < MAX; j++) {
                // Condition for principal diagonal 
                if (i == j) {
                    principal_sum += matrix[i][j];
                }
                // Condition for secondary diagonal 
                if ((i + j) == (MAX - 1)) {
                    secondary_sum += matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        principal.write(principal_sum);
        secondary.write(secondary_sum);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(DiagonalSumCalculator) {
   ```
   - `DiagonalSumCalculator` is a SystemC module that calculates the sums of the diagonals of a matrix.

2. **Ports Declaration**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> matrix[MAX][MAX];  
   sc_out<int> principal;        
   sc_out<int> secondary;        
   ```
   - `matrix` is an input port for the matrix.
   - `principal` and `secondary` are output ports for the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(DiagonalSumCalculator) {
       SC_METHOD(calculate_diagonals);
       sensitive << matrix;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor sets up the `calculate_diagonals` method to be sensitive to changes in the `matrix` input.

4. **Method to Calculate Diagonals**
   ```cpp
   void calculate_diagonals() {
       int principal_sum = 0, secondary_sum = 0;
       for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
           for (int j = 0; j < MAX; j++) {
               if (i == j) {
                   principal_sum += matrix[i][j];
               }
               if ((i + j) == (MAX - 1)) {
                   secondary_sum += matrix[i][j];
               }
           }
       }
       principal.write(principal_sum);
       secondary.write(secondary_sum);
   }
   ```
   - This method calculates the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals using nested loops.
   - It writes the results to the `principal` and `secondary` output ports.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
