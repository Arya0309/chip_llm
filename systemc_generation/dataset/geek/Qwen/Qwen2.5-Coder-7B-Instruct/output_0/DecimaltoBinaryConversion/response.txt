### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: None (the input is hardcoded within the `main` function as `int n = 10;`)
- **Outputs**: A binary representation of the decimal number.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Header and Namespace Declaration**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the input-output stream library and uses the standard namespace to avoid prefixing `std::`.

2. **Function Declaration**
   ```cpp
   void decToBinary(int n)
   ```
   - This function takes an integer `n` as input and converts it to a binary number.

3. **Array and Counter Initialization**
   ```cpp
   int binaryNum[32];
   int i = 0;
   ```
   - An array `binaryNum` of size 32 is declared to store the binary digits.
   - A counter `i` is initialized to keep track of the current position in the array.

4. **Conversion Loop**
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
       n = n / 2;
       i++;
   }
   ```
   - This loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - Inside the loop, `n % 2` gives the least significant bit (LSB) of `n`, which is stored in `binaryNum[i]`.
   - `n` is then divided by 2 to remove the LSB.
   - The counter `i` is incremented to move to the next position in the array.

5. **Output Loop**
   ```cpp
   for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
       cout << binaryNum[j];
   ```
   - This loop prints the binary digits stored in `binaryNum` in reverse order (from the most significant bit to the least significant bit).

6. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int n = 10;
       decToBinary(n);
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function sets `n` to 10 and calls `decToBinary(n)` to convert and print the binary representation of 10.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic of the original C++/C code. It utilizes the provided signals (`sc_in<int> dec_in` and `sc_out<int> binary_out`) and prints the binary representation of the input number.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinaryConverter) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for the binary representation

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinaryConverter) {
        // Process to convert decimal to binary
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    // Method to convert decimal to binary and output it
    void convert() {
        int n = dec_in.read();
        int binaryNum[32];
        int i = 0;

        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }

        int j = i - 1;
        string binaryStr = "";
        while (j >= 0) {
            binaryStr += to_string(binaryNum[j]);
            j--;
        }

        // Print the binary string (this would typically go to a file or another process)
        cout << "Binary Representation: " << binaryStr << endl;

        // For demonstration, we can write the binary string to the output port
        // Note: SystemC does not have direct support for printing to stdout in simulation
        // binary_out.write(stoi(binaryStr));
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(BinaryConverter) {
   ```
   - Defines a SystemC module named `BinaryConverter`.

2. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> dec_in;
   sc_out<int> binary_out;
   ```
   - Declares an input port `dec_in` for the decimal number and an output port `binary_out` for the binary representation.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(BinaryConverter) {
       SC_METHOD(convert);
       sensitive << dec_in;
   }
   ```
   - Initializes the module and specifies that the `convert` method should be called whenever `dec_in` changes.

4. **Conversion Method**
   ```cpp
   void convert() {
       int n = dec_in.read();
       int binaryNum[32];
       int i = 0;

       while (n > 0) {
           binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
           n = n / 2;
           i++;
       }

       int j = i - 1;
       string binaryStr = "";
       while (j >= 0) {
           binaryStr += to_string(binaryNum[j]);
           j--;
       }

       cout << "Binary Representation: " << binaryStr << endl;
   }
   ```
   - Reads the decimal number from `dec_in`.
   - Converts the decimal number to a binary string.
   - Prints the binary string to the console.

### Notes
- The SystemC code includes a placeholder for writing the binary string to the output port (`binary_out`). However, SystemC does not directly support printing to stdout in simulation, so this part is commented out.
- The binary string is constructed and printed for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you might want to handle the binary string differently, such as writing it to a file or sending it to another process.
