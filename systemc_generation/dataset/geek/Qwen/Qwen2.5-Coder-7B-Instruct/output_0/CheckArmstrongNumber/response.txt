### C++/C Code Analysis

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: None explicitly defined in the code. However, if we consider the hardcoded value `n = 153`, this would be the input for the Armstrong number check.
- **Outputs**: The program prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No." or "No. It is not an Armstrong No." depending on whether the number is an Armstrong number or not.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int n = 153;
   int temp = n;
   int p = 0;
   ```
   - `n` is initialized to the number to be checked (153).
   - `temp` is a copy of `n` to compare later.
   - `p` is initialized to 0 to store the sum of cubes of each digit.

2. **Loop to Calculate Sum of Cubes**:
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       int rem = n % 10;
       p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
       n = n / 10;
   }
   ```
   - This loop runs as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - `rem` stores the last digit of `n`.
   - `p` accumulates the sum of the cubes of the digits (`rem * rem * rem`).
   - `n` is updated by removing the last digit (`n = n / 10`).

3. **Condition to Check Armstrong Number**:
   ```cpp
   if (temp == p) {
       cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
   } else {
       cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
   }
   ```
   - This condition checks if the sum of the cubes (`p`) equals the original number (`temp`).
   - If they are equal, it prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No."
   - Otherwise, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No."

### SystemC Code Generation

Here's the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals and captures the logic of the original C++/C code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong; // Output port indicating if the number is an Armstrong number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        // Process to check if the number is an Armstrong number
        SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is an Armstrong number
    void check_armstrong() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        // Loop to calculate sum of cubes of each digit
        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        // Condition to check whether the value of P equals to user input or not
        if (temp == p) {
            is_armstrong.write(true);
        } else {
            is_armstrong.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `num_in`: The input port that receives the number to be checked.
  - `is_armstrong`: The output port that indicates whether the number is an Armstrong number (`true` if it is, `false` otherwise).

- **Detailed Explanation**:
  - The constructor sets up the `check_armstrong` method to be sensitive to changes on `num_in`.
  - The `check_armstrong` method reads the input number, calculates the sum of the cubes of its digits, and compares it with the original number.
  - Depending on the result, it writes `true` or `false` to the `is_armstrong` output port.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
