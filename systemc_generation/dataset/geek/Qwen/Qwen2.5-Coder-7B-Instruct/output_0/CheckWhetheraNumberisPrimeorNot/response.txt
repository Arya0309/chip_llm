### Analysis of the C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The code does not take any inputs from the user. It uses a hardcoded value `n = 29`.
- **Outputs**: The code prints whether the number `n` is prime or not.

#### Detailed Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int n = 29;
   int cnt = 0;
   ```
   - `n` is set to 29, which is the number to be checked for primality.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to count the number of divisors of `n`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   ```cpp
   if (n <= 1)
       cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;
   ```
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is immediately determined that `n` is not prime and the program outputs "29 is NOT prime".

3. **Loop to Count Divisors**:
   ```cpp
   else {
       for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
           if (n % i == 0)
               cnt++;
       }
   ```
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program enters a loop that runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`). If true, it increments the counter `cnt`.

4. **Final Check for Primality**:
   ```cpp
   if (cnt > 2)
       cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;
   else
       cout << n << " is prime" << endl;
   }
   ```
   - After the loop, the program checks if `cnt` is greater than 2.
   - If `cnt` is greater than 2, it means `n` has more than two divisors, and thus `n` is not prime. The program outputs "29 is NOT prime".
   - If `cnt` is not greater than 2, it means `n` is prime, and the program outputs "29 is prime".

### SystemC Code Snippet

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates the logic of the given C++/C code and utilizes the provided signals `sc_in<int> n` and `sc_out<bool> is_prime`.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n;          // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_prime; // Output port indicating whether the number is prime

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        // Process to determine if the number is prime
        SC_METHOD(check_prime);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is prime
    void check_prime() {
        int cnt = 0;
        bool prime = true;

        if (n.read() <= 1) {
            prime = false;
        } else {
            for (int i = 1; i <= n.read(); i++) {
                if (n.read() % i == 0) {
                    cnt++;
                }
            }
            if (cnt > 2) {
                prime = false;
            }
        }

        is_prime.write(prime);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The `PrimeChecker` module takes an integer `n` as input and outputs a boolean `is_prime` indicating whether `n` is prime.
- **Process**: The `check_prime` method is triggered whenever `n` changes.
- **Logic**:
  - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, `is_prime` is set to `false`.
  - Otherwise, the method counts the number of divisors of `n`. If more than two divisors are found, `is_prime` is set to `false`.
  - Finally, the result (`true` or `false`) is written to the `is_prime` output port.
