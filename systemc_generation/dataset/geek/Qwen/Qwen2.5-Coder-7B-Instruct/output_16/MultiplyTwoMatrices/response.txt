### Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs:**
- Two 2D integer arrays `mat1` and `mat2`.
- The dimensions of these matrices are defined by macros `R1`, `C1`, `R2`, and `C2`.

**Outputs:**
- The product of the two matrices, stored in a new 2D array `rslt`.
- The result is printed to the console.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Declarations
- `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: Includes standard libraries.
- `using namespace std;`: Uses the standard namespace.
- `#define R1 2`, `#define C1 2`, `#define R2 2`, `#define C2 3`: Defines the dimensions of the matrices.
- `int rslt[R1][C2];`: Declares a 2D array to store the result of the multiplication.

#### Function `mulMat`
- Takes two 2D integer arrays `mat1` and `mat2` as input.
- Initializes the result array `rslt` to zero.
- Iterates through each element of `rslt` and calculates the dot product of the corresponding row from `mat1` and column from `mat2`.
- Prints the result matrix to the console.

#### Main Function
- Defines two matrices `mat1` and `mat2` with initial values.
- Checks if the number of columns in `mat1` is equal to the number of rows in `mat2`. If not, it prints an error message and exits.
- Calls the `mulMat` function with `mat1` and `mat2` as arguments.

### SystemC Code Snippet

Below is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that integrates with the provided signals:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixMultiplier) {
    sc_in<int> A[2][2];  // Input port for the first matrix
    sc_in<int> B[2][3];  // Input port for the second matrix
    sc_out<int> C[2][3]; // Output port for the result matrix

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatrixMultiplier) {
        // Process to perform matrix multiplication
        SC_METHOD(mulMat);
        sensitive << A << B;
    }

    // Method to multiply the two matrices
    void mulMat() {
        int rslt[2][3];

        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                rslt[i][j] = 0;

                for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {
                    rslt[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
                }

                C[i][j].write(rslt[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Inputs (`A` and `B`)**: These are 2D input ports representing the two matrices to be multiplied.
- **Outputs (`C`)**: This is a 2D output port representing the resulting matrix after multiplication.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the module and binds the `mulMat` method to the input ports.
- **mulMat Method**: This method performs the matrix multiplication similar to the C++ code. It iterates through each element of the result matrix and calculates the dot product of the corresponding row from `A` and column from `B`. The result is written to the output port `C`.
