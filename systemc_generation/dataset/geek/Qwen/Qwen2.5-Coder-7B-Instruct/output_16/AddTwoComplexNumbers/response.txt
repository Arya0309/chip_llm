### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `real1`: Real part of the first complex number.
  - `imag1`: Imaginary part of the first complex number.
  - `real2`: Real part of the second complex number.
  - `imag2`: Imaginary part of the second complex number.
  
- **Outputs**:
  - `real_sum`: Real part of the sum of the two complex numbers.
  - `imag_sum`: Imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Header Inclusion**:
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   This includes the standard library and uses the `std` namespace for convenience.

2. **Class Definition**:
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
       
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
       
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - A class `Complex` is defined to represent complex numbers.
   - It has two public members: `real` and `imaginary`.
   - A constructor initializes these members.
   - A method `addComp` adds two complex numbers and returns the result.

3. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` are created with specific real and imaginary parts.
   - The sum of `C1` and `C2` is computed using the `addComp` method and stored in `C3`.
   - The results are printed to the console.

### SystemC Equivalent Code

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **Module Definition**:
  - `ComplexAdder` is a SystemC module that takes four input ports (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`) and two output ports (`real_sum`, `imag_sum`).

- **Constructor**:
  - The constructor initializes the `add` method to be sensitive to changes in the input ports.

- **Method**:
  - The `add` method reads the values from the input ports and computes the sum of the real and imaginary parts separately. These sums are then written to the respective output ports.

This SystemC code snippet accurately captures the logic of the original C++ code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
