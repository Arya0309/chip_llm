### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Input**: An integer `n` (hardcoded as `153` in the code).
- **Output**: A boolean indicating whether the number is an Armstrong number or not.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int n = 153;
   int temp = n;
   int p = 0;
   ```
   - `n` is set to `153`.
   - `temp` is assigned the value of `n` to preserve the original number for later comparison.
   - `p` is initialized to `0` to store the sum of the cubes of the digits.

2. **Loop to Calculate Sum of Cubes**:
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       int rem = n % 10;
       p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
       n = n / 10;
   }
   ```
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than `0`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `rem` stores the last digit of `n` (`n % 10`).
     - `p` is updated by adding the cube of `rem` (`rem * rem * rem`).
     - `n` is divided by `10` to remove the last digit (`n = n / 10`).

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   ```cpp
   if (temp == p) {
       cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
   } else {
       cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
   }
   ```
   - The code checks if `temp` (original number) is equal to `p` (sum of cubes of digits).
   - If they are equal, it prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No.".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No.".

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that replicates the functionality of the given C++/C code. This SystemC code incorporates the provided signals (`num_in` and `is_armstrong`) for seamless integration with an existing testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong;  // Output port indicating if the number is an Armstrong number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        // Process to check if the number is an Armstrong number
        SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is an Armstrong number
    void check_armstrong() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        // Loop to calculate the sum of individual digits raised to the power of the number of digits
        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);  // Assuming 3-digit number for simplicity
            n = n / 10;
        }

        // Condition to check whether the value of P equals to user input or not
        if (temp == p) {
            is_armstrong.write(true);
        } else {
            is_armstrong.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `num_in`: An input port for the number to check.
  - `is_armstrong`: An output port indicating whether the number is an Armstrong number (`true` if it is, `false` otherwise).

- **Process**:
  - The `check_armstrong` method is triggered whenever the `num_in` signal changes.
  - It reads the value of `num_in` and processes it similarly to the C++ code:
    - Calculates the sum of the cubes of the digits.
    - Compares the sum with the original number.
    - Writes `true` to `is_armstrong` if the number is an Armstrong number, otherwise writes `false`.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
