The error message indicates that the `sensitive` member of `sc_sensitive` does not support direct assignment with `sc_vector<sc_in<int>>`. Instead, we need to iterate over the vector and add each individual signal to the sensitivity list.

Here's the revised SystemC code snippet that fixes the issue:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(AverageCalculator) {
    sc_vector<sc_in<int>> data_in;  // Input port for the array of integers
    sc_out<double> average_out;     // Output port for the average

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(AverageCalculator) : data_in("data_in", 9), average_out("average_out") {
        // Register each port in data_in as sensitive
        for (unsigned int i = 0; i < data_in.size(); i++) {
            sensitive << data_in[i];
        }

        // Process to calculate the average
        SC_METHOD(calculate_average);
        sensitive << data_in;
    }

    // Method to calculate the average
    void calculate_average() {
        int sum = 0;
        int n = data_in.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += data_in[i].read();
        }
        average_out.write(static_cast<double>(sum) / n);
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization of `data_in` and `average_out`:**
   ```cpp
   AverageCalculator(sc_module_name name) : data_in("data_in", 9), average_out("average_out") {
   ```
   This initializes the `data_in` vector with 9 elements and the `average_out` port.

2. **Registering `data_in` ports as sensitive:**
   ```cpp
   for (unsigned int i = 0; i < data_in.size(); i++) {
       sensitive << data_in[i];
   }
   ```
   This loop iterates over each element in the `data_in` vector and registers it as sensitive to ensure the process `calculate_average` is triggered whenever any of the input signals change.

3. **Process to calculate the average:**
   ```cpp
   SC_METHOD(calculate_average);
   sensitive << data_in;
   ```
   This defines a method `calculate_average` that calculates the average of the input array elements and writes it to the `average_out` port. The process is sensitive to all elements in the `data_in` vector.

4. **Method to calculate the average:**
   ```cpp
   void calculate_average() {
       int sum = 0;
       int n = data_in.size();
       for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
           sum += data_in[i].read();
       }
       average_out.write(static_cast<double>(sum) / n);
   }
   ```
   This method reads each element from the `data_in` vector, sums them up, and then calculates the average, which is written to the `average_out` port.

This revised code should now correctly handle the sensitivity list and pass the unit tests.
