### Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs**:
- `n` (integer): The number to be checked for primality.

**Outputs**:
- `is_prime` (boolean): Indicates whether the number `n` is prime (`true`) or not (`false`).

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int n = 29;
   ```
   - The variable `n` is initialized to 29. This is the number we will check for primality.

2. **Counter Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int cnt = 0;
   ```
   - A counter `cnt` is initialized to 0. This will keep track of how many divisors `n` has.

3. **Initial Check**:
   ```cpp
   if (n <= 1)
       cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;
   ```
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not a prime number. The program outputs that `n` is not prime and exits.

4. **Loop Through Possible Divisors**:
   ```cpp
   else {
       for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
           if (n % i == 0)
               cnt++;
       }
   ```
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program enters a loop that checks for divisors from 1 to `n`.
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`), the counter `cnt` is incremented.

5. **Check Divisor Count**:
   ```cpp
   if (cnt > 2)
       cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;
   else
       cout << n << " is prime" << endl;
   ```
   - After the loop, if `cnt` is greater than 2, it means `n` has more than two divisors, so it is not a prime number. The program outputs that `n` is not prime.
   - If `cnt` is 2, it means `n` has exactly two divisors (1 and itself), so it is a prime number. The program outputs that `n` is prime.

### SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that captures the logic of the original C++/C code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_prime;  // Output port indicating if the number is prime

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        // Process to check for primality
        SC_METHOD(check_prime);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is prime
    void check_prime() {
        int cnt = 0;

        // If number is less than/equal to 1, it is not prime
        if (n.read() <= 1) {
            is_prime.write(false);
        } else {
            // Check for divisors from 1 to n
            for (int i = 1; i <= n.read(); i++) {
                if (n.read() % i == 0) {
                    cnt++;
                }
            }

            // If n is divisible by more than 2 numbers, it is not prime
            if (cnt > 2) {
                is_prime.write(false);
            } else {
                is_prime.write(true);
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
       sc_in<int> n;  // Input port for the number to check
       sc_out<bool> is_prime;  // Output port indicating if the number is prime
   ```
   - A SystemC module `PrimeChecker` is declared with an input port `n` and an output port `is_prime`.

2. **Constructor**:
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
       // Process to check for primality
       SC_METHOD(check_prime);
       sensitive << n;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the module and specifies that the `check_prime` method should be triggered whenever the input `n` changes.

3. **Method to Check Primality**:
   ```cpp
   void check_prime() {
       int cnt = 0;

       // If number is less than/equal to 1, it is not prime
       if (n.read() <= 1) {
           is_prime.write(false);
       } else {
           // Check for divisors from 1 to n
           for (int i = 1; i <= n.read(); i++) {
               if (n.read() % i == 0) {
                   cnt++;
               }
           }

           // If n is divisible by more than 2 numbers, it is not prime
           if (cnt > 2) {
               is_prime.write(false);
           } else {
               is_prime.write(true);
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   - The `check_prime` method reads the value of `n` and performs the same logic as the original C++ code to determine if `n` is prime.
   - The result is written to the `is_prime` output port, which will be `true` if `n` is prime and `false` otherwise.
