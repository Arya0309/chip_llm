### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: 
  - None explicitly defined. However, the code uses a hardcoded value `n = 153`.
- **Outputs**:
  - A string indicating whether the number is an Armstrong number or not.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int n = 153;
   int temp = n;
   int p = 0;
   ```
   - `n` is initialized to `153`, which is the number to be checked.
   - `temp` is set to the value of `n` to keep the original number for comparison later.
   - `p` is initialized to `0`. This variable will store the sum of the cubes of the digits of `n`.

2. **Loop to Calculate the Sum of Cubes**:
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       int rem = n % 10;
       p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
       n = n / 10;
   }
   ```
   - This loop runs as long as `n` is greater than `0`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `rem` is calculated as the remainder when `n` is divided by `10` (i.e., the last digit of `n`).
     - `p` is updated by adding the cube of `rem` to its current value.
     - `n` is updated by removing the last digit (i.e., `n` is divided by `10`).

3. **Condition to Check Armstrong Number**:
   ```cpp
   if (temp == p) {
       cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
   } else {
       cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
   }
   ```
   - After the loop, the code checks if `temp` (the original number) is equal to `p` (the sum of the cubes of its digits).
   - If they are equal, it prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No.".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No.".

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the SystemC code that replicates the logic of the given C++/C code. This SystemC module takes an integer input `num_in` and outputs a boolean `is_armstrong` indicating whether the input number is an Armstrong number.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong; // Output port indicating if the number is an Armstrong number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        // Process to perform the Armstrong check
        SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is an Armstrong number
    void check_armstrong() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        is_armstrong.write(temp == p);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**:
   - `SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker)` declares a SystemC module named `ArmstrongChecker`.

2. **Ports**:
   - `sc_in<int> num_in`: An input port that receives the number to be checked.
   - `sc_out<bool> is_armstrong`: An output port that provides the result (true if the number is an Armstrong number, false otherwise).

3. **Constructor**:
   - `SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker)`: Initializes the module.
   - `SC_METHOD(check_armstrong)`: Registers the `check_armstrong` method to be called whenever `num_in` changes.
   - `sensitive << num_in;`: Specifies that the `check_armstrong` method should be sensitive to changes in `num_in`.

4. **Method**:
   - `void check_armstrong()`: Contains the logic to check if the input number is an Armstrong number.
   - The method reads the input number, calculates the sum of the cubes of its digits, and compares it to the original number.
   - The result (`true` or `false`) is written to the `is_armstrong` output port.

This SystemC code snippet can be integrated into a larger SystemC design and tested using the provided signals `num_in` and `is_armstrong`.
