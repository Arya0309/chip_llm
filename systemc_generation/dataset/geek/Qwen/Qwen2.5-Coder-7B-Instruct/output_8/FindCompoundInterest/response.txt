### Input and Output Summary

**Inputs:**
- `principal`: The initial amount of money (in dollars).
- `rate`: The annual interest rate (in percentage).
- `time`: The time period the money is invested or borrowed for (in years).

**Outputs:**
- `ci`: The calculated compound interest (in dollars).

### Detailed Explanation of the C++/C Code

1. **Include Headers:**
   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   ```
   - This includes all standard C++ libraries.

2. **Namespace Declaration:**
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.

3. **Main Function:**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;
   ```
   - The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
   - `principal`, `rate`, and `time` are initialized with values 10000, 5, and 2 respectively.

4. **Calculate Compound Interest:**
   ```cpp
       double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));
       double CI = A - principal;
   ```
   - `A` is calculated as the future value of the investment, which includes the principal and compound interest.
   - `CI` is calculated as the difference between `A` and the principal, which gives the total compound interest earned.

5. **Output the Result:**
   ```cpp
       cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;
   ```
   - This prints the calculated compound interest to the console.

6. **Return Statement:**
   ```cpp
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function returns 0, indicating successful execution.

### SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that incorporates the provided signals and preserves the logic of the original C++/C code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
    sc_in<double> principal;  // Input port for the principal amount
    sc_in<double> rate;       // Input port for the interest rate
    sc_in<double> time;       // Input port for the time period
    sc_out<double> ci;         // Output port for the compound interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate compound interest
        SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculate_ci() {
        double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
        double CI = A - principal.read();
        ci.write(CI);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration:**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator)
   ```
   - Defines a SystemC module named `CompoundInterestCalculator`.

2. **Input Ports:**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<double> principal;
   sc_in<double> rate;
   sc_in<double> time;
   ```
   - These are input ports for the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.

3. **Output Port:**
   ```cpp
   sc_out<double> ci;
   ```
   - This is an output port for the calculated compound interest.

4. **Constructor:**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
       SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
       sensitive << principal << rate << time;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the module and binds the `calculate_ci` method to the input ports.

5. **Method to Calculate Compound Interest:**
   ```cpp
   void calculate_ci() {
       double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
       double CI = A - principal.read();
       ci.write(CI);
   }
   ```
   - This method reads the input values from the ports.
   - It calculates the compound interest using the formula and writes the result to the output port.

This SystemC code snippet faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
