### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `real1` (int): Real part of the first complex number.
  - `imag1` (int): Imaginary part of the first complex number.
  - `real2` (int): Real part of the second complex number.
  - `imag2` (int): Imaginary part of the second complex number.
- **Outputs**:
  - `real_sum` (int): Real part of the sum of the two complex numbers.
  - `imag_sum` (int): Imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers.

#### Detailed Explanation of the Code

1. **Include Libraries**:
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   This includes all standard C++ libraries and uses the standard namespace.

2. **Class Definition**:
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - A `Complex` class is defined with public members `real` and `imaginary`.
   - A constructor initializes these members.
   - The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects and returns their sum as a new `Complex` object.

3. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` are created with initial values.
   - The sum of `C1` and `C2` is calculated and stored in `C3`.
   - The results are printed.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Module Declaration**:
  - `SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder)` defines a module named `ComplexAdder`.
  
- **Input and Output Ports**:
  - `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2` are input ports for the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
  - `real_sum`, `imag_sum` are output ports for the real and imaginary parts of the sum.

- **Constructor**:
  - `SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder)` initializes the module and sets up the method `add` to be sensitive to changes on any of the input ports.

- **Method Definition**:
  - `void add()` performs the addition of the real and imaginary parts separately and writes the results to the respective output ports.

This SystemC code snippet faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source code, allowing it to be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
