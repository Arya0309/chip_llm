### Analysis of Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: None (The code does not take any external inputs from the user or environment)
- **Outputs**: The program prints the sum of two complex numbers to the console.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Importing Libraries**
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This line imports all standard libraries and sets the `std` namespace as the default namespace.

2. **User Defined Complex Class**
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - A class `Complex` is defined to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.
   - A constructor initializes a complex number with given real and imaginary values.
   - The `addComp` method takes two complex numbers, adds their real parts and imaginary parts respectively, and returns a new complex number representing their sum.

3. **Driver Code**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Two complex numbers `C1` and `C2` are created with specified real and imaginary parts.
   - The real and imaginary parts of `C1` and `C2` are printed.
   - The `addComp` method is called to compute the sum of `C1` and `C2`, and the result is stored in `C3`.
   - The real and imaginary parts of the sum (`C3`) are printed.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **Imports and Namespace**
   ```cpp
   #include <systemc.h>
   ```
   - Imports the SystemC library.

2. **Module Definition**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
   ```
   - Defines a SystemC module named `ComplexAdder`.

3. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> real1;
   sc_in<int> imag1;
   sc_in<int> real2;
   sc_in<int> imag2;
   sc_out<int> real_sum;
   sc_out<int> imag_sum;
   ```
   - Declares input ports `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2` to receive the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
   - Declares output ports `real_sum` and `imag_sum` to send the real and imaginary parts of the sum.

4. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
       SC_METHOD(add);
       sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
   }
   ```
   - Constructs the module and binds the `add` method to the input ports.
   - Specifies that the `add` method should be triggered whenever any of the input ports change.

5. **Addition Method**
   ```cpp
   void add() {
       real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
       imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
   }
   ```
   - Reads the real and imaginary parts from the input ports.
   - Computes the sum of the real and imaginary parts separately.
   - Writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source code, allowing for high-level synthesis and integration into a testbench.
