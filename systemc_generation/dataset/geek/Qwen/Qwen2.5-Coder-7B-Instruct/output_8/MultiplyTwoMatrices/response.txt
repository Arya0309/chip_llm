### C++/C Code Analysis

**Inputs and Outputs:**
- **Inputs**: Two 2D integer arrays `mat1` and `mat2`.
- **Outputs**: The result of multiplying `mat1` and `mat2`, which is printed to the console.

**Detailed Explanation:**

1. **Header Files and Macros**:
   - The code includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is a convenience header that includes most standard library headers.
   - Macros `R1`, `C1`, `R2`, and `C2` are defined to specify the dimensions of the matrices `mat1` and `mat2`.

2. **Function `mulMat`**:
   - This function takes two 2D integer arrays `mat1` and `mat2` as input.
   - It initializes a 2D array `rslt` to store the result of the matrix multiplication.
   - The function uses nested loops to perform the multiplication:
     - The outer loop iterates over the rows of `mat1`.
     - The middle loop iterates over the columns of `mat2`.
     - The inner loop iterates over the common dimension between `mat1` and `mat2`.
   - For each element in the resulting matrix, it calculates the dot product of the corresponding row from `mat1` and column from `mat2`.
   - The result is printed to the console.

3. **Main Function**:
   - The main function initializes two matrices `mat1` and `mat2` with specific values.
   - It checks if the number of columns in `mat1` is equal to the number of rows in `mat2`. If not, it prints an error message and exits.
   - If the dimensions are valid, it calls the `mulMat` function to perform the multiplication and print the result.

### SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that captures the same behavior:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixMultiplier) {
    sc_in<int> A[2][2];  // Input port for the first matrix
    sc_in<int> B[2][3];  // Input port for the second matrix
    sc_out<int> C[2][3]; // Output port for the result matrix

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatrixMultiplier) {
        // Process to perform matrix multiplication
        SC_METHOD(multiply);
        sensitive << A << B;
    }

    // Method to perform matrix multiplication
    void multiply() {
        int rslt[2][3] = {0};  // Initialize result matrix with zeros

        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                rslt[i][j] = 0;

                for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {
                    rslt[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
                }
            }
        }

        // Write the result to the output ports
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                C[i][j].write(rslt[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**:
   - The `MatrixMultiplier` module has four ports: `A` (input), `B` (input), and `C` (output).

2. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor initializes the `multiply` method to be sensitive to changes on the `A` and `B` ports.

3. **Method `multiply`**:
   - This method performs the matrix multiplication logic.
   - It initializes a 2D array `rslt` to store the result of the multiplication.
   - Nested loops are used to iterate over the rows of `A` and the columns of `B`, calculating the dot product for each element in the resulting matrix.
   - The result is written to the `C` ports.

This SystemC code snippet faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
