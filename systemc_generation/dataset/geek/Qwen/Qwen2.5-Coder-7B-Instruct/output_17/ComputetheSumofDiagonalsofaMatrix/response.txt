### Analysis of the Provided C++ Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: 
  - A 2D integer array `mat` of size `n x n`.
  - An integer `n` representing the size of the square matrix.
- **Outputs**:
  - Two integers: the sum of the principal diagonal and the sum of the secondary diagonal of the matrix.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Header Inclusion and Namespace**
   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h> 
   using namespace std; 
   ```
   - This includes all standard C++ libraries and sets the default namespace to `std`.

2. **Constants and Function Declaration**
   ```cpp
   const int MAX = 100; 
   void printDiagonalSums(int mat[][MAX], int n) 
   ```
   - `MAX` is a constant set to 100, which is used to define the maximum size of the matrix.
   - `printDiagonalSums` is a function that takes a 2D integer array `mat` and an integer `n` as inputs.

3. **Initialization of Diagonal Sums**
   ```cpp
   int principal = 0, secondary = 0; 
   ```
   - Variables `principal` and `secondary` are initialized to 0 to store the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively.

4. **Nested Loops to Calculate Diagonal Sums**
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
   { 
       for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)	 
       { 
           if (i == j) 
               principal += mat[i][j]; 

           if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) 
               secondary += mat[i][j]; 
       } 
   } 
   ```
   - The outer loop iterates over each row.
   - The inner loop iterates over each column.
   - If the current element is on the principal diagonal (`i == j`), it is added to `principal`.
   - If the current element is on the secondary diagonal (`i + j == n - 1`), it is added to `secondary`.

5. **Output the Results**
   ```cpp
   cout << "Principal Diagonal:" << 
         principal << endl; 
   cout << "Secondary Diagonal:" << 
         secondary << endl; 
   ```
   - The sums of the principal and secondary diagonals are printed.

6. **Driver Code**
   ```cpp
   int main() 
   { 
       int a[][MAX] = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, 
                        {5, 6, 7, 8}, 
                        {1, 2, 3, 4}, 
                        {5, 6, 7, 8}}; 
       printDiagonalSums(a, 4); 
       return 0; 
   } 
   ```
   - A sample matrix `a` is defined.
   - The `printDiagonalSums` function is called with this matrix and its size.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSum) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];  // Input port for the matrix
    sc_out<int> principal;     // Output port for the principal diagonal sum
    sc_out<int> secondary;     // Output port for the secondary diagonal sum

    int n = SIZE;  // Assuming SIZE is defined somewhere in the SystemC environment

    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSum) {
        SC_METHOD(calculate_diagonals);
        sensitive << matrix;
    }

    void calculate_diagonals() {
        int principal_sum = 0, secondary_sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == j)
                    principal_sum += matrix[i][j];

                if ((i + j) == (n - 1))
                    secondary_sum += matrix[i][j];
            }
        }

        principal.write(principal_sum);
        secondary.write(secondary_sum);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(DiagonalSum) {
   ```
   - A SystemC module named `DiagonalSum` is declared.

2. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];  
   sc_out<int> principal;     
   sc_out<int> secondary;     
   ```
   - `matrix` is an array of `sc_in<int>` ports to receive the input matrix.
   - `principal` and `secondary` are `sc_out<int>` ports to output the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively.

3. **Constructor and Sensitivity List**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(DiagonalSum) {
       SC_METHOD(calculate_diagonals);
       sensitive << matrix;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the `calculate_diagonals` method to be sensitive to changes in the `matrix` input ports.

4. **Method to Calculate Diagonal Sums**
   ```cpp
   void calculate_diagonals() {
       int principal_sum = 0, secondary_sum = 0;

       for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
           for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
               if (i == j)
                   principal_sum += matrix[i][j];

               if ((i + j) == (n - 1))
                   secondary_sum += matrix[i][j];
           }
       }

       principal.write(principal_sum);
       secondary.write(secondary_sum);
   }
   ```
   - The `calculate_diagonals` method calculates the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals using nested loops.
   - The results are written to the `principal` and `secondary` output ports.

This SystemC code snippet accurately captures the logic of the original C++ code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
