### Analysis of Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `principal`: The initial amount of money (in this case, 10000).
  - `rate`: The annual interest rate (in this case, 5%).
  - `time`: The time period in years (in this case, 2 years).
- **Outputs**:
  - `CI`: The calculated compound interest.

#### Detailed Explanation
1. **Variable Declarations**:
   ```cpp
   double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;
   ```
   - This block initializes three variables: `principal`, `rate`, and `time` with the specified values.

2. **Calculate Compound Interest**:
   ```cpp
   double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));
   double CI = A - principal;
   ```
   - `A` is calculated using the formula for compound interest: \( A = P \times (1 + \frac{r}{100})^t \), where \( P \) is the principal, \( r \) is the rate, and \( t \) is the time.
   - `CI` is then calculated as the difference between the total amount `A` and the principal amount.

3. **Output the Result**:
   ```cpp
   cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;
   ```
   - This line prints the calculated compound interest to the console.

4. **Return Statement**:
   ```cpp
   return 0;
   ```
   - The program returns 0, indicating successful execution.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals and preserves the logic of the original C++/C code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
    sc_in<double> principal;  // Input port for the principal amount
    sc_in<double> rate;       // Input port for the interest rate
    sc_in<double> time;       // Input port for the time period
    sc_out<double> ci;         // Output port for the calculated compound interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate compound interest
        SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculate_ci() {
        double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
        double CI = A - principal.read();
        ci.write(CI);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator)
   ```
   - This declares a SystemC module named `CompoundInterestCalculator`.

2. **Input and Output Ports**:
   ```cpp
   sc_in<double> principal;
   sc_in<double> rate;
   sc_in<double> time;
   sc_out<double> ci;
   ```
   - These lines declare the input ports `principal`, `rate`, and `time`, and the output port `ci` as double precision floating-point numbers.

3. **Constructor**:
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
       SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
       sensitive << principal << rate << time;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the module and specifies that the `calculate_ci` method should be called whenever any of the input ports change.

4. **Method to Calculate Compound Interest**:
   ```cpp
   void calculate_ci() {
       double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
       double CI = A - principal.read();
       ci.write(CI);
   }
   ```
   - This method reads the values from the input ports, calculates the compound interest using the same formula as in the original C++ code, and writes the result to the output port `ci`.

This SystemC code snippet faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow, integrating seamlessly with the provided signals.
