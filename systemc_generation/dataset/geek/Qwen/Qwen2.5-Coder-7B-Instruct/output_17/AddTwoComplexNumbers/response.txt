### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The code does not take any inputs from the user. Instead, it uses hardcoded values for two complex numbers.
- **Outputs**: The code prints the real and imaginary parts of the sum of two complex numbers.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Imports and Namespace Declaration**
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes all standard library headers.
   - `using namespace std;` allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.

2. **Complex Class Definition**
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
   
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
   
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - A `Complex` class is defined to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.
   - A constructor initializes the real and imaginary parts.
   - The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects and returns their sum.

3. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
   
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
   
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` are created with hardcoded values.
   - The real and imaginary parts of `C1` and `C2` are printed.
   - The `addComp` method is called to calculate the sum of `C1` and `C2`, and the result is stored in `C3`.
   - The real and imaginary parts of `C3` (the sum) are printed.

### SystemC Code Snippet

To integrate this logic into a SystemC environment, we need to create a module that takes two complex numbers as inputs and produces their sum as an output. We will use the provided signals (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, `real_sum`, `imag_sum`) to interface with the testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum; // Real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum; // Imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
   ```
   - Defines a SystemC module named `ComplexAdder`.

2. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> real1;
   sc_in<int> imag1;
   sc_in<int> real2;
   sc_in<int> imag2;
   sc_out<int> real_sum;
   sc_out<int> imag_sum;
   ```
   - Declares input ports `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2` to receive the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
   - Declares output ports `real_sum` and `imag_sum` to send the real and imaginary parts of the sum.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
       SC_METHOD(add);
       sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
   }
   ```
   - Registers the `add` method to be executed whenever any of the input ports change.
   - Sensitive to changes in `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`.

4. **Addition Method**
   ```cpp
   void add() {
       real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
       imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
   }
   ```
   - Reads the values from the input ports.
   - Computes the real and imaginary parts of the sum.
   - Writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
