### Analysis of the C++ Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Two complex numbers represented by their real and imaginary parts.
- **Outputs**: The sum of the two complex numbers, also represented by their real and imaginary parts.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Imports and Class Definition**
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;

   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - **Explanation**: 
     - The `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` directive includes all standard library headers.
     - A `Complex` class is defined with public member variables `real` and `imaginary`.
     - A constructor initializes these variables.
     - The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects as parameters, adds their real and imaginary parts respectively, and returns a new `Complex` object representing the sum.

2. **Driver Code**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - Two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` are created with specific real and imaginary values.
     - The real and imaginary parts of `C1` and `C2` are printed.
     - A third `Complex` object `C3` is created and initialized to the result of adding `C1` and `C2` using the `addComp` method.
     - The real and imaginary parts of `C3` are printed.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

To create a SystemC module that replicates the functionality of the given C++ code, we need to define an input/output interface using the provided signals (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, `real_sum`, `imag_sum`). Here is the SystemC code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum; // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum; // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Definition**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
       sc_in<int> real1;  
       sc_in<int> imag1;  
       sc_in<int> real2;  
       sc_in<int> imag2;  
       sc_out<int> real_sum; 
       sc_out<int> imag_sum; 

       SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
           SC_METHOD(add);
           sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
       }

       void add() {
           real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
           imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
       }
   };
   ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - The `ComplexAdder` module is defined with input ports `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2` and output ports `real_sum` and `imag_sum`.
     - The constructor sets up a method `add` to be sensitive to changes in any of the input ports.
     - The `add` method reads the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers from the input ports, adds them, and writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
