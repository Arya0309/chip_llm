### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The code takes four integer inputs representing the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers. These inputs are not directly visible in the provided code but would typically be passed as arguments to the `addComp` method if the code were integrated into a larger program.
- **Outputs**: The code outputs the real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers. This is done using `cout` statements within the `main` function.

#### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Include Libraries**
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the standard library and uses the standard namespace to avoid prefixing with `std::`.

2. **Class Definition**
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
   ```
   - A class named `Complex` is defined with public members `real` and `imaginary` to store the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
   {
       real = tempReal;
       imaginary = tempImaginary;
   }
   ```
   - A constructor initializes the `real` and `imaginary` members with default values of 0 if no arguments are provided.

4. **Method to Add Complex Numbers**
   ```cpp
   Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
   {
       Complex temp;
       temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
       temp.imaginary = C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary;
       return temp;
   }
   ```
   - This method takes two `Complex` objects as parameters, adds their real and imaginary parts separately, and returns a new `Complex` object containing the sum.

5. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Creates two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` with specified real and imaginary parts.
   - Prints the real and imaginary parts of `C1` and `C2`.
   - Calls the `addComp` method to add `C1` and `C2`, storing the result in `C3`.
   - Prints the real and imaginary parts of `C3`.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Here's the equivalent SystemC code that integrates the provided functionality and utilizes the signals defined:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(addComplexNumbers);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void addComplexNumbers() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Module Definition**: A SystemC module named `ComplexAdder` is defined, which encapsulates the functionality of adding two complex numbers.
- **Input Ports**: The module has four input ports (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`) to receive the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
- **Output Ports**: The module has two output ports (`real_sum`, `imag_sum`) to send the real and imaginary parts of the sum.
- **Constructor**: The constructor initializes the module and sets up a process (`addComplexNumbers`) to be sensitive to changes on the input ports.
- **Method**: The `addComplexNumbers` method reads the values from the input ports, adds them, and writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code can now be integrated into a larger SystemC design or used in a high-level synthesis flow.
