### Analysis of the C++ Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The input to the program is an integer `n`, which is hardcoded as `153`.
- **Outputs**: The output of the program is a boolean value indicating whether the number is an Armstrong number or not. If the number is an Armstrong number, the output is `true`; otherwise, it is `false`.

#### Detailed Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**
   ```cpp
   int n = 153;
   int temp = n;
   int p = 0;
   ```
   - `n` is initialized to `153`.
   - `temp` is assigned the value of `n` to keep a copy of the original number.
   - `p` is initialized to `0`. This variable will store the sum of the cubes of the digits of `n`.

2. **Loop to Calculate the Sum of Cubes of Digits**
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       int rem = n % 10;
       p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
       n = n / 10;
   }
   ```
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than `0`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `rem` is calculated as the remainder when `n` is divided by `10` (i.e., the last digit of `n`).
     - `p` is updated by adding the cube of `rem` to its current value.
     - `n` is then divided by `10` to remove the last digit.

3. **Condition to Check if the Number is an Armstrong Number**
   ```cpp
   if (temp == p) {
       cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
   } else {
       cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
   }
   ```
   - The condition checks if the original number `temp` is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits `p`.
   - If they are equal, it prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No.".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No.".

### SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates the provided signals (`num_in` and `is_armstrong`) and replicates the logic of the original C++ code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong; // Output port indicating if the number is an Armstrong number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        // Process to check if the number is an Armstrong number
        SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is an Armstrong number
    void check_armstrong() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        // Loop to calculate the sum of cubes of digits
        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        // Condition to check if the number is an Armstrong number
        if (temp == p) {
            is_armstrong.write(true);
        } else {
            is_armstrong.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
   ```
   - A SystemC module named `ArmstrongChecker` is declared.

2. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> num_in;
   sc_out<bool> is_armstrong;
   ```
   - `num_in` is an input port that receives the number to be checked.
   - `is_armstrong` is an output port that indicates whether the number is an Armstrong number.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
       SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
       sensitive << num_in;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the module and binds the `check_armstrong` method to the `num_in` signal.

4. **Method to Check Armstrong Number**
   ```cpp
   void check_armstrong() {
       int n = num_in.read();
       int temp = n;
       int p = 0;

       while (n > 0) {
           int rem = n % 10;
           p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
           n = n / 10;
       }

       if (temp == p) {
           is_armstrong.write(true);
       } else {
           is_armstrong.write(false);
       }
   }
   ```
   - The `check_armstrong` method reads the input number `num_in`.
   - It then calculates the sum of the cubes of its digits and stores it in `p`.
   - Finally, it compares the original number `temp` with `p` and writes `true` to `is_armstrong` if they are equal, otherwise it writes `false`.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
