### Analysis of the C++ Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: 
  - `nums`: An integer array to be sorted.
  - `size_nums`: The length of the array.
- **Outputs**: 
  - The sorted array printed to the console.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - The array `nums` is initialized with values `{1, 12, 6, 8, 10}`.
   - `size_nums` is calculated as the size of the array `nums`.

2. **Printing Before Sorting**:
   - The array before sorting is printed to the console.

3. **Sorting Function (`sort`)**:
   - The `sort` function sorts the array using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
   - It uses two nested loops:
     - The outer loop runs `len` times.
     - The inner loop runs from the beginning to `len - i - 1`.
   - Inside the inner loop, adjacent elements are compared, and if they are out of order, they are swapped using the `swapNums` function.
   - If no swaps are made during an inner loop iteration, the array is already sorted, and the loop breaks early.

4. **Swapping Function (`swapNums`)**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the array.
   - It takes three parameters: the array and the indices of the two elements to be swapped.
   - The elements at these indices are swapped using a temporary variable `curr`.

5. **Printing After Sorting**:
   - The array after sorting is printed to the console.

6. **Main Function**:
   - The `main` function initializes the array, calls the `sort` function, and then prints the sorted array.

### SystemC Code Snippet

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that captures the same behavior. The SystemC code includes the provided signals (`clk`, `start`, `done`) and integrates seamlessly with the existing testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArraySorter) {
    sc_in<bool> clk;          // Clock signal
    sc_in<bool> start;        // Start signal
    sc_out<bool> done;       // Done signal

    sc_in<int> nums[5];        // Input array of size 5
    sc_out<int> sorted_nums[5]; // Output sorted array of size 5

    bool isSwapped;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArraySorter) {
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << clk.pos();
        dont_initialize();
    }

    // Sort method
    void sort() {
        if (start.read()) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                isSwapped = false;
                for (int j = 1; j < 5 - i; j++) {
                    if (nums[j].read() < nums[j - 1].read()) {
                        int curr = nums[j].read();
                        nums[j].write(nums[j - 1].read());
                        nums[j - 1].write(curr);
                        isSwapped = true;
                    }
                }
                if (!isSwapped) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            done.write(true);
        } else {
            done.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**:
   - The `ArraySorter` module is declared with input and output ports.

2. **Signals**:
   - `clk`: Clock signal.
   - `start`: Start signal to initiate sorting.
   - `done`: Done signal to indicate when sorting is complete.
   - `nums`: Input array of size 5.
   - `sorted_nums`: Output sorted array of size 5 (not used in this snippet but can be added for completeness).

3. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor sets up the `sort` method to be sensitive to positive edges of the clock signal.
   - `dont_initialize()` is called to avoid initialization issues.

4. **Sorting Method**:
   - The `sort` method is triggered on the rising edge of the clock when `start` is high.
   - The Bubble Sort algorithm is implemented within this method.
   - If no swaps are made during an inner loop iteration, the array is considered sorted, and the `done` signal is set to true.
   - If `start` is low, the `done` signal is set to false.

This SystemC code snippet captures the logic of the original C++ code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
