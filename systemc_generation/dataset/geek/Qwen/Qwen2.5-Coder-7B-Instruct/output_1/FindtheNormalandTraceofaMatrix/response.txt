### Input and Output Analysis

The provided C++/C code calculates the trace and normal of a square matrix. Here are the details:

#### Inputs:
- A 2D array `mat` representing the square matrix.
- An integer `n` representing the size of the matrix.

#### Outputs:
- The trace of the matrix, which is the sum of the diagonal elements.
- The normal of the matrix, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of all elements.

### Detailed Explanation of the Code

#### Declarations:
- `MAX`: A constant integer set to 100, which represents the maximum size of the matrix.
- `findNormal`: A function that calculates the normal of the matrix.
- `findTrace`: A function that calculates the trace of the matrix.
- `main`: The driver function that initializes the matrix and calls the functions to calculate the trace and normal.

#### findNormal Function:
- Initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
- Iterates through each element of the matrix.
- Adds the square of each element to `sum`.
- Returns the square root of `sum`.

#### findTrace Function:
- Initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
- Iterates through the diagonal elements of the matrix.
- Adds each diagonal element to `sum`.
- Returns `sum`.

#### main Function:
- Initializes a 5x5 matrix with specific values.
- Calls `findTrace` to calculate the trace and prints it.
- Calls `findNormal` to calculate the normal and prints it.

### SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixAnalyzer) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE]; // Input port for the matrix
    sc_out<int> trace;       // Output port for the trace
    sc_out<int> norm;        // Output port for the normal

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatrixAnalyzer) {
        // Process to calculate trace and normal
        SC_METHOD(calculate);
        sensitive << matrix;
    }

    // Method to calculate trace and normal
    void calculate() {
        int n = SIZE; // Assuming SIZE is defined somewhere in the system
        int sum_trace = 0;
        int sum_norm = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                sum_norm += matrix[i][j] * matrix[i][j];
                if (i == j) {
                    sum_trace += matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
        }

        trace.write(sum_trace);
        norm.write(sqrt(sum_norm));
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- `MatrixAnalyzer`: A SystemC module that encapsulates the functionality of the original C++/C code.
- `matrix`: An input port that takes a 2D array representing the matrix.
- `trace`: An output port that provides the trace of the matrix.
- `norm`: An output port that provides the normal of the matrix.
- `calculate`: A method that performs the calculations for trace and normal.
- `sum_trace`: Accumulates the sum of diagonal elements (trace).
- `sum_norm`: Accumulates the sum of squares of all elements (normal).

This SystemC code should be able to integrate seamlessly with the existing testbench using the provided signals.
