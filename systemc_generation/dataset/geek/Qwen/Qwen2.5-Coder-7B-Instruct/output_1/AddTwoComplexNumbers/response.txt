### Analysis of the C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Two complex numbers represented as pairs of integers `(real1, imag1)` and `(real2, imag2)`.
- **Outputs**: The sum of the two complex numbers as a pair of integers `(real_sum, imag_sum)`.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Include Libraries**
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the standard C++ library and uses the standard namespace.

2. **Complex Class Definition**
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;

       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }

       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - A `Complex` class is defined with public members `real` and `imaginary`.
   - A constructor initializes these members with default values if not provided.
   - The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects as parameters, adds their real and imaginary parts respectively, and returns a new `Complex` object representing their sum.

3. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;

       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;

       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);

       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Creates two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` with specified real and imaginary parts.
   - Prints the details of both complex numbers.
   - Creates a third `Complex` object `C3` and assigns it the sum of `C1` and `C2` using the `addComp` method.
   - Prints the sum of the two complex numbers.

### SystemC Code Snippet

To integrate this functionality into a SystemC environment, we need to define a module that accepts the provided signals and performs the same operations. Here's how the SystemC code would look:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum; // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum; // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **Module Declaration**: `SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder)`
  - Defines a SystemC module named `ComplexAdder`.

- **Input and Output Ports**:
  - `sc_in<int> real1`, `sc_in<int> imag1`, `sc_in<int> real2`, `sc_in<int> imag2`: These are the input ports for the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
  - `sc_out<int> real_sum`, `sc_out<int> imag_sum`: These are the output ports for the real and imaginary parts of the sum.

- **Constructor**:
  - `SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder)`: Initializes the module.
  - `SC_METHOD(add)`: Registers the `add` method to be called whenever any of the input ports change.
  - `sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2`: Specifies that the `add` method should be sensitive to changes in any of the input ports.

- **Method `add`**:
  - Reads the values from the input ports.
  - Computes the sum of the real and imaginary parts.
  - Writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C program, allowing it to be integrated into a larger SystemC design and tested with the provided signals.
