### Analysis of the C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: 
  - `int mat[R][C]`: A 2D array representing the matrix to be rotated.
  - `int m`: Number of rows in the matrix.
  - `int n`: Number of columns in the matrix.
  
- **Outputs**: 
  - The rotated matrix is printed to the console.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Function Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   void rotatematrix(int m, int n, int mat[R][C])
   ```
   - This function takes the dimensions of the matrix (`m` and `n`) and the matrix itself (`mat`) as inputs.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int row = 0, col = 0;
   int prev, curr;
   ```
   - `row` and `col` are initialized to 0 to start from the top-left corner of the matrix.
   - `prev` and `curr` are used to store intermediate values during the rotation process.

3. **While Loop**:
   ```cpp
   while (row < m && col < n)
   ```
   - This loop continues until all elements have been rotated.

4. **Boundary Conditions**:
   ```cpp
   if (row + 1 == m || col + 1 == n) break;
   ```
   - If rotating one full layer is complete (either the next row or column is out of bounds), the loop breaks.

5. **First Row Rotation**:
   ```cpp
   prev = mat[row + 1][col];
   for (int i = col; i < n; i++)
   {
       curr = mat[row][i];
       mat[row][i] = prev;
       prev = curr;
   }
   row++;
   ```
   - The first element of the next row is stored in `prev`.
   - Elements of the first row are shifted rightwards.
   - `row` is incremented to move to the next row.

6. **Last Column Rotation**:
   ```cpp
   prev = mat[m-1][n-1];
   for (int i = row; i < m; i++)
   {
       curr = mat[i][n-1];
       mat[i][n-1] = prev;
       prev = curr;
   }
   n--;
   ```
   - The last element of the current column is stored in `prev`.
   - Elements of the last column are shifted downwards.
   - `n` is decremented to move to the previous column.

7. **Last Row Rotation**:
   ```cpp
   prev = mat[m-1][col];
   for (int i = n-1; i >= col; i--)
   {
       curr = mat[m-1][i];
       mat[m-1][i] = prev;
       prev = curr;
   }
   m--;
   ```
   - The first element of the last row is stored in `prev`.
   - Elements of the last row are shifted leftwards.
   - `m` is decremented to move to the previous row.

8. **First Column Rotation**:
   ```cpp
   prev = mat[row][col];
   for (int i = m-1; i >= row; i--)
   {
       curr = mat[i][col];
       mat[i][col] = prev;
       prev = curr;
   }
   col++;
   ```
   - The last element of the current column is stored in `prev`.
   - Elements of the first column are shifted upwards.
   - `col` is incremented to move to the next column.

9. **Printing the Rotated Matrix**:
   ```cpp
   for (int i=0; i<R; i++)
   {
       for (int j=0; j<C; j++)
       cout << mat[i][j] << " ";
       cout << endl;
   }
   ```
   - The rotated matrix is printed to the console.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixRotator) {
    sc_in<int> in[SIZE][SIZE];  // Input ports for the matrix
    sc_out<int> out[SIZE][SIZE]; // Output ports for the rotated matrix

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatrixRotator) {
        // Process to perform matrix rotation
        SC_METHOD(rotate_matrix);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    // Method to rotate the matrix
    void rotate_matrix() {
        int m = SIZE;
        int n = SIZE;
        int row = 0, col = 0;
        int prev, curr;

        while (row < m && col < n) {
            if (row + 1 == m || col + 1 == n) break;

            prev = in[row + 1][col];
            for (int i = col; i < n; i++) {
                curr = in[row][i];
                out[row][i] = prev;
                prev = curr;
            }
            row++;

            prev = in[m-1][n-1];
            for (int i = row; i < m; i++) {
                curr = in[i][n-1];
                out[i][n-1] = prev;
                prev = curr;
            }
            n--;

            prev = in[m-1][col];
            for (int i = n-1; i >= col; i--) {
                curr = in[m-1][i];
                out[m-1][i] = prev;
                prev = curr;
            }
            m--;

            prev = in[row][col];
            for (int i = m-1; i >= row; i--) {
                curr = in[i][col];
                out[i][col] = prev;
                prev = curr;
            }
            col++;
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Module Declaration**:
  - `MatrixRotator` is a SystemC module that takes a 2D array of integers as input and outputs the rotated matrix.
  
- **Input and Output Ports**:
  - `in[SIZE][SIZE]`: An array of input ports to receive the matrix.
  - `out[SIZE][SIZE]`: An array of output ports to send the rotated matrix.
  
- **Constructor**:
  - The constructor initializes the `rotate_matrix` method to be sensitive to changes in the input ports.

- **Rotation Logic**:
  - The `rotate_matrix` method contains the same logic as the original C++ code to rotate the matrix.
  - The matrix is rotated layer by layer, and the rotated matrix is written to the output ports.

This SystemC code should be compiled and integrated into a testbench to verify its functionality.
