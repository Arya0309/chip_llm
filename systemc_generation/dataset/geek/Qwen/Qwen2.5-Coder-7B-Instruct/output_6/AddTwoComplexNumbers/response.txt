### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Two complex numbers represented as `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`.
- **Outputs**: The sum of the two complex numbers, represented as `real_sum` and `imag_sum`.

#### Detailed Explanation Line-by-Line

1. **Include Libraries**
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   ```
   - This line includes all standard C++ libraries.

2. **Namespace Declaration**
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This line allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.

3. **Class Definition**
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
   ```
   - A class named `Complex` is defined with public member variables `real` and `imaginary`.

4. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the `real` and `imaginary` members with the provided values.

5. **Method to Add Complex Numbers**
   ```cpp
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary;
           return temp;
       }
   ```
   - This method takes two `Complex` objects as parameters, adds their real and imaginary parts respectively, and returns a new `Complex` object representing their sum.

6. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function creates two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2`, prints them, calculates their sum using the `addComp` method, and prints the result.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

To convert the above C++/C code into SystemC, we need to create a module that takes two complex numbers as inputs and produces their sum as outputs. We will use the provided signals (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, `real_sum`, `imag_sum`) to interface with the SystemC testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
   ```
   - A SystemC module named `ComplexAdder` is declared.

2. **Input Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> real1;
   sc_in<int> imag1;
   sc_in<int> real2;
   sc_in<int> imag2;
   ```
   - These ports are used to receive the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.

3. **Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_out<int> real_sum;
   sc_out<int> imag_sum;
   ```
   - These ports are used to send the real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers.

4. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
       SC_METHOD(add);
       sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor connects the `add` method to the input ports and specifies that the `add` method should be called whenever any of the input ports change.

5. **Method to Add Complex Numbers**
   ```cpp
   void add() {
       real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
       imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
   }
   ```
   - This method reads the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers from the input ports, adds them, and writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code accurately represents the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
