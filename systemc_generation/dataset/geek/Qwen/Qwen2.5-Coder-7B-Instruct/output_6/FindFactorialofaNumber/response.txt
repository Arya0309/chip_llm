### C++ Code Analysis

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: None (the `num` variable is hardcoded within the code)
- **Outputs**: The factorial of the number, printed to the console

#### Detailed Explanation
1. **Include and Namespace**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the standard input-output stream library and uses the standard namespace to avoid prefixing `std::` before standard library functions.

2. **Function Declaration**
   ```cpp
   unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
   ```
   - Declares a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` and returns an unsigned integer.

3. **Factorial Calculation**
   ```cpp
   int res = 1, i;
   for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)
       res *= i;
   return res;
   ```
   - Initializes `res` to 1 (factorial of 0 is 1).
   - Iterates from 2 to `n`, multiplying `res` by each number in this range to compute the factorial.

4. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int num = 5;
       cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is "
            << factorial(num) << endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - Defines the `main` function, which serves as the entry point of the program.
   - Sets `num` to 5.
   - Calls the `factorial` function with `num` and prints the result to the console.

### SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that captures the logic of the original C++ code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port for the number
    sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
        // Process to calculate factorial
        SC_METHOD(calculate_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    // Method to calculate the factorial
    void calculate_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read();
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code
1. **Include and Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   #include <systemc.h>
   SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
   ```
   - Includes the SystemC library and declares a module named `Factorial`.

2. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port for the number
   sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial
   ```
   - Defines input and output ports for the module.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
       SC_METHOD(calculate_factorial);
       sensitive << in;
   }
   ```
   - Constructs the module and binds the `calculate_factorial` method to the input signal `in`.

4. **Factorial Calculation Method**
   ```cpp
   void calculate_factorial() {
       unsigned int n = in.read();
       unsigned int res = 1;
       for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
           res *= i;
       }
       out.write(res);
   }
   ```
   - Reads the input value `n`.
   - Initializes `res` to 1.
   - Iterates from 2 to `n`, multiplying `res` by each number in this range to compute the factorial.
   - Writes the computed factorial to the output port `out`.

This SystemC code snippet faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
