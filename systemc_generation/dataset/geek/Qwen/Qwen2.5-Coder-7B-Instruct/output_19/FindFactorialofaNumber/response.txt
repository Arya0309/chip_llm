### C++/C Code Analysis

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The input to this program is an integer `num` which is set to 5 in the `main` function.
- **Outputs**: The output of the program is the factorial of the input number `num`, which is printed to the console.

#### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Include Directive**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   ```
   - This line includes the iostream library which is necessary for input/output operations.

2. **Using Namespace**
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This line allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.

3. **Function Declaration**
   ```cpp
   unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
   ```
   - This line declares a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as input and returns an unsigned integer.

4. **Variable Declaration and Initialization**
   ```cpp
   int res = 1, i;
   ```
   - This line declares two variables: `res` initialized to 1 (to store the factorial result), and `i` (used in the loop).

5. **For Loop**
   ```cpp
   for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)
       res *= i;
   ```
   - This loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n`. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of `res` by `i`.

6. **Return Statement**
   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```
   - This line returns the computed factorial value.

7. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int num = 5;
       cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is "
           << factorial(num) << endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - This is the entry point of the program. It initializes `num` to 5 and then calls the `factorial` function with `num` as the argument. The result is printed to the console.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

To integrate this logic into a SystemC design, we need to create a module that takes an input, computes the factorial, and produces an output. Here's how you can do it:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port for the number
    sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial

    SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
        // Process to compute the factorial
        SC_METHOD(compute_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    void compute_factorial() {
        unsigned int res = 1, i;
        for (i = 2; i <= in.read(); i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Include Directive**
   ```cpp
   #include <systemc.h>
   ```
   - This line includes the SystemC library which is necessary for building SystemC models.

2. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
   ```
   - This line declares a SystemC module named `Factorial`.

3. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port for the number
   sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial
   ```
   - These lines declare the input (`in`) and output (`out`) ports of the module.

4. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
       // Process to compute the factorial
       SC_METHOD(compute_factorial);
       sensitive << in;
   }
   ```
   - This constructor sets up the module and binds the `compute_factorial` method to the input signal `in`.

5. **Method to Compute Factorial**
   ```cpp
   void compute_factorial() {
       unsigned int res = 1, i;
       for (i = 2; i <= in.read(); i++) {
           res *= i;
       }
       out.write(res);
   }
   ```
   - This method reads the input value, computes the factorial using a loop, and writes the result to the output port.

This SystemC code snippet faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a larger SystemC design for high-level synthesis.
