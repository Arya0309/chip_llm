### Analysis of the C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Two complex numbers represented as `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`.
- **Outputs**: The sum of the two complex numbers, represented as `real_sum` and `imag_sum`.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Include Libraries**:
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   This includes all standard C++ libraries and uses the standard namespace.

2. **Complex Class Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
   ```
   A class named `Complex` is declared with public members `real` and `imaginary`.

3. **Constructor**:
   ```cpp
   Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
   {
       real = tempReal;
       imaginary = tempImaginary;
   }
   ```
   The constructor initializes the `real` and `imaginary` members with default values of 0 if not provided.

4. **Addition Method**:
   ```cpp
   Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
   {
       Complex temp;
       temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
       temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
       return temp;
   }
   ```
   The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects, adds their real and imaginary parts, and returns a new `Complex` object representing the sum.

5. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` are created with specified real and imaginary parts.
   - The sum of `C1` and `C2` is calculated using the `addComp` method and stored in `C3`.
   - The results are printed to the console.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **Module Declaration**: 
  ```cpp
  SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder)
  ```
  A SystemC module named `ComplexAdder` is declared.

- **Input Ports**:
  ```cpp
  sc_in<int> real1;
  sc_in<int> imag1;
  sc_in<int> real2;
  sc_in<int> imag2;
  ```
  Four input ports are defined to receive the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.

- **Output Ports**:
  ```cpp
  sc_out<int> real_sum;
  sc_out<int> imag_sum;
  ```
  Two output ports are defined to send the real and imaginary parts of the sum.

- **Constructor**:
  ```cpp
  SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
      SC_METHOD(add);
      sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
  }
  ```
  The constructor initializes a process `add` that is sensitive to changes in any of the input ports.

- **Addition Method**:
  ```cpp
  void add() {
      real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
      imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
  }
  ```
  The `add` method reads the values from the input ports, performs the addition, and writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source, allowing for integration into a high-level synthesis flow.
