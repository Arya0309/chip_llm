### Analysis of the Provided C++ Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Two complex numbers represented by their real and imaginary parts.
- **Outputs**: The sum of the two complex numbers, also represented by their real and imaginary parts.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Header Inclusion and Namespace Declaration**
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes all standard library headers, and `using namespace std;` allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.

2. **Class Definition for Complex Numbers**
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
   ```
   - A class `Complex` is defined with public member variables `real` and `imaginary`.

3. **Constructor for Complex Numbers**
   ```cpp
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
   ```
   - A constructor initializes the `real` and `imaginary` members with the provided values. Default values are `0` if not specified.

4. **Method to Add Two Complex Numbers**
   ```cpp
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary;
           return temp;
       }
   ```
   - This method takes two `Complex` objects, adds their real and imaginary parts separately, and returns a new `Complex` object representing their sum.

5. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function creates two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2`, prints them, calculates their sum using the `addComp` method, and prints the result.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The `ComplexAdder` module has four input ports (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`) and two output ports (`real_sum`, `imag_sum`) to represent the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers and their sum.
  
- **Constructor**: The constructor sets up the module to call the `add` method whenever any of the input ports change.

- **Method to Add Two Complex Numbers**: The `add` method reads the values from the input ports, adds the real and imaginary parts separately, and writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ code, allowing it to be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
