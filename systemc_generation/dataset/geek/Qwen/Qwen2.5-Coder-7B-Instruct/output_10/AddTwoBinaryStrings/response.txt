### Input and Output Analysis

**Inputs:**
- `A`: A string representing a binary number.
- `B`: A string representing a binary number.

**Outputs:**
- `sum`: A string representing the binary sum of `A` and `B`.

### Detailed Explanation of the C++ Code

1. **Function Declaration and Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   string addBinary(string A, string B)
   ```
   - This function takes two binary strings `A` and `B` as input and returns their sum as a binary string.

2. **Handling Length Mismatch:**
   ```cpp
   if (A.length() > B.length())
       return addBinary(B, A);
   ```
   - If the length of `A` is greater than the length of `B`, the function calls itself recursively with the arguments swapped. This ensures that `A` is always the shorter string, simplifying the logic.

3. **Padding Shorter String:**
   ```cpp
   int diff = B.length() - A.length();
   string padding;
   for (int i = 0; i < diff; i++)
       padding.push_back('0');
   A = padding + A;
   ```
   - The function calculates the difference in lengths between `A` and `B`. It then pads `A` with zeros on the left to match the length of `B`.

4. **Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   string res;
   char carry = '0';
   ```
   - `res` is used to store the result of the addition. `carry` is initialized to '0' to handle any carry from the addition.

5. **Loop Through Characters:**
   ```cpp
   for (int i = A.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--)
   ```
   - The loop iterates through the characters of `A` and `B` from right to left.

6. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** Both characters are '1'
     ```cpp
     if (A[i] == '1' && B[i] == '1')
     ```
     - If both characters are '1', a carry is generated if there is already a carry. Otherwise, a '0' is added to the result and a carry is set.

   - **Case 2:** Both characters are '0'
     ```cpp
     else if (A[i] == '0' && B[i] == '0')
     ```
     - If both characters are '0', a carry is added to the result if there is a carry. Otherwise, a '0' is added to the result and no carry is set.

   - **Case 3:** Characters are different ('0' and '1' or '1' and '0')
     ```cpp
     else if (A[i] != B[i])
     ```
     - If the characters are different, a carry is added to the result if there is a carry. Otherwise, a '1' is added to the result and no carry is set.

7. **Handling Final Carry:**
   ```cpp
   if (carry == '1')
       res.push_back(carry);
   ```
   - After the loop, if there is still a carry, it is added to the result.

8. **Reversing and Removing Leading Zeros:**
   ```cpp
   reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
   int index = 0;
   while (index + 1 < res.length() && res[index] == '0')
       index++;
   return (res.substr(index));
   ```
   - The result is reversed and leading zeros are removed before returning.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinaryAdder) {
    sc_in<std::string> A;  // Input port for the first binary string
    sc_in<std::string> B;  // Input port for the second binary string
    sc_out<std::string> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinaryAdder) {
        // Process to perform binary addition
        SC_METHOD(add_binary);
        sensitive << A << B;
    }

    // Method to add the two binary strings
    void add_binary() {
        std::string a = A.read();
        std::string b = B.read();

        if (a.length() > b.length())
            return add_binary(b, a);

        int diff = b.length() - a.length();
        std::string padding;
        for (int i = 0; i < diff; i++)
            padding += '0';
        a = padding + a;

        std::string res;
        char carry = '0';

        for (int i = a.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (a[i] == '1' && b[i] == '1') {
                if (carry == '1')
                    res += '1', carry = '1';
                else
                    res += '0', carry = '1';
            } else if (a[i] == '0' && b[i] == '0') {
                if (carry == '1')
                    res += '1', carry = '0';
                else
                    res += '0', carry = '0';
            } else {
                if (carry == '1')
                    res += '0', carry = '1';
                else
                    res += '1', carry = '0';
            }
        }

        if (carry == '1')
            res += carry;

        reverse(res.begin(), res.end());

        int index = 0;
        while (index + 1 < res.length() && res[index] == '0')
            index++;

        sum.write(res.substr(index));
    }
};
```

This SystemC code defines a module `BinaryAdder` that takes two input strings `A` and `B` and produces their binary sum on the output `sum`. The logic closely mirrors the provided C++ code, ensuring that the same operations are performed in a manner suitable for high-level synthesis.
