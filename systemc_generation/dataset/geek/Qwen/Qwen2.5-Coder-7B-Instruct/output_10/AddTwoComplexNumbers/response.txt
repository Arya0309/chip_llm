### Input and Output Analysis

**Inputs**:
- `real1`: Real part of the first complex number.
- `imag1`: Imaginary part of the first complex number.
- `real2`: Real part of the second complex number.
- `imag2`: Imaginary part of the second complex number.

**Outputs**:
- `real_sum`: Real part of the sum of the two complex numbers.
- `imag_sum`: Imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Include Libraries**:
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the standard library and uses the standard namespace for simplicity.

2. **User Defined Complex Class**:
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - A class `Complex` is defined with public members `real` and `imaginary`.
   - A constructor initializes these members.
   - The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects and returns their sum as a new `Complex` object.

3. **Driver Code**:
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` are created with specified real and imaginary parts.
   - The real and imaginary parts of `C1` and `C2` are printed.
   - A third `Complex` object `C3` is created and assigned the result of adding `C1` and `C2`.
   - The real and imaginary parts of `C3` are printed.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
   ```
   - A SystemC module named `ComplexAdder` is declared.

2. **Input and Output Ports**:
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> real1;
   sc_in<int> imag1;
   sc_in<int> real2;
   sc_in<int> imag2;
   sc_out<int> real_sum;
   sc_out<int> imag_sum;
   ```
   - Input ports `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2` are declared to receive the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
   - Output ports `real_sum` and `imag_sum` are declared to send the real and imaginary parts of the sum.

3. **Constructor**:
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
       SC_METHOD(add);
       sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor connects the `add` method to the sensitive signals (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`).

4. **Add Method**:
   ```cpp
   void add() {
       real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
       imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
   }
   ```
   - The `add` method reads the values from the input ports, adds them, and writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code accurately captures the logic of the original C++/C program, allowing it to be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
