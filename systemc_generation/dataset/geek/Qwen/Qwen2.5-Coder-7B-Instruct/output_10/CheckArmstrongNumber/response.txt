### Input and Output

**Inputs:**
- None (The code does not accept any external inputs. The number to be checked is hardcoded within the code.)

**Outputs:**
- `is_armstrong`: A boolean signal indicating whether the number is an Armstrong number or not.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int n = 153;
   int temp = n;
   int p = 0;
   ```
   - `n` is initialized to 153, which is the number to be checked.
   - `temp` is set to the value of `n`, preserving the original number for comparison later.
   - `p` is initialized to 0, which will hold the sum of the cubes of the digits.

2. **Loop to Calculate the Sum of Cubes of Digits**:
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       int rem = n % 10;
       p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
       n = n / 10;
   }
   ```
   - The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `rem` is calculated as the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 (i.e., the last digit of `n`).
     - `p` is updated by adding the cube of `rem` to it.
     - `n` is then divided by 10 to remove the last digit.

3. **Condition to Check if the Number is an Armstrong Number**:
   ```cpp
   if (temp == p) {
       cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
   } else {
       cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
   }
   ```
   - The code checks if the original number (`temp`) is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits (`p`).
   - If they are equal, it prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No." Otherwise, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No."

### SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that captures the same logic and integrates with the provided signals:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong;  // Output port indicating if the number is an Armstrong number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        // Process to check if the number is an Armstrong number
        SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is an Armstrong number
    void check_armstrong() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        // Loop to calculate the sum of cubes of digits
        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        // Condition to check if the number is an Armstrong number
        if (temp == p) {
            is_armstrong.write(true);
        } else {
            is_armstrong.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**:
   - `ArmstrongChecker` is declared as a SystemC module with an input port `num_in` and an output port `is_armstrong`.

2. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor initializes the module and sets up a method `check_armstrong` to be sensitive to changes in `num_in`.

3. **Method to Check Armstrong Number**:
   - The `check_armstrong` method reads the input number, calculates the sum of the cubes of its digits, and compares it to the original number.
   - If the number is an Armstrong number, `is_armstrong` is set to `true`; otherwise, it is set to `false`.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
