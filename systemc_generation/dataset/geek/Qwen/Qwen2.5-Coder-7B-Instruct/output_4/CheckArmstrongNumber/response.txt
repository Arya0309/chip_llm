### C++/C Code Analysis

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The input to the program is a single integer `n`, which is hardcoded to `153` in this case.
- **Outputs**: The program outputs a boolean value indicating whether the input number is an Armstrong number or not. If the number is an Armstrong number, it prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No." Otherwise, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No."

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**
   ```cpp
   int n = 153;
   int temp = n;
   int p = 0;
   ```
   - `n` is initialized to `153`.
   - `temp` is set to the value of `n` to preserve the original number for comparison later.
   - `p` is initialized to `0`. This variable will store the sum of the cubes of the digits of `n`.

2. **Loop to Calculate Sum of Cubes**
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       int rem = n % 10;
       p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
       n = n / 10;
   }
   ```
   - A `while` loop runs as long as `n` is greater than `0`.
   - Inside the loop, `rem` is calculated as the remainder when `n` is divided by `10` (i.e., the last digit of `n`).
   - `p` is updated by adding the cube of `rem` to its current value.
   - `n` is then divided by `10` to remove the last digit.

3. **Comparison and Output**
   ```cpp
   if (temp == p) {
       cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
   } else {
       cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
   }
   ```
   - The program checks if `temp` (the original number) is equal to `p` (the sum of the cubes of the digits).
   - If they are equal, it prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No."
   - Otherwise, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No."

### SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that incorporates the provided signals and captures the same logic:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong;  // Output port for the result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        // Process to check if the number is an Armstrong number
        SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is an Armstrong number
    void check_armstrong() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        // Loop to calculate sum of cubes of individual digits
        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        // Condition to check whether the value of P equals to user input or not
        if (temp == p) {
            is_armstrong.write(true);
        } else {
            is_armstrong.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
   ```
   - Defines a SystemC module named `ArmstrongChecker`.

2. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> num_in;
   sc_out<bool> is_armstrong;
   ```
   - `num_in` is an input port for the number to be checked.
   - `is_armstrong` is an output port that will indicate whether the number is an Armstrong number.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
       SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
       sensitive << num_in;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the module.
   - `check_armstrong` is registered as a method to be called whenever `num_in` changes.

4. **Method to Check Armstrong Number**
   ```cpp
   void check_armstrong() {
       int n = num_in.read();
       int temp = n;
       int p = 0;

       while (n > 0) {
           int rem = n % 10;
           p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
           n = n / 10;
       }

       if (temp == p) {
           is_armstrong.write(true);
       } else {
           is_armstrong.write(false);
       }
   }
   ```
   - This method reads the value of `num_in`.
   - It calculates the sum of the cubes of the digits and stores it in `p`.
   - It compares `temp` (the original number) with `p`.
   - Depending on the comparison, it writes `true` or `false` to `is_armstrong`.

This SystemC code accurately captures the logic of the original C++/C program and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
