### Analysis of the C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The code takes a single integer `n` as input.
- **Outputs**: The code outputs the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

#### Detailed Explanation Line-by-Line

1. **Include Statement**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   ```
   - This line includes the iostream library, which is necessary for input and output operations.

2. **Namespace Declaration**
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This line declares the standard namespace, allowing us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.

3. **Function Declaration**
   ```cpp
   int findSum(int n)
   ```
   - This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

4. **Variable Declaration**
   ```cpp
   int sum = 0;
   ```
   - This line declares a variable `sum` and initializes it to 0. This variable will store the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

5. **For Loop**
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
   ```
   - This loop iterates from 1 to `n`, adding each value of `i` to the `sum`.

6. **Sum Calculation**
   ```cpp
   sum = sum + i;
   ```
   - Inside the loop, this line adds the current value of `i` to `sum`.

7. **Return Statement**
   ```cpp
   return sum;
   ```
   - This line returns the calculated sum after the loop completes.

8. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   ```
   - The main function serves as the entry point of the program.

9. **Variable Declaration**
   ```cpp
   int n = 5;
   ```
   - This line declares a variable `n` and initializes it to 5. This value is passed to the `findSum` function.

10. **Function Call**
    ```cpp
    cout << findSum(n);
    ```
    - This line calls the `findSum` function with `n` as an argument and prints the result using `cout`.

11. **Return Statement**
    ```cpp
    return 0;
    ```
    - This line indicates that the program has executed successfully.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that captures the same logic and integrates with the provided signals:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SumCalculator) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> n;  // Input port for the number of terms
    sc_out<unsigned int> result;  // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SumCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate the sum
        SC_METHOD(calculateSum);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers
    void calculateSum() {
        unsigned int sum = 0;
        for (unsigned int i = 1; i <= n.read(); i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        result.write(sum);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Module Declaration**
  ```cpp
  SC_MODULE(SumCalculator)
  ```
  - This line declares a SystemC module named `SumCalculator`.

- **Input and Output Ports**
  ```cpp
  sc_in<unsigned int> n;
  sc_out<unsigned int> result;
  ```
  - These lines declare the input port `n` and the output port `result`. These ports are connected to the provided signals.

- **Constructor**
  ```cpp
  SC_CTOR(SumCalculator) {
      SC_METHOD(calculateSum);
      sensitive << n;
  }
  ```
  - This constructor sets up the `calculateSum` method to be sensitive to changes on the `n` port.

- **Method to Calculate Sum**
  ```cpp
  void calculateSum() {
      unsigned int sum = 0;
      for (unsigned int i = 1; i <= n.read(); i++) {
          sum += i;
      }
      result.write(sum);
  }
  ```
  - This method calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using a loop and writes the result to the `result` port.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
