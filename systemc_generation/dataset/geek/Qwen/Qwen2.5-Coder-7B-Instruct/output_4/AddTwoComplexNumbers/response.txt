### Analysis of the C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Two complex numbers represented by their real and imaginary parts.
- **Outputs**: The sum of the two complex numbers, also represented by their real and imaginary parts.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Class Definition**:
   - A class named `Complex` is defined to represent a complex number.
   - It has two public member variables: `real` and `imaginary`, representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.
   - A constructor is provided to initialize these variables with default values of 0 if not specified.

2. **Method Definition**:
   - The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects as parameters and returns a new `Complex` object that represents the sum of the two input complex numbers.
   - Inside the method, a temporary `Complex` object `temp` is created.
   - The real part of `temp` is set to the sum of the real parts of the input complex numbers.
   - The imaginary part of `temp` is set to the sum of the imaginary parts of the input complex numbers.
   - The temporary `Complex` object `temp` is then returned.

3. **Driver Code**:
   - In the `main` function, two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` are created with specific real and imaginary parts.
   - The sum of `C1` and `C2` is calculated using the `addComp` method and stored in `C3`.
   - The real and imaginary parts of `C3` are printed to the console.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals and preserves the logic of the original C++/C code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        // Calculate the real part of the sum
        int sum_real = real1.read() + real2.read();
        // Calculate the imaginary part of the sum
        int sum_imag = imag1.read() + imag2.read();
        // Write the results to the output ports
        real_sum.write(sum_real);
        imag_sum.write(sum_imag);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**:
   - A SystemC module named `ComplexAdder` is declared to handle the addition of two complex numbers.
   - It has four input ports (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`) to receive the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
   - It has two output ports (`real_sum`, `imag_sum`) to send the real and imaginary parts of the sum.

2. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor initializes the module and sets up a method to handle the addition operation.
   - The method `add` is sensitive to changes in any of the input ports.

3. **Addition Method**:
   - The `add` method reads the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers from the input ports.
   - It calculates the real and imaginary parts of the sum.
   - The results are written to the output ports.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
