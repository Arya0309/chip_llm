The runtime error indicates that the `lcm_result` port is not properly bound to an actual signal or object in the testbench. This is causing a failure when trying to access or write to the `lcm_result` port.

### Analysis:

1. **Nature of the Runtime Failure**: The error message `(E112) get interface failed: port is not bound: port 'tb.lcm_inst.port_0' (sc_in)` suggests that the `lcm_result` port in the `LcmCalculator` module is not connected to any external signal or object in the testbench. This results in a runtime error because the port is being accessed without a valid connection.

2. **Function or Line Where the Error Occurs**: The error occurs during the simulation run when the `find_lcm` method tries to write to the `lcm_result` port. The exact line within the `find_lcm` method where the error occurs is not explicitly given, but it is likely related to the attempt to write to the `lcm_result` port.

3. **Underlying Cause**: The underlying cause is the unconnected `lcm_result` port. Since the port is not bound to any external signal or object, attempting to write to it results in a runtime error.

4. **Proposed Adjustments**: To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `lcm_result` port is properly connected to an external signal or object in the testbench. This involves modifying the testbench to bind the `lcm_result` port to a specific signal.

5. **Revised Code Section**:
   - In the testbench, we need to instantiate the `LcmCalculator` module and bind the `lcm_result` port to a specific signal.

### Revised SystemC Module Code:

Here is the complete, fixed SystemC module code with the necessary adjustments:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates the LCM of two integers
SC_MODULE(LcmCalculator) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> lcm_result; // Output port for the LCM result

    int max_num;
    bool flag;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LcmCalculator) {
        // Initialize variables
        max_num = (a.read() > b.read()) ? a.read() : b.read();
        flag = true;

        // Process to find the LCM
        SC_METHOD(find_lcm);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to find the LCM
    void find_lcm() {
        while (flag) {
            if (max_num % a.read() == 0 && max_num % b.read() == 0) {
                lcm_result.write(max_num);
                flag = false;
                break;
            }
            ++max_num;
        }
    }
};

// Testbench module
SC_MODULE(Testbench) {
    sc_signal<int> a;
    sc_signal<int> b;
    sc_signal<int> lcm_result;

    LcmCalculator *lcm_inst;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Testbench) {
        // Instantiate the LcmCalculator module
        lcm_inst = new LcmCalculator("lcm_inst");

        // Bind the ports
        lcm_inst->a(a);
        lcm_inst->b(b);
        lcm_inst->lcm_result(lcm_result);

        // Initialize input signals
        a.write(15);
        b.write(20);

        // Process to display the LCM result
        SC_METHOD(display_result);
        sensitive << lcm_result;
    }

    // Method to display the LCM result
    void display_result() {
        cout << "LCM of " << a.read() << " and " << b.read() << " is " << lcm_result.read() << endl;
    }
};

// Main simulation function
int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    Testbench tb("tb");

    // Start the simulation
    sc_start();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Testbench Module**: A new `Testbench` module is added to instantiate the `LcmCalculator` module and bind the `lcm_result` port to a specific signal (`lcm_result`).

2. **Binding Ports**: In the constructor of the `Testbench` module, the `a`, `b`, and `lcm_result` ports of the `LcmCalculator` instance are bound to the corresponding signals.

3. **Simulation Setup**: The `sc_start()` function is called to start the simulation.

By ensuring that the `lcm_result` port is properly connected to an external signal in the testbench, the runtime error is resolved, and the simulation should run successfully.
