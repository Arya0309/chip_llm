### Input and Output Analysis

**Inputs:**
- `vector<int>& v`: A reference to a vector of integers representing the sorted array to be searched.
- `int target`: An integer representing the element to search for within the vector.

**Outputs:**
- `bool`: A boolean value indicating whether the target element was found (`true`) or not (`false`).

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Function Declaration and Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   bool binarySearch(vector<int>& v, int target) {
       int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
   ```
   - `binarySearch` function takes a vector `v` and an integer `target` as parameters.
   - It initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, to represent the lower and upper bounds of the search range, respectively. Initially, `low` is set to 0 (the start of the vector), and `high` is set to the last index of the vector.

2. **While Loop for Binary Search:**
   ```cpp
   while (low <= high) {
       int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
       if (v[mid] == target) {
           return true;
       }
       if (v[mid] > target)
           high = mid - 1;
       else
           low = mid + 1;
   }
   ```
   - The `while` loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - Inside the loop, the middle index `mid` is calculated as `((high - low) / 2) + low`.
   - If the element at `mid` is equal to the `target`, the function returns `true`.
   - If the element at `mid` is greater than the `target`, the search range is narrowed to the left half by updating `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - If the element at `mid` is less than the `target`, the search range is narrowed to the right half by updating `low` to `mid + 1`.

3. **Return Statement for Target Not Found:**
   ```cpp
   return false;
   ```
   - If the loop exits without finding the target, the function returns `false`.

4. **Main Function:**
   ```cpp
   int main() {
       vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};
       int target = 8;
       if (binarySearch(v, target)) {
           cout << target << " found.";
       } else {
           cout << target << " NOT found.";
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function initializes a vector `v` and a target value.
   - It calls the `binarySearch` function and prints the result.

### SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinarySearch) {
    sc_in<int> target;  // Input port for the target element
    sc_out<bool> found; // Output port indicating whether the target was found
    sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v; // Input port for the vector elements

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinarySearch) {
        // Process to perform binary search
        SC_METHOD(search);
        sensitive << target;
        for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
            sensitive << v[i];
        }
    }

    // Method to perform binary search
    void search() {
        int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
        bool found_flag = false;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
            if (v[mid].read() == target.read()) {
                found_flag = true;
                break;
            }
            if (v[mid].read() > target.read())
                high = mid - 1;
            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }

        found.write(found_flag);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration:**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(BinarySearch) {
       sc_in<int> target;
       sc_out<bool> found;
       sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v;
   ```
   - The `BinarySearch` module has three ports: `target` (input), `found` (output), and `v` (input vector).

2. **Constructor:**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(BinarySearch) {
       SC_METHOD(search);
       sensitive << target;
       for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
           sensitive << v[i];
       }
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the `search` method as sensitive to changes in `target` and each element of the vector `v`.

3. **Method for Binary Search:**
   ```cpp
   void search() {
       int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
       bool found_flag = false;

       while (low <= high) {
           int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
           if (v[mid].read() == target.read()) {
               found_flag = true;
               break;
           }
           if (v[mid].read() > target.read())
               high = mid - 1;
           else
               low = mid + 1;
       }

       found.write(found_flag);
   }
   ```
   - The `search` method performs the binary search logic similar to the original C++ code.
   - It uses `found_flag` to track whether the target was found.
   - The result is written to the `found` output port.

This SystemC code snippet faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ binary search implementation and can be integrated with the provided signals for testing and verification.
