The error message indicates that the `min` function is not recognized in the current scope. This is because `min` is part of the standard library, and it needs to be prefixed with `std::` to be properly recognized.

To fix this, we need to include the `<algorithm>` header, which contains the declaration of the `std::min` function, and use `std::min` instead of just `min`.

Here is the corrected SystemC code snippet:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>
#include <algorithm> // Include the algorithm header for std::min

// Module to calculate the GcdCalculator of two integers

SC_MODULE(GcdCalculator) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> gcd_result; // Output port for the GcdCalculator result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(GcdCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate GcdCalculator
        SC_METHOD(calculate_gcd);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to calculate the GcdCalculator
    void calculate_gcd() {
        int res = std::min(a.read(), b.read()); // Use std::min instead of min
        while (res > 1) {
            // If any number divide both a and b, so we
            // got the answer
            if (a.read() % res == 0 && b.read() % res == 0)
                break;
            res--;
        }
        gcd_result.write(res); // Write the GcdCalculator result to the output port
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Failure Symptoms**: The compilation failed with an error indicating that `min` was not declared in the current scope. This means that the compiler couldn't find the definition of `min`, which is part of the standard library.

2. **Location of Error**: The error occurred in the line where `min` is called:
   ```cpp
   int res = min(a.read(), b.read()); // Find Minimum of a and b
   ```

3. **Reason for Error**: The `min` function is part of the `std` namespace, and without including the `<algorithm>` header, the compiler doesn't know about it. Additionally, even if the header were included, calling `min` directly would still cause issues because it would be ambiguous whether `min` refers to the global namespace or the `std` namespace.

4. **Proposed Changes**: To fix this, we need to include the `<algorithm>` header to bring `std::min` into scope. We then need to prefix `min` with `std::` to ensure that the correct function is called.

5. **Revised Version of Code Snippet**: The revised code snippet includes the `<algorithm>` header and uses `std::min` to correctly call the minimum function.

6. **Complete, Fixed SystemC Module Code**: The complete, fixed SystemC module code is provided above, which should now compile successfully and work as intended.
