### Analysis of the C++ Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Input**: `n` (an integer)
- **Output**: A boolean indicating whether the input number is an Armstrong number or not.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int n = 153;
   int temp = n;
   int p = 0;
   ```
   - `n` is the input number.
   - `temp` is a copy of `n` to keep the original value for comparison later.
   - `p` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the sum of the cubes of the digits of `n`.

2. **Loop to Calculate the Sum of Cubes**:
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       int rem = n % 10;
       p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
       n = n / 10;
   }
   ```
   - The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - `rem` is the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 (i.e., the last digit of `n`).
   - `p` is updated by adding the cube of `rem`.
   - `n` is then divided by 10 to remove the last digit.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   ```cpp
   if (temp == p) {
       cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
   } else {
       cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
   }
   ```
   - If `temp` (the original number) is equal to `p` (the sum of the cubes of its digits), it prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No."
   - Otherwise, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No."

### SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals (`num_in` and `is_armstrong`). The SystemC code will perform the same logic as the original C++ code but will use SystemC signals for communication.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong;  // Output port indicating if the number is an Armstrong number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        // Process to check if the number is an Armstrong number
        SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is an Armstrong number
    void check_armstrong() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        // Loop to calculate the sum of cubes of individual digits
        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        // Condition to check whether the value of P equals to user input or not
        if (temp == p) {
            is_armstrong.write(true);  // Set output to true if it is an Armstrong number
        } else {
            is_armstrong.write(false);  // Set output to false if it is not an Armstrong number
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `num_in`: An input signal that receives the number to be checked.
  - `is_armstrong`: An output signal that indicates whether the input number is an Armstrong number.

- **Process (`SC_METHOD`)**:
  - The `check_armstrong` method is triggered whenever the `num_in` signal changes.
  - Inside this method, the logic to check if the number is an Armstrong number is implemented, similar to the original C++ code.
  - The result (`true` or `false`) is written to the `is_armstrong` output signal.

This SystemC code snippet is designed to be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow and can be used in conjunction with the provided testbench signals (`num_in` and `is_armstrong`).
