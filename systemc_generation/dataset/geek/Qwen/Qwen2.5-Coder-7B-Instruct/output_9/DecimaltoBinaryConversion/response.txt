### Analysis of the C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The input to the code is a single integer `n`, which is the decimal number to be converted to binary.
- **Outputs**: The output of the code is the binary representation of the input decimal number, printed to the console.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Include Statement and Namespace Declaration**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the standard input-output stream library and uses the standard namespace `std` to avoid prefixing `std::cout` and `std::endl`.

2. **Function Declaration**
   ```cpp
   void decToBinary(int n)
   ```
   - This function takes an integer `n` as input and converts it to a binary number.

3. **Array to Store Binary Number**
   ```cpp
   int binaryNum[32];
   ```
   - An array `binaryNum` of size 32 is declared to store the binary digits. The size 32 is chosen to handle large numbers, though it can be adjusted based on the specific requirements.

4. **Counter for Binary Array**
   ```cpp
   int i = 0;
   ```
   - A counter `i` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the position in the `binaryNum` array.

5. **Loop to Convert Decimal to Binary**
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
       n = n / 2;
       i++;
   }
   ```
   - This loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - In each iteration, the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 (`n % 2`) is stored in `binaryNum[i]`, effectively storing the binary digits.
   - `n` is then updated to `n / 2` to process the next bit.
   - The counter `i` is incremented to move to the next position in the `binaryNum` array.

6. **Loop to Print Binary Number in Reverse Order**
   ```cpp
   for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
       cout << binaryNum[j];
   ```
   - This loop iterates from the last stored binary digit back to the first.
   - It prints each binary digit to the console.

7. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int n = 10;
       decToBinary(n);
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function initializes `n` to 10 and calls the `decToBinary` function with this value.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

To convert the given C++ code to SystemC, we need to use SystemC's signal types and processes. Below is the equivalent SystemC code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinaryConverter) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for the binary number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinaryConverter) {
        // Process to convert decimal to binary
        SC_METHOD(dec_to_binary);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    // Method to convert decimal to binary
    void dec_to_binary() {
        int n = dec_in.read();
        int binaryNum[32];
        int i = 0;

        // Loop to convert decimal to binary
        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }

        // Reset binary_out to 0
        binary_out.write(0);

        // Loop to write binary number to binary_out
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(BinaryConverter) {
   ```
   - This declares a SystemC module named `BinaryConverter`.

2. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for the decimal number
   sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for the binary number
   ```
   - These define the input `dec_in` and output `binary_out` ports.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(BinaryConverter) {
       // Process to convert decimal to binary
       SC_METHOD(dec_to_binary);
       sensitive << dec_in;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the module and sets up a process `dec_to_binary` that is sensitive to changes on `dec_in`.

4. **Method to Convert Decimal to Binary**
   ```cpp
   void dec_to_binary() {
       int n = dec_in.read();
       int binaryNum[32];
       int i = 0;

       // Loop to convert decimal to binary
       while (n > 0) {
           binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
           n = n / 2;
           i++;
       }

       // Reset binary_out to 0
       binary_out.write(0);

       // Loop to write binary number to binary_out
       for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
           binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
       }
   }
   ```
   - This method reads the input `dec_in`, converts it to binary, and writes the binary digits to `binary_out`.
   - The binary digits are written one by one to ensure that the output is updated correctly.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
