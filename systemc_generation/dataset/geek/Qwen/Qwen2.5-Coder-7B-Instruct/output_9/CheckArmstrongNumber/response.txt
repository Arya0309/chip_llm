### Analysis of the Provided C++ Code

**Inputs**:
- `n`: An integer representing the number to be checked if it is an Armstrong number.

**Outputs**:
- Outputs a string indicating whether the number is an Armstrong number or not.

**Code Explanation**:
1. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int n = 153;
   int temp = n;
   int p = 0;
   ```
   - `n` is set to the input number (153 in this case).
   - `temp` is a copy of `n` used later to compare with the calculated sum of cubes.
   - `p` is initialized to 0 and will store the sum of the cubes of the digits of `n`.

2. **Loop to Calculate Sum of Cubes**:
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       int rem = n % 10;
       p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
       n = n / 10;
   }
   ```
   - This loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `rem` stores the last digit of `n` (`n % 10`).
     - `p` is updated by adding the cube of `rem` to it.
     - `n` is then divided by 10 to remove the last digit.

3. **Condition to Check Armstrong Number**:
   ```cpp
   if (temp == p) {
       cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
   } else {
       cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
   }
   ```
   - After the loop, the condition checks if the original number `temp` is equal to `p`.
   - If they are equal, it prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No.".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No.".

### SystemC Code Snippet

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that incorporates the provided signals and faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong; // Output port indicating if the number is an Armstrong number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        // Process to check if the number is an Armstrong number
        SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is an Armstrong number
    void check_armstrong() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        if (temp == p) {
            is_armstrong.write(true);
        } else {
            is_armstrong.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code:
- **Inputs**:
  - `num_in`: The input signal representing the number to be checked.

- **Outputs**:
  - `is_armstrong`: The output signal indicating whether the number is an Armstrong number (`true` if it is, `false` otherwise).

- **Logic**:
  - The `check_armstrong` method reads the input number, calculates the sum of the cubes of its digits, and compares it with the original number.
  - If they are equal, it sets `is_armstrong` to `true`; otherwise, it sets it to `false`.

This SystemC code can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow and tested using the provided signals.
