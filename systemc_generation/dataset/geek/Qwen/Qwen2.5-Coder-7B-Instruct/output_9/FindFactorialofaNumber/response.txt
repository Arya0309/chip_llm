### Input and Output Summary

**Inputs:**
- None (The program does not take any external inputs from the user or other processes.)

**Outputs:**
- The program prints the factorial of a hardcoded number (in this case, 5).

### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Include Statements and Namespace Declaration**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - `#include <iostream>`: Includes the input-output stream library which is necessary for console input and output.
   - `using namespace std;`: Allows us to use standard library names without prefixing them with `std::`.

2. **Function Declaration**
   ```cpp
   unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
   ```
   - Declares a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as input and returns an unsigned integer.

3. **Variable Initialization and Loop**
   ```cpp
   int res = 1, i;
   for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)
       res *= i;
   ```
   - Initializes `res` to 1 (since the factorial of 0 is 1).
   - A loop runs from 2 to `n`, multiplying `res` by each integer in this range to compute the factorial.

4. **Return Statement**
   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```
   - Returns the computed factorial value.

5. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int num = 5;
       cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is "
           << factorial(num) << endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - Declares a variable `num` and initializes it to 5.
   - Calls the `factorial` function with `num` as the argument and prints the result.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

To convert the above C++ code into SystemC, we need to define a module that takes no inputs but has an output. This output will be the factorial of a hardcoded number (5 in this case).

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
    sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
        // Process to compute the factorial
        SC_THREAD(compute_factorial);
    }

    // Thread to compute the factorial
    void compute_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = 5;
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res); // Write the result to the output port
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Include Statements and Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   #include <systemc.h>
   SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
   ```
   - Includes the SystemC library.
   - Defines a SystemC module named `Factorial`.

2. **Output Port Declaration**
   ```cpp
   sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial result
   ```
   - Declares an output port `out` of type `unsigned int`.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
       SC_THREAD(compute_factorial);
   }
   ```
   - Constructor initializes the module and schedules the `compute_factorial` thread to run.

4. **Thread to Compute Factorial**
   ```cpp
   void compute_factorial() {
       unsigned int n = 5;
       unsigned int res = 1;
       for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
           res *= i;
       }
       out.write(res); // Write the result to the output port
   }
   ```
   - Initializes `n` to 5.
   - Initializes `res` to 1.
   - Loops from 2 to `n`, multiplying `res` by each integer in this range to compute the factorial.
   - Writes the computed factorial value to the `out` port.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
