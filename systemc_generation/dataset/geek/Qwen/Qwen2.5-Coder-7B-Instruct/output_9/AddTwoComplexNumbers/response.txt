### Analysis of the Provided C++ Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The C++ code does not take any external inputs from the user. Instead, it uses hardcoded values for the complex numbers.
- **Outputs**: The code prints the real and imaginary parts of the sum of two complex numbers.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Include Libraries and Namespace Declaration**
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes all standard C++ libraries and sets the `std` namespace to avoid prefixing standard library functions with `std::`.

2. **Class Definition**
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - A `Complex` class is defined to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.
   - The constructor initializes the real and imaginary parts.
   - The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects, adds their real and imaginary parts respectively, and returns a new `Complex` object representing the sum.

3. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` are created with hardcoded values.
   - The real and imaginary parts of `C1` and `C2` are printed.
   - A third `Complex` object `C3` is created, and the sum of `C1` and `C2` is calculated and stored in `C3`.
   - The real and imaginary parts of the sum are printed.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

To convert the above C++ code into SystemC, we need to create a module that takes two complex numbers as inputs and outputs their sum. We will use the provided signals (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, `real_sum`, `imag_sum`) to interface with the SystemC testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Define a struct to represent a complex number
struct Complex {
    int real;
    int imaginary;
};

// Module that adds two complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum; // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum; // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        Complex C1 = {real1.read(), imag1.read()};
        Complex C2 = {real2.read(), imag2.read()};
        Complex C3;
        C3.real = C1.real + C2.real;
        C3.imaginary = C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary;
        real_sum.write(C3.real);
        imag_sum.write(C3.imaginary);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Struct Definition**
   ```cpp
   struct Complex {
       int real;
       int imaginary;
   };
   ```
   - A `Complex` struct is defined to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.

2. **Module Definition**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
       sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
       sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
       sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
       sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
       sc_out<int> real_sum; // Output port for the real part of the sum
       sc_out<int> imag_sum; // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum
   ```
   - A `ComplexAdder` module is defined with input and output ports corresponding to the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers and their sum.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
       // Process to perform addition
       SC_METHOD(add);
       sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor sets up a method `add` to be triggered whenever any of the input ports change.

4. **Addition Method**
   ```cpp
   void add() {
       Complex C1 = {real1.read(), imag1.read()};
       Complex C2 = {real2.read(), imag2.read()};
       Complex C3;
       C3.real = C1.real + C2.real;
       C3.imaginary = C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary;
       real_sum.write(C3.real);
       imag_sum.write(C3.imaginary);
   }
   ```
   - The `add` method reads the input ports, performs the addition, and writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
