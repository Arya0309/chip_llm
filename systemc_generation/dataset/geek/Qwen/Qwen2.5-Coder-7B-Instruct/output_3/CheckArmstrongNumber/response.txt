### Analysis of the C++ Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Input**: The integer `n` which is hardcoded to 153 in this case.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the input number is an Armstrong number or not.

#### Detailed Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**
   ```cpp
   int n = 153;
   int temp = n;
   int p = 0;
   ```
   - `n` is initialized to 153, which is the number we are checking.
   - `temp` is assigned the value of `n` to preserve the original number for comparison later.
   - `p` is initialized to 0, which will store the sum of the cubes of the digits of `n`.

2. **Loop to Calculate Sum of Cubes**
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       int rem = n % 10;
       p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
       n = n / 10;
   }
   ```
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `rem` stores the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 (i.e., the last digit of `n`).
     - `p` is updated by adding the cube of `rem` to it.
     - `n` is then divided by 10 to remove the last digit.

3. **Condition to Check Armstrong Number**
   ```cpp
   if (temp == p) {
       cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
   } else {
       cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
   }
   ```
   - The condition checks if `temp` (the original number) is equal to `p` (the sum of the cubes of the digits).
   - If they are equal, it prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No.".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No.".

### SystemC Code Snippet

To convert the given C++ code into a SystemC module, we need to:
- Use `sc_in<int>` for the input signal `num_in`.
- Use `sc_out<bool>` for the output signal `is_armstrong`.
- Implement the logic inside a `SC_METHOD` to handle the computation.

Here is the equivalent SystemC code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input port for the number
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong; // Output port for the result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        // Process to check if the number is an Armstrong number
        SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is an Armstrong number
    void check_armstrong() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        if (temp == p) {
            is_armstrong.write(true);
        } else {
            is_armstrong.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
       sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input port for the number
       sc_out<bool> is_armstrong; // Output port for the result
   ```
   - We define a SystemC module named `ArmstrongChecker`.
   - `num_in` is an input port that takes an integer.
   - `is_armstrong` is an output port that provides a boolean result.

2. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
       SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
       sensitive << num_in;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the module.
   - `check_armstrong` is registered as a method to be called whenever `num_in` changes.

3. **Method to Check Armstrong Number**
   ```cpp
   void check_armstrong() {
       int n = num_in.read();
       int temp = n;
       int p = 0;

       while (n > 0) {
           int rem = n % 10;
           p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
           n = n / 10;
       }

       if (temp == p) {
           is_armstrong.write(true);
       } else {
           is_armstrong.write(false);
       }
   }
   ```
   - This method reads the value from `num_in`.
   - It then follows the same logic as the original C++ code to determine if the number is an Armstrong number.
   - The result is written to `is_armstrong`.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
