### Input and Output Analysis

**Inputs:**
- The input to the C++ program is an integer `n` which represents the decimal number to be converted to binary.

**Outputs:**
- The output of the program is the binary representation of the input decimal number, printed to the console.

### Detailed Explanation of the Code

1. **Include Header Files:**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the standard input-output stream library and uses the standard namespace for convenience.

2. **Function to Convert Decimal to Binary:**
   ```cpp
   void decToBinary(int n)
   ```
   - This function takes an integer `n` as input and converts it to its binary representation.

3. **Array to Store Binary Number:**
   ```cpp
   int binaryNum[32];
   ```
   - An array of size 32 is declared to store the binary digits. The size 32 is chosen to handle large numbers but can be adjusted as needed.

4. **Counter for Binary Array:**
   ```cpp
   int i = 0;
   ```
   - A counter `i` is initialized to zero to keep track of the position in the binary array.

5. **Loop to Convert Decimal to Binary:**
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
       n = n / 2;
       i++;
   }
   ```
   - This loop continues until `n` becomes zero.
   - In each iteration, the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 is stored in the `binaryNum` array at position `i`.
   - `n` is then updated to `n / 2` to process the next bit.
   - The counter `i` is incremented to move to the next position in the array.

6. **Loop to Print Binary Number in Reverse Order:**
   ```cpp
   for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
       cout << binaryNum[j];
   ```
   - This loop iterates from the last valid index of the `binaryNum` array down to zero.
   - Each binary digit is printed to the console.

7. **Driver Code:**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int n = 10;
       decToBinary(n);
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function initializes `n` to 10 and calls the `decToBinary` function to convert and print the binary representation of 10.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

To convert the given C++ code into a SystemC module, we need to:

1. Declare input and output ports.
2. Implement the conversion logic within a method.
3. Use the provided signals (`dec_in` and `binary_out`) for input and output.

Here is the equivalent SystemC code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinaryConverter) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out;  // Output port for the binary number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinaryConverter) {
        // Process to perform the conversion
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    // Method to convert decimal to binary
    void convert() {
        int n = dec_in.read();
        int binaryNum[32];
        int i = 0;

        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }

        int result = 0;
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            result = result * 10 + binaryNum[j];
        }

        binary_out.write(result);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration:**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(BinaryConverter) {
   ```
   - A SystemC module named `BinaryConverter` is declared.

2. **Input and Output Ports:**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for the decimal number
   sc_out<int> binary_out;  // Output port for the binary number
   ```
   - `dec_in` is the input port for the decimal number.
   - `binary_out` is the output port for the binary number.

3. **Constructor:**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(BinaryConverter) {
       // Process to perform the conversion
       SC_METHOD(convert);
       sensitive << dec_in;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor sets up the `convert` method to be sensitive to changes on the `dec_in` port.

4. **Conversion Logic:**
   ```cpp
   void convert() {
       int n = dec_in.read();
       int binaryNum[32];
       int i = 0;

       while (n > 0) {
           binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
           n = n / 2;
           i++;
       }

       int result = 0;
       for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
           result = result * 10 + binaryNum[j];
       }

       binary_out.write(result);
   }
   ```
   - The `convert` method reads the input decimal number.
   - It then follows the same logic as the original C++ code to convert the decimal number to binary and store it in an array.
   - Finally, it constructs the binary number from the array and writes it to the `binary_out` port.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
