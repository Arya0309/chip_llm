### Analysis of the C++ Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: None
- **Outputs**: 
  - `cout`: Prints the factorial of a given number.

#### Detailed Explanation
1. **Include Directive**:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   ```
   This directive includes the standard input-output stream library, which is necessary for using `cout`.

2. **Namespace Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   This line makes the standard library names available without prefixing them with `std::`.

3. **Function Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
   ```
   This function calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer `n`. It returns an `unsigned int` because factorials grow very quickly and can exceed the range of a regular `int`.

4. **Variable Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int res = 1, i;
   ```
   - `res` is initialized to 1 because the factorial of 0 is 1, and it serves as the starting point for multiplication.
   - `i` is used as a loop counter.

5. **Loop to Calculate Factorial**:
   ```cpp
   for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)
       res *= i;
   ```
   - The loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n`.
   - In each iteration, `res` is multiplied by the current value of `i`.

6. **Return Statement**:
   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```
   - The function returns the calculated factorial.

7. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int num = 5;
       cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is "
            << factorial(num) << endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function initializes `num` to 5.
   - It then calls the `factorial` function with `num` as the argument.
   - The result is printed using `cout`.

### SystemC Equivalent Code

To create a SystemC equivalent that integrates with the provided signals (`in` and `out`), we need to define a module that takes an input signal, computes the factorial, and outputs the result.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to compute factorial
SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port for the number
    sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
        // Process to compute factorial
        SC_METHOD(compute_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    // Method to compute the factorial
    void compute_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read();
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code
1. **Include Directive**:
   ```cpp
   #include <systemc.h>
   ```
   This directive includes the SystemC library.

2. **Module Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
   ```
   This defines a SystemC module named `Factorial`.

3. **Input and Output Ports**:
   ```cpp
   sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port for the number
   sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial
   ```
   These lines declare the input and output ports for the module.

4. **Constructor**:
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
       // Process to compute factorial
       SC_METHOD(compute_factorial);
       sensitive << in;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the module.
   - `SC_METHOD(compute_factorial)` declares a method that will be called whenever the input changes.
   - `sensitive << in` specifies that the `compute_factorial` method should be called when the `in` signal changes.

5. **Method to Compute Factorial**:
   ```cpp
   void compute_factorial() {
       unsigned int n = in.read();
       unsigned int res = 1;
       for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
           res *= i;
       }
       out.write(res);
   }
   ```
   - This method reads the input value, computes the factorial, and writes the result to the output port.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
