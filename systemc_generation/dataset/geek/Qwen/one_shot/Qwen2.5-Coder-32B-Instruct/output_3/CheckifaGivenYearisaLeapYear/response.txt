### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input**: An integer `year` which represents the year to be checked.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the given year is a leap year (`true`) or not (`false`).

### Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation:
1. **Include Directive**: 
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   ```
   This includes the standard input-output stream library, which is used for displaying output in the console.

2. **Namespace Usage**:
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   This line allows us to use standard library names without prefixing them with `std::`.

3. **Function Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   bool checkYear(int year)
   ```
   This declares a function named `checkYear` that takes an integer `year` as input and returns a boolean value.

4. **First Condition**:
   ```cpp
   if (year % 400 == 0) {
       return true;
   }
   ```
   If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year. This is the first condition checked in the function.

5. **Second Condition**:
   ```cpp
   else if (year % 100 == 0) {
       return false;
   }
   ```
   If the year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is not a leap year. This condition is checked after the first one.

6. **Third Condition**:
   ```cpp
   else if (year % 4 == 0) {
       return true;
   }
   ```
   If the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it is a leap year. This condition is checked after the previous ones.

7. **Final Condition**:
   ```cpp
   else {
       return false;
   }
   ```
   If none of the above conditions are met, the year is not a leap year.

8. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
   int main()
   ```
   This is the entry point of the program.

9. **Variable Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   int year = 2000;
   ```
   An integer variable `year` is declared and initialized to 2000.

10. **Function Call and Output**:
    ```cpp
    checkYear(year) ? cout << "Leap Year" : cout << "Not a Leap Year";
    ```
    The `checkYear` function is called with `year` as the argument. Depending on the result, either "Leap Year" or "Not a Leap Year" is printed to the console.

11. **Return Statement**:
    ```cpp
    return 0;
    ```
    The main function returns 0, indicating successful execution.

### Equivalent SystemC Code:
Below is the SystemC equivalent of the provided C++/C code. It uses the specified `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<bool>` signals for seamless integration with the existing testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to check if a given year is a leap year
SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    sc_in<int> year;          // Input port for the year
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year; // Output port for the leap year check result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
        // Process to check if the year is a leap year
        SC_METHOD(check_leap_year);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    // Method to determine if the year is a leap year
    void check_leap_year() {
        int current_year = year.read();
        bool leap = false;

        if (current_year % 400 == 0) {
            leap = true;
        } else if (current_year % 100 == 0) {
            leap = false;
        } else if (current_year % 4 == 0) {
            leap = true;
        } else {
            leap = false;
        }

        is_leap_year.write(leap);
    }
};

```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **Module Declaration**: The module `LeapYearChecker` encapsulates the logic for checking leap years.
- **Ports**: 
  - `sc_in<int> year`: This is the input port for the year to be checked.
  - `sc_out<bool> is_leap_year`: This is the output port that provides the result of the leap year check.
- **Constructor**: 
  - The constructor initializes the module and specifies that the `check_leap_year` method should be triggered whenever the `year` input changes.
- **Method `check_leap_year`**:
  - Reads the value from the `year` input port.
  - Implements the same leap year logic as the C++/C code.
  - Writes the result (`true` or `false`) to the `is_leap_year` output port.

This SystemC module can now be integrated into a larger system or testbench using the provided input and output signals.
