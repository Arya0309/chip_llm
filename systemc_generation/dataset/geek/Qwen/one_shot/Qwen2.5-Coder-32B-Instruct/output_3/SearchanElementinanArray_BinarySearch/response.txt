### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs:**
  - `vector<int>& v`: A sorted vector of integers where the binary search will be performed.
  - `int target`: The integer value to be searched within the vector.
- **Outputs:**
  - `bool`: Returns `true` if the target is found in the vector, otherwise returns `false`.

### Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation
1. **Function Definition:**
   ```cpp
   bool binarySearch(vector<int>& v, int target) {
   ```
   - Defines a function named `binarySearch` which takes a reference to a vector of integers `v` and an integer `target` as parameters. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the target is found in the vector.

2. **Initialization of Search Range:**
   ```cpp
   int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
   ```
   - Initializes two integer variables, `low` and `high`, to represent the current range of indices being searched within the vector. Initially, `low` is set to 0 (the start of the vector), and `high` is set to the last index of the vector (`v.size() - 1`).

3. **Binary Search Loop:**
   ```cpp
   while (low <= high) {
   ```
   - Begins a while loop that continues as long as the `low` index is less than or equal to the `high` index. This loop narrows down the search range until the target is found or the range becomes invalid.

4. **Finding Midpoint:**
   ```cpp
   int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
   ```
   - Calculates the midpoint index `mid` of the current search range using the formula `((high - low) / 2) + low`. This avoids potential overflow issues that could occur with `(low + high) / 2`.

5. **Check Middle Element:**
   ```cpp
   if (v[mid] == target) {
       return true;
   }
   ```
   - Checks if the middle element of the current search range (`v[mid]`) is equal to the target. If they are equal, the function returns `true`, indicating that the target has been found.

6. **Adjust Search Range Based on Comparison:**
   ```cpp
   if (v[mid] > target)
       high = mid - 1;
   else
       low = mid + 1;
   ```
   - If the middle element is greater than the target, the search range is adjusted to the left half by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - If the middle element is less than the target, the search range is adjusted to the right half by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.

7. **Target Not Found:**
   ```cpp
   return false;
   ```
   - If the loop exits without finding the target, the function returns `false`, indicating that the target is not present in the vector.

8. **Main Function:**
   ```cpp
   int main() {
       vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};
       int target = 8;
       if (binarySearch(v, target)) {
           cout << target << " found.";
       } else {
           cout << target << " NOT found.";
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - Initializes a sorted vector `v` and sets the `target` to 8.
   - Calls the `binarySearch` function with the vector and target as arguments.
   - Prints whether the target was found or not based on the result of the `binarySearch` function.

### Equivalent SystemC Code
Below is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that performs binary search
SC_MODULE(BinarySearchModule) {
    sc_in<int> target;  // Input port for the target value
    sc_out<bool> found; // Output port to indicate if target is found
    sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v; // Input ports for the vector elements

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinarySearchModule) : v("v", 8) { // Assuming the vector size is 8
        // Process to perform binary search
        SC_METHOD(binary_search);
        sensitive << target;
        for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
            sensitive << v[i];
        }
    }

    // Method to perform binary search
    void binary_search() {
        int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
        bool result = false;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
            if (v[mid].read() == target.read()) {
                result = true;
                break;
            }
            if (v[mid].read() > target.read())
                high = mid - 1;
            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }

        found.write(result);
    }
};

```

### Explanation of SystemC Code
- **Module Definition:** `BinarySearchModule` is a SystemC module that encapsulates the binary search logic.
- **Signals:**
  - `sc_in<int> target`: Input signal representing the target value to be searched.
  - `sc_out<bool> found`: Output signal indicating whether the target is found in the vector.
  - `sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v`: A vector of input signals representing the elements of the sorted vector. The size is assumed to be 8 as per the example vector in the original code.
- **Constructor:**
  - Initializes the vector `v` with a size of 8.
  - Sensitivity list includes the `target` signal and all elements of the `v` vector to ensure the method `binary_search` is triggered whenever any of these change.
- **Method `binary_search`:**
  - Implements the binary search logic similar to the C++/C function.
  - Reads the values from the input signals using `.read()` and writes the result to the `found` output signal.

This SystemC module can now be integrated into a larger SystemC design and tested using the provided signals.
