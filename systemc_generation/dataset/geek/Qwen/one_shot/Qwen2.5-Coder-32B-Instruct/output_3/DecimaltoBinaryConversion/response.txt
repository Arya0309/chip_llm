### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input:** An integer `n` which is the decimal number to be converted to binary.
- **Output:** The binary representation of the integer `n` printed to the console.

### Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation:

1. **Function Declaration:**
   ```cpp
   void decToBinary(int n)
   ```
   - This function takes an integer `n` as input and converts it to its binary representation.

2. **Array Declaration:**
   ```cpp
   int binaryNum[32];
   ```
   - An array `binaryNum` of size 32 is declared to store the binary digits (bits) of the number. The size 32 is chosen to accommodate the maximum number of bits needed for a 32-bit integer.

3. **Counter Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   int i = 0;
   ```
   - A counter `i` is initialized to zero. This counter is used to index into the `binaryNum` array.

4. **While Loop:**
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
       n = n / 2;
       i++;
   }
   ```
   - This loop continues until `n` becomes zero.
   - Inside the loop, the remainder of `n` divided by 2 (`n % 2`) is stored in the `binaryNum` array at the current index `i`. This operation extracts the least significant bit of `n`.
   - `n` is then updated by dividing it by 2 (`n = n / 2`), effectively removing the least significant bit.
   - The counter `i` is incremented to move to the next position in the array.

5. **Printing Binary Number:**
   ```cpp
   for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
       cout << binaryNum[j];
   ```
   - This loop iterates over the `binaryNum` array from the last filled position to the first.
   - It prints each bit in reverse order to produce the correct binary representation of the number.

6. **Main Function:**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int n = 10;
       decToBinary(n);
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function initializes an integer `n` with the value 10.
   - It calls the `decToBinary` function to convert this decimal number to binary and print it.
   - The program returns 0 indicating successful execution.

### Equivalent SystemC Code Snippet:

Below is the SystemC module that replicates the functionality of the provided C++/C code. It includes the necessary signals (`sc_in` and `sc_out`) for seamless integration with the existing testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to convert decimal to binary
SC_MODULE(DecToBinConverter) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;       // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out;  // Output port for the binary number (as an integer)

    // Internal storage for binary representation
    int binaryNum[32];

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DecToBinConverter) {
        // Process to perform conversion
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    // Method to convert decimal to binary
    void convert() {
        int n = dec_in.read();
        int i = 0;

        // Convert decimal to binary
        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }

        // Construct binary number as an integer
        int binary_output = 0;
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            binary_output = (binary_output << 1) | binaryNum[j];
        }

        // Write the binary result to the output port
        binary_out.write(binary_output);
    }
};

// Example usage
int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    sc_signal<int> dec_in;      // Signal for decimal input
    sc_signal<int> binary_out;  // Signal for binary output

    // Instantiate the converter module
    DecToBinConverter converter("converter");
    converter.dec_in(dec_in);
    converter.binary_out(binary_out);

    // Test the converter
    sc_start();
    dec_in.write(10);  // Input decimal number 10
    sc_start();        // Run the simulation

    // Print the binary output
    cout << "Decimal: 10 -> Binary: " << binary_out.read() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **Module Declaration:**
  - `DecToBinConverter` is a SystemC module that performs the conversion from decimal to binary.
  
- **Signals:**
  - `dec_in`: Input signal for the decimal number to be converted.
  - `binary_out`: Output signal for the resulting binary number represented as an integer.

- **Internal Storage:**
  - `binaryNum`: An array to store the binary digits of the number.

- **Constructor:**
  - The constructor registers the `convert` method to be triggered whenever there is a change in the `dec_in` signal.

- **Conversion Method:**
  - The `convert` method reads the decimal number from `dec_in`.
  - It converts the decimal number to binary using the same logic as the original C++/C code.
  - The binary digits are then combined into a single integer (`binary_output`) which is written to the `binary_out` signal.

- **Testbench:**
  - The `sc_main` function sets up the testbench environment.
  - It instantiates the `DecToBinConverter` module and connects the input and output signals.
  - It writes a test value to `dec_in`, runs the simulation, and prints the binary result from `binary_out`.

This SystemC module can be integrated into larger designs and used in high-level synthesis flows, maintaining the same functionality as the original C++/C code.
