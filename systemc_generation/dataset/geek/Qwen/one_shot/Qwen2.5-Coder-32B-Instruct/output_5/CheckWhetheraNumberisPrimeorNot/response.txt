### Inputs and Outputs
- **Input**: The integer `n` which is checked for primality.
- **Output**: A message indicating whether the number `n` is prime or not.

### Line-by-Line Explanation
1. **#include <bits/stdc++.h>**
   - This includes all standard C++ libraries. However, in practice, only necessary headers should be included for better performance and maintainability.
   
2. **using namespace std;**
   - This allows the use of standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.

3. **int main() {**
   - The main function where execution starts.

4. **int n = 29;**
   - Declares an integer variable `n` and initializes it to 29. This is the number to be checked for primality.

5. **int cnt = 0;**
   - Declares an integer variable `cnt` and initializes it to 0. This variable counts the number of divisors of `n`.

6. **if (n <= 1)**
   - Checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.

7. **cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;**
   - Prints a message indicating that `n` is not prime.

8. **else {**
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program proceeds to check for divisors.

9. **for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {**
   - Loops through all numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive to check for divisors.

10. **if (n % i == 0)**
    - Checks if `i` is a divisor of `n` by seeing if the remainder when `n` is divided by `i` is zero.

11. **cnt++;**
    - Increments the counter `cnt` for each divisor found.

12. **if (cnt > 2)**
    - Checks if `n` has more than 2 divisors. If true, `n` is not prime.

13. **cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;**
    - Prints a message indicating that `n` is not prime.

14. **else**
    - If `n` has exactly 2 divisors, it is prime.

15. **cout << n << " is prime" << endl;**
    - Prints a message indicating that `n` is prime.

16. **return 0;**
    - Ends the main function and returns 0 indicating successful execution.

### SystemC Equivalent Code

Below is the SystemC code that replicates the functionality of the provided C++ code using the specified `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<bool>` signals.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to check if a number is prime
SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n;         // Input port for the number to be checked
    sc_out<bool> is_prime; // Output port indicating if the number is prime

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        // Process to check for primality
        SC_METHOD(check_prime);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is prime
    void check_prime() {
        int cnt = 0;
        int num = n.read();

        // If number is less than/equal to 1, it is not prime
        if (num <= 1) {
            is_prime.write(false);
            return;
        }

        // Check for divisors from 1 to num
        for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
            // Check how many numbers divide num
            if (num % i == 0) {
                cnt++;
            }
        }

        // If num is divisible by more than 2 numbers, then it is not prime
        if (cnt > 2) {
            is_prime.write(false);
        } else {
            // Otherwise, it is prime
            is_prime.write(true);
        }
    }
};

```

### Explanation of SystemC Code
- **sc_in<int> n;** and **sc_out<bool> is_prime;**
  - These define the input and output ports for the module. `n` takes an integer input, and `is_prime` provides a boolean output indicating primality.

- **SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker)**
  - The constructor registers the `check_prime` method to be triggered whenever the value of `n` changes.

- **void check_prime()**
  - This method implements the logic to determine if the number `n` is prime.
  - It initializes a counter `cnt` to count the divisors.
  - It checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1 and sets `is_prime` to false if true.
  - It iterates from 1 to `n`, incrementing `cnt` for each divisor.
  - If `cnt` is greater than 2, it sets `is_prime` to false, otherwise true.

This SystemC module can now be integrated into a larger design and tested using the provided testbench signals.
