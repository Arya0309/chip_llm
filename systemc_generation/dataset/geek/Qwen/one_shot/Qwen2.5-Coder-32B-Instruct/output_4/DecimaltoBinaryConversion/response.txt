### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input**: An integer `n` which is the decimal number to be converted to binary.
- **Output**: The binary representation of the decimal number printed to the console.

### Detailed Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation:

1. **Include Directives and Namespace Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the standard input-output stream library, allowing the use of `cout`.
   - The `using namespace std;` directive allows us to use standard library names without prefixing them with `std::`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   void decToBinary(int n)
   ```
   - This function takes an integer `n` as input and converts it to its binary representation.

3. **Array Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   int binaryNum[32];
   ```
   - An array `binaryNum` of size 32 is declared to store the binary digits of the input number.

4. **Counter Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int i = 0;
   ```
   - A counter `i` is initialized to zero. This counter will keep track of the current position in the `binaryNum` array.

5. **Conversion Loop**:
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
       n = n / 2;
       i++;
   }
   ```
   - This loop continues until `n` becomes zero.
   - Inside the loop, `n % 2` calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 2, which is the least significant bit of the binary representation. This value is stored in the `binaryNum` array at index `i`.
   - `n = n / 2` divides `n` by 2, effectively removing the least significant bit.
   - `i++` increments the counter to point to the next position in the array.

6. **Printing Binary Representation**:
   ```cpp
   for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
       cout << binaryNum[j];
   ```
   - This loop iterates over the `binaryNum` array from the last filled position (`i - 1`) to the first (`0`), printing each element. This is necessary because the binary digits were stored in reverse order during the conversion process.

7. **Driver Code**:
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int n = 10;
       decToBinary(n);
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function initializes `n` to 10 and calls the `decToBinary` function to print its binary representation.
   - The program then returns 0, indicating successful execution.

### Equivalent SystemC Code Snippet

Below is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that performs the same decimal-to-binary conversion using the provided signals `dec_in` and `binary_out`. The SystemC module reads a decimal number from `dec_in`, performs the conversion, and writes the resulting binary number to `binary_out`.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DecToBinConverter) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;     // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for the binary number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DecToBinConverter) {
        // Process to convert decimal to binary
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    // Method to perform the conversion
    void convert() {
        int n = dec_in.read();
        int binaryNum[32];
        int i = 0;

        // Conversion loop
        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }

        // Calculate the binary number as an integer
        int binary_result = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            binary_result = (binary_result << 1) | binaryNum[j];
        }

        // Write the result to the output port
        binary_out.write(binary_result);
    }
};

// Example top-level module for simulation
SC_MODULE(TopLevel) {
    DecToBinConverter converter;
    sc_signal<int> dec_in;
    sc_signal<int> binary_out;

    SC_CTOR(TopLevel) : converter("converter") {
        converter.dec_in(dec_in);
        converter.binary_out(binary_out);

        // Initialize and start the simulation
        SC_THREAD(testbench);
    }

    void testbench() {
        // Test case
        dec_in.write(10);
        wait(10, SC_NS); // Wait for some time to observe the output

        // Print the result
        cout << "Decimal: " << dec_in.read() << ", Binary: " << binary_out.read() << endl;

        // End the simulation
        sc_stop();
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    TopLevel top("top");
    sc_start(); // Start the simulation
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **Module Definition**:
  - `DecToBinConverter` is a SystemC module that includes two ports: `dec_in` for receiving the decimal number and `binary_out` for sending the binary result.
  
- **Constructor**:
  - The constructor registers the `convert` method to be triggered whenever `dec_in` changes.

- **Conversion Logic**:
  - The `convert` method reads the decimal number from `dec_in`, performs the conversion to binary, and writes the binary number to `binary_out`.
  - The binary number is constructed as an integer by shifting and combining the binary digits stored in `binaryNum`.

- **Top-Level Module**:
  - `TopLevel` is a simple module to simulate the `DecToBinConverter` module.
  - It includes a `testbench` thread that writes a test value to `dec_in`, waits for a short period, and prints the converted binary value from `binary_out`.

This SystemC code is designed to be integrated into a larger simulation environment, where it can interact with other modules through the defined ports.
