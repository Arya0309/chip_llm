### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Inputs**: The program takes three integer values `a`, `b`, and `c` as inputs.
- **Outputs**: The program outputs the largest of the three integers.

### Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation:
1. **Include Directive**: `#include <iostream>` includes the standard input-output stream library which is used for input and output operations.
2. **Namespace Declaration**: `using namespace std;` allows us to use standard library names without prefixing them with `std::`.
3. **Main Function**: `int main()` is the entry point of the C++ program.
4. **Variable Declarations**: `int a = 1, b = 2, c = 11;` initializes three integer variables with specific values.
5. **First If Condition**: `if (a >= b)` checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
6. **Nested If Condition**: `if (a >= c)` checks if `a` is also greater than or equal to `c`. If both conditions are true, `a` is the largest, and it prints `a`.
7. **Else Block**: `else cout << c;` executes if `a` is not greater than or equal to `c`, meaning `c` is larger than `a` but we already know `b` is less than `a`, thus `c` is the largest.
8. **Else Block for Outer If**: `else` handles the case where `a` is not greater than or equal to `b`.
9. **Second Nested If Condition**: `if (b >= c)` checks if `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If true, `b` is the largest, and it prints `b`.
10. **Final Else Block**: `else cout << c;` executes if `b` is not greater than or equal to `c`, meaning `c` is the largest.
11. **Return Statement**: `return 0;` indicates successful execution of the program.

### SystemC Code Generation:
Below is the SystemC code that replicates the logic of finding the largest among three numbers using the provided signals.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to find the largest among three numbers
SC_MODULE(FindLargest) {
    sc_in<int> a;      // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;      // Input port for the second number
    sc_in<int> c;      // Input port for the third number
    sc_out<int> largest; // Output port for the largest number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(FindLargest) {
        // Process to determine the largest number
        SC_METHOD(find_largest);
        sensitive << a << b << c;
    }

    // Method to find the largest number
    void find_largest() {
        int result;
        if (a.read() >= b.read()) {
            if (a.read() >= c.read())
                result = a.read();
            else
                result = c.read();
        } else {
            if (b.read() >= c.read())
                result = b.read();
            else
                result = c.read();
        }
        largest.write(result);
    }
};

```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code:
- **Module Declaration**: `SC_MODULE(FindLargest)` declares a new SystemC module named `FindLargest`.
- **Signal Ports**: Three input ports (`a`, `b`, `c`) and one output port (`largest`) are declared to handle the inputs and output.
- **Constructor**: `SC_CTOR(FindLargest)` is the constructor of the module, where we define the process `find_largest` and specify its sensitivity to changes in `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- **Method Definition**: `void find_largest()` is the method that contains the logic to determine the largest number among the three inputs. It reads the values from the input ports, performs the comparison logic similar to the C++ code, and writes the result to the `largest` output port.

This SystemC module can now be integrated into a testbench using the provided signals for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `largest`.
