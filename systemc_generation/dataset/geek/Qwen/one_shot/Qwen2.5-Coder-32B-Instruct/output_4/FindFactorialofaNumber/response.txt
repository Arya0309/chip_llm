### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input**: An unsigned integer `n` for which the factorial is to be calculated. In this specific example, the number is hardcoded as `5`.
- **Output**: The factorial of the input number, which is printed to the console.

### Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation:

1. **Header and Namespace:**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - Includes the standard input-output stream library, allowing the use of `cout` for printing to the console.
   - Uses the standard namespace to avoid prefixing standard library functions with `std::`.

2. **Factorial Function Definition:**
   ```cpp
   unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
   {
       int res = 1, i;
       for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)
           res *= i;
       return res;
   }
   ```
   - Defines a function `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as input and returns an unsigned integer.
   - Initializes `res` to `1`, which will hold the result of the factorial calculation.
   - A `for` loop runs from `2` to `n`, multiplying `res` by each integer `i` in this range.
   - Returns the computed factorial value stored in `res`.

3. **Main Function:**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int num = 5;
       cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is "
            << factorial(num) << endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - Declares an integer `num` and initializes it to `5`.
   - Prints the string "Factorial of 5 is " followed by the result of calling `factorial(num)`.
   - Ends the program by returning `0`.

### Equivalent SystemC Code:
Below is the equivalent SystemC code that implements the factorial calculation and uses the provided `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals for integration with a testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates the factorial of a number
SC_MODULE(FactorialCalculator) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port for the number
    sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(FactorialCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate factorial
        SC_METHOD(calculate_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    // Method to calculate the factorial
    void calculate_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read();
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }
};

// Example top module for simulation
SC_MODULE(TopModule) {
    FactorialCalculator fc;
    sc_signal<unsigned int> num;
    sc_signal<unsigned int> result;

    SC_CTOR(TopModule) : fc("fc") {
        fc.in(num);
        fc.out(result);

        // Initialize the input signal
        num.write(5); // Set the input number to 5

        // Process to print the result
        SC_METHOD(print_result);
        sensitive << result;
    }

    void print_result() {
        cout << "Factorial of " << num.read() << " is " << result.read() << endl;
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    TopModule top("top");
    sc_start();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code:
- **FactorialCalculator Module**: This module contains the logic to compute the factorial of a number. It has an input port `in` and an output port `out`.
  - The constructor sets up a method `calculate_factorial` that is triggered whenever the input changes.
  - The `calculate_factorial` method reads the input number, computes its factorial using a loop, and writes the result to the output port.

- **TopModule**: This module instantiates the `FactorialCalculator` and connects it to signals. It also includes a process to print the result once it's available.
  - The `TopModule` initializes the input signal `num` to `5` and connects it to the `FactorialCalculator`'s input port.
  - The `print_result` method is triggered when the output signal `result` changes, printing the factorial result to the console.

This SystemC code snippet is designed to work within a high-level synthesis flow and can be integrated into an existing testbench using the specified `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals.
