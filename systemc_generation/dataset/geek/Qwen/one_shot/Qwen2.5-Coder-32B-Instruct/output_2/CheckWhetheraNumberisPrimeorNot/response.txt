### Inputs and Outputs
- **Input**: An integer `n` which represents the number to be checked for primality.
- **Output**: A message indicating whether the number is prime or not.

### Line-by-Line Explanation
1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This includes all standard C++ libraries.
2. `using namespace std;`: This allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.
3. `int main() {`: This is the main function where the execution starts.
4. `int n = 29;`: The variable `n` is initialized with the value 29. In this context, `n` is the number we want to check for primality.
5. `int cnt = 0;`: A counter variable `cnt` is initialized to 0. This will count how many divisors `n` has.
6. `if (n <= 1)`: Checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
7. `cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;`: If `n` is less than or equal to 1, this line prints that `n` is not prime.
8. `else {`: If `n` is greater than 1, the program enters this block.
9. `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {`: A loop runs from 1 to `n`. For each iteration, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n`.
10. `if (n % i == 0)`: Checks if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i` equals 0).
11. `cnt++;`: If `n` is divisible by `i`, increment the counter `cnt`.
12. `}`: Ends the for loop.
13. `if (cnt > 2)`: After the loop, checks if `cnt` is greater than 2. A prime number should have exactly two divisors: 1 and itself.
14. `cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;`: If `cnt` is greater than 2, `n` is not prime, and this line prints that.
15. `else`: If `cnt` is not greater than 2, `n` is prime.
16. `cout << n << " is prime" << endl;`: Prints that `n` is prime.
17. `}`: Ends the else block.
18. `return 0;`: Returns 0 indicating successful completion of the program.
19. `}`: Ends the main function.

### SystemC Equivalent Code

Below is the SystemC equivalent code that captures the same logic and uses the provided signals for integration with a testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to check if a number is prime
SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n;          // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_prime;  // Output port indicating if the number is prime

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        // Process to check for primality
        SC_METHOD(check_prime);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is prime
    void check_prime() {
        int cnt = 0;
        int num = n.read();

        // If number is less than/equal to 1, it is not prime
        if (num <= 1) {
            is_prime.write(false);
            return;
        }

        // Check for divisors from 1 to num
        for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
            // Check how many numbers divide num
            if (num % i == 0)
                cnt++;
        }

        // If num is divisible by more than 2 numbers, then it is not prime
        if (cnt > 2)
            is_prime.write(false);
        else
            is_prime.write(true);
    }
};

```

### Explanation of SystemC Code
- **Module Declaration**: The module `PrimeChecker` is declared with input and output ports.
- **Constructor**: The constructor initializes the process `check_prime` and sets sensitivity to changes in the input `n`.
- **Method `check_prime`**: This method contains the logic to determine if the number is prime.
  - It reads the input `n` into the local variable `num`.
  - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
  - It checks if `num` is less than or equal to 1 and writes `false` to `is_prime` if true.
  - It iterates from 1 to `num`, counting how many numbers divide `num`.
  - It checks if `cnt` is greater than 2 to determine if `num` is not prime and writes the appropriate boolean value to `is_prime`.

This SystemC code can be integrated into a larger design and tested using the provided testbench signals.
