### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Two integers `a` and `b`.
- **Outputs**: The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation
1. **Include Directives**: The program includes the standard I/O stream library to allow for input and output operations.
2. **Namespace Declaration**: The `std` namespace is used to avoid prefixing standard library functions with `std::`.
3. **Main Function**: The `main()` function serves as the entry point of the program.
4. **Variable Declarations**: 
   - `a` and `b` are initialized to 15 and 20 respectively.
   - `max_num` is declared to hold the larger of the two numbers.
   - `flag` is used as a control variable for the while loop.
5. **Ternary Operator**: The ternary operator `(a > b) ? a : b` determines which of the two numbers (`a` or `b`) is larger and assigns this value to `max_num`.
6. **While Loop**: The loop continues until `flag` becomes false (which happens when the LCM is found).
7. **If Condition**: Inside the loop, the condition checks if `max_num` is divisible by both `a` and `b`. If true, it prints the LCM and breaks out of the loop.
8. **Increment Statement**: If the condition is not met, `max_num` is incremented by 1 and the loop repeats.
9. **Return Statement**: The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

### SystemC Equivalent Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that performs the same functionality as the provided C++/C code. It uses the specified input and output signals for seamless integration with the existing testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to calculate the LCM of two integers
SC_MODULE(LCMCalculator) {
    sc_in<int> a;          // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;          // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> lcm_result; // Output port for the LCM

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LCMCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate the LCM
        SC_METHOD(calculate_lcm);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to calculate the LCM
    void calculate_lcm() {
        int a_val = a.read();
        int b_val = b.read();
        int max_num = (a_val > b_val) ? a_val : b_val;
        bool flag = true;

        while (flag) {
            // Check if max_num is divisible by both a and b
            if (max_num % a_val == 0 && max_num % b_val == 0) {
                lcm_result.write(max_num);
                flag = false; // Exit the loop after finding the LCM
            } else {
                ++max_num; // Increment max_num and check again
            }
        }
    }
};

```

### Explanation of SystemC Code
- **Module Definition**: The `LCMCalculator` module encapsulates the logic for calculating the LCM of two integers.
- **Input and Output Ports**: The module has two input ports `a` and `b` and one output port `lcm_result`.
- **Constructor**: The constructor registers the `calculate_lcm` method as a sensitive process that triggers whenever `a` or `b` changes.
- **Method Implementation**: The `calculate_lcm` method reads the values from the input ports, calculates the LCM using a similar approach to the original C++ code, and writes the result to the `lcm_result` output port once the LCM is found.

This SystemC module can now be integrated into a larger SystemC design and tested using the provided testbench signals.
