### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `principal`: The initial amount of money (principal amount).
  - `rate`: The annual interest rate (in percentage).
  - `time`: The time period for which the interest is calculated (in years).
- **Outputs**:
  - `CI`: The compound interest calculated using the formula \( CI = P \times (1 + \frac{R}{100})^T - P \).

### Detailed Explanation
1. **Variable Declarations**:
   ```cpp
   double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;
   ```
   - Here, three variables `principal`, `rate`, and `time` are declared and initialized with values `10000`, `5`, and `2` respectively. These represent the principal amount, annual interest rate, and time period in years.

2. **Compound Interest Calculation**:
   ```cpp
   double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));
   double CI = A - principal;
   ```
   - The compound amount `A` is calculated using the formula \( A = P \times (1 + \frac{R}{100})^T \). 
   - The compound interest `CI` is then derived by subtracting the principal from the compound amount: \( CI = A - P \).

3. **Output Display**:
   ```cpp
   cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;
   ```
   - The calculated compound interest `CI` is printed to the console.

### SystemC Code Generation

Below is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that captures the logic of the provided C++/C code. It uses the specified signals for integration with the existing testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to calculate compound interest
SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
    sc_in<double> principal;  // Input port for the principal amount
    sc_in<double> rate;       // Input port for the interest rate
    sc_in<double> time;       // Input port for the time period
    sc_out<double> ci;        // Output port for the compound interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate compound interest
        SC_METHOD(calculateCompoundInterest);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculateCompoundInterest() {
        double P = principal.read();
        double R = rate.read();
        double T = time.read();

        // Calculate compound amount A
        double A = P * (pow((1 + R / 100), T));
        // Calculate compound interest CI
        double CI = A - P;

        // Write the result to the output port
        ci.write(CI);
    }
};

// Example usage in a simple testbench
int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // Create instances of signals
    sc_signal<double> principal_sig;
    sc_signal<double> rate_sig;
    sc_signal<double> time_sig;
    sc_signal<double> ci_sig;

    // Create instance of the CompoundInterestCalculator module
    CompoundInterestCalculator cic("CompoundInterestCalculator");
    cic.principal(principal_sig);
    cic.rate(rate_sig);
    cic.time(time_sig);
    cic.ci(ci_sig);

    // Initialize signals
    principal_sig = 10000;
    rate_sig = 5;
    time_sig = 2;

    // Run the simulation for one delta cycle
    sc_start(1, SC_NS);

    // Print the result
    cout << "Compound interest is " << ci_sig.read() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code
- **Module Declaration**:
  - `CompoundInterestCalculator` is a SystemC module that takes three input signals (`principal`, `rate`, `time`) and one output signal (`ci`).
  
- **Constructor**:
  - The constructor initializes a method `calculateCompoundInterest` which is sensitive to changes in any of the input signals.
  
- **Method `calculateCompoundInterest`**:
  - Reads the values from the input signals.
  - Calculates the compound amount `A` using the formula \( A = P \times (1 + \frac{R}{100})^T \).
  - Computes the compound interest `CI` as \( CI = A - P \).
  - Writes the result to the output signal `ci`.
  
- **Testbench**:
  - An example testbench initializes the input signals with values similar to the original C++ code.
  - Runs the simulation for one delta cycle to allow the process to execute.
  - Prints the calculated compound interest.
