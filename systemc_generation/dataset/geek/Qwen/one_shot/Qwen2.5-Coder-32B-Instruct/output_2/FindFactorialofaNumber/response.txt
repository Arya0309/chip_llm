### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input**: An unsigned integer `n` which represents the number for which the factorial is to be calculated.
- **Output**: The factorial of the input number `n`.

### Detailed Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation:

1. **Include Directive**: 
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   ```
   This line includes the standard input-output stream library which is necessary for printing output to the console.

2. **Namespace Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   This line allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.

3. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
   ```
   This line declares a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as an argument and returns an unsigned integer.

4. **Variable Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int res = 1, i;
   ```
   Two variables are declared: `res` initialized to 1 (to hold the result of the factorial), and `i` which will be used as a loop counter.

5. **For Loop**:
   ```cpp
   for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)
       res *= i;
   ```
   A `for` loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n`, multiplying `res` by each value of `i` in each iteration. This effectively calculates the factorial of `n`.

6. **Return Statement**:
   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```
   The function returns the computed factorial value stored in `res`.

7. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
   int main()
   ```
   The `main` function serves as the entry point of the program.

8. **Variable Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   int num = 5;
   ```
   An integer variable `num` is declared and initialized to 5. This is the number whose factorial is to be calculated.

9. **Output Statement**:
   ```cpp
   cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;
   ```
   This line prints the factorial of `num` to the console by calling the `factorial` function.

10. **Return Statement**:
    ```cpp
    return 0;
    ```
    The `main` function returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program.

### Equivalent SystemC Code:

Below is the SystemC code that replicates the logic of the provided C++/C code. It uses the `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals as specified.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to calculate factorial
SC_MODULE(FactorialCalculator) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port for the number
    sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(FactorialCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate factorial
        SC_METHOD(calculate_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    // Method to calculate the factorial
    void calculate_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read();
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }
};

// Example testbench
SC_MODULE(Testbench) {
    sc_signal<unsigned int> num;
    sc_signal<unsigned int> result;

    FactorialCalculator calc;

    SC_CTOR(Testbench) : calc("calc") {
        calc.in(num);
        calc.out(result);

        // Process to drive the input and read the output
        SC_THREAD(run_test);
    }

    void run_test() {
        num.write(5); // Set input to 5
        wait(1, SC_NS); // Wait for one nanosecond for the calculation to complete
        cout << "Factorial of " << num.read() << " is " << result.read() << endl;
        sc_stop(); // Stop simulation
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    Testbench tb("tb");
    sc_start();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **Module Definition**: The `FactorialCalculator` module is defined with input and output ports.
- **Constructor**: The constructor sets up a method `calculate_factorial` that is triggered whenever the input changes.
- **Method**: The `calculate_factorial` method reads the input number, computes its factorial, and writes the result to the output port.
- **Testbench**: A simple testbench is provided to drive the input and read the output. It initializes the input to 5, waits for the calculation to complete, and prints the result.
- **Simulation Control**: The simulation is controlled by the `sc_main` function, which creates the testbench and starts the simulation.

This SystemC code can be integrated into an existing testbench using the provided `in` and `out` signals.
