Let's break down the original code first.

### Analysis of the C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Inputs**:
  - A square matrix `mat` of size `n x n`.
- **Outputs**:
  - The sum of the principal diagonal elements.
  - The sum of the secondary diagonal elements.

#### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Constants and Declarations**:
   ```cpp
   const int MAX = 100;
   ```
   - Defines a constant `MAX` with a value of 100, which is used as the maximum size of the matrix.

2. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   void printDiagonalSums(int mat[][MAX], int n)
   ```
   - Declares a function `printDiagonalSums` that takes a 2D array `mat` and an integer `n` representing the size of the matrix.

3. **Variable Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int principal = 0, secondary = 0;
   ```
   - Initializes two integers, `principal` and `secondary`, to zero. These will store the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively.

4. **Nested Loops for Summation**:
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
   { 
       for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)	 
       { 
           if (i == j) 
               principal += mat[i][j]; 
           if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) 
               secondary += mat[i][j]; 
       } 
   }
   ```
   - Uses nested loops to iterate through each element of the matrix.
   - Checks if the current element is part of the principal diagonal (`i == j`) and adds it to `principal`.
   - Checks if the current element is part of the secondary diagonal (`i + j == n - 1`) and adds it to `secondary`.

5. **Output**:
   ```cpp
   cout << "Principal Diagonal:" << principal << endl; 
   cout << "Secondary Diagonal:" << secondary << endl;
   ```
   - Prints the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals.

6. **Driver Code**:
   ```cpp
   int main() 
   { 
       int a[][MAX] = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, 
                       {5, 6, 7, 8}, 
                       {1, 2, 3, 4}, 
                       {5, 6, 7, 8}}; 
       printDiagonalSums(a, 4); 
       return 0; 
   }
   ```
   - Defines a 4x4 matrix `a` and calls `printDiagonalSums` with this matrix and its size.

### SystemC Code

Now, let's translate this logic into a SystemC module. We'll use the provided signals `matrix`, `principal`, and `secondary`.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Define constants
static const int SIZE = 4;  // Assuming a fixed size of 4x4 for simplicity

// Module that calculates the sum of diagonals of a matrix
SC_MODULE(DiagonalSumCalculator) {
    // Input port for the matrix (flattened as 1D array)
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE * SIZE];
    
    // Output ports for the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals
    sc_out<int> principal;
    sc_out<int> secondary;

    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSumCalculator) {
        // Use an SC_METHOD to perform the calculation
        SC_METHOD(calculate_diagonals);
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE * SIZE; i++) {
            sensitive << matrix[i];
        }
    }

    // Method that calculates the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals
    void calculate_diagonals() {
        int principal_sum = 0, secondary_sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                int index = i * SIZE + j;
                if (i == j) {
                    principal_sum += matrix[index].read();
                }
                if ((i + j) == (SIZE - 1)) {
                    secondary_sum += matrix[index].read();
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Write the results to the output ports
        principal.write(principal_sum);
        secondary.write(secondary_sum);
    }
};

```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code:

- **Constants**:
  - `SIZE` is set to 4, assuming a fixed-size 4x4 matrix for simplicity.
  
- **Module Declaration**:
  - `DiagonalSumCalculator` is the name of the SystemC module.
  - It has an array of `sc_in<int>` ports named `matrix` for the input matrix (flattened as a 1D array).
  - It has two `sc_out<int>` ports named `principal` and `secondary` for the output sums.

- **Constructor**:
  - The constructor registers the `calculate_diagonals` method as sensitive to changes on any element of the `matrix` input.

- **Method `calculate_diagonals`**:
  - Initializes `principal_sum` and `secondary_sum` to zero.
  - Iterates over the matrix elements using nested loops.
  - Checks if the current element is part of the principal diagonal (`i == j`) and adds it to `principal_sum`.
  - Checks if the current element is part of the secondary diagonal (`i + j == SIZE - 1`) and adds it to `secondary_sum`.
  - Writes the computed sums to the `principal` and `secondary` output ports.

This SystemC module can be integrated into a larger design and tested using the provided testbench signals.
