**Inputs:**
- `real1` (integer): Real part of the first complex number.
- `imag1` (integer): Imaginary part of the first complex number.
- `real2` (integer): Real part of the second complex number.
- `imag2` (integer): Imaginary part of the second complex number.

**Outputs:**
- `real_sum` (integer): Real part of the sum of the two complex numbers.
- `imag_sum` (integer): Imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers.

### Detailed Explanation:

#### Line-by-Line Analysis:

1. **Include Libraries**:
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the standard library and uses the standard namespace for simplicity.

2. **User-defined Complex Class**:
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
       
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
       
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - A class `Complex` is defined to represent complex numbers.
   - It has two member variables: `real` and `imaginary`.
   - A constructor initializes these variables.
   - The `addComp()` function takes two `Complex` objects and returns their sum as a new `Complex` object.

3. **Driver Code**:
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Creates two instances of `Complex`, `C1` and `C2`, with specified values.
   - Prints the real and imaginary parts of both complex numbers.
   - Calls `addComp()` to calculate the sum of `C1` and `C2`, storing the result in `C3`.
   - Prints the real and imaginary parts of the sum.

### Equivalent SystemC Code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum
    
    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(complex_add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }
    
    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void complex_add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:

- **Class Definition**: The `ComplexAdder` module is defined to handle the addition of two complex numbers.
- **Input Ports**: Four input ports (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`) are declared to receive the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
- **Output Ports**: Two output ports (`real_sum`, `imag_sum`) are declared to send the real and imaginary parts of the sum.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the module and sets up the sensitivity list for the `complex_add` method.
- **Method**: The `complex_add` method reads the input ports, calculates the sum of the real and imaginary parts separately, and writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ program and integrates seamlessly with the provided signals.
