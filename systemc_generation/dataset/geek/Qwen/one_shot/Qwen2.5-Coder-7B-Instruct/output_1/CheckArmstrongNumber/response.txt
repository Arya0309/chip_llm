The provided C++/C code checks if a given integer is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

#### Inputs:
- `num_in`: This is the input integer that needs to be checked whether it is an Armstrong number or not.

#### Outputs:
- `is_armstrong`: This boolean signal indicates whether the input number is an Armstrong number (`true`) or not (`false`).

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   int n = 153;
   int temp = n;
   int p = 0;
   ```
   - `n` is initialized to the input number (in this case, 153).
   - `temp` is set to the value of `n` to keep the original number for comparison later.
   - `p` is initialized to 0, which will store the sum of the cubes of the digits.

2. **Loop to Calculate Sum of Cubes of Digits:**
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       int rem = n % 10;
       p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
       n = n / 10;
   }
   ```
   - The loop runs until `n` becomes 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `rem` is calculated as the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 (i.e., the last digit of `n`).
     - The cube of `rem` is added to `p`.
     - `n` is then updated by removing the last digit (i.e., `n` is divided by 10).

3. **Comparison and Output:**
   ```cpp
   if (temp == p) {
       cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
   } else {
       cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
   }
   ```
   - The loop ends, and the code compares `temp` (the original number) with `p` (the sum of the cubes of the digits).
   - If they are equal, it prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No." indicating that the number is an Armstrong number.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No."

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Here's the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong;  // Output port indicating if the number is an Armstrong number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        // Process to check if the number is an Armstrong number
        SC_THREAD(check_armstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    // Thread to check if the number is an Armstrong number
    void check_armstrong() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        // Loop to calculate sum of cubes of digits
        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p += (rem * rem * rem);
            n /= 10;
        }

        // Compare and assign result to is_armstrong
        if (temp == p) {
            is_armstrong.write(true);
        } else {
            is_armstrong.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration:**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
       sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input port for the number to check
       sc_out<bool> is_armstrong;  // Output port indicating if the number is an Armstrong number
   ```
   - A SystemC module named `ArmstrongChecker` is declared with an input port `num_in` and an output port `is_armstrong`.

2. **Constructor:**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
       // Process to check if the number is an Armstrong number
       SC_THREAD(check_armstrong);
       sensitive << num_in;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the module and sets up a thread `check_armstrong` to handle the logic.
   - The thread is sensitive to changes on `num_in`.

3. **Thread Implementation:**
   ```cpp
   void check_armstrong() {
       int n = num_in.read();
       int temp = n;
       int p = 0;

       // Loop to calculate sum of cubes of digits
       while (n > 0) {
           int rem = n % 10;
           p += (rem * rem * rem);
           n /= 10;
       }

       // Compare and assign result to is_armstrong
       if (temp == p) {
           is_armstrong.write(true);
       } else {
           is_armstrong.write(false);
       }
   }
   ```
   - The `check_armstrong` thread reads the input number, calculates the sum of the cubes of its digits, and compares it with the original number.
   - Based on the comparison, it writes `true` or `false` to the `is_armstrong` output port.

This SystemC code accurately captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
