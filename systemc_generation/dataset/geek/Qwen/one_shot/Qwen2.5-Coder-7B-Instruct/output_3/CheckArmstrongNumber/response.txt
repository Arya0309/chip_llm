**Inputs:**
- `num_in`: An integer input signal representing the number to be checked if it is an Armstrong number.

**Outputs:**
- `is_armstrong`: A boolean output signal indicating whether the input number is an Armstrong number (`true`) or not (`false`).

### Line-by-Line Explanation

The provided C++ code checks if a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is a number such that the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the code:

1. **Variable Declarations:**
   ```cpp
   int n = 153;
   int temp = n;
   int p = 0;
   ```
   - `n` is initialized to 153 (the number to check).
   - `temp` is assigned the value of `n` to preserve the original number for comparison later.
   - `p` is initialized to 0 to store the sum of the cubes of the digits.

2. **Loop to Calculate Sum of Cubes of Digits:**
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       int rem = n % 10;
       p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
       n = n / 10;
   }
   ```
   - This loop runs as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `rem` is calculated as the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 (i.e., the last digit of `n`).
     - `p` is updated by adding the cube of `rem`.
     - `n` is then divided by 10 to remove the last digit.

3. **Condition to Check Armstrong Number:**
   ```cpp
   if (temp == p) {
       cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
   } else {
       cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
   }
   ```
   - If `temp` (the original number) is equal to `p` (the sum of the cubes of the digits), the program prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No."
   - Otherwise, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No."

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the SystemC code that replicates the logic of the provided C++ code. It uses the provided signals `num_in` and `is_armstrong`.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong; // Output port indicating if the number is an Armstrong number

    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        // Process to check if the number is an Armstrong number
        SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    void check_armstrong() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        // Loop to calculate sum of cubes of digits
        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        // Condition to check whether the value of P equals to user input or not
        if (temp == p) {
            is_armstrong.write(true); // Set output to true if Armstrong number
        } else {
            is_armstrong.write(false); // Set output to false otherwise
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **Module Declaration:**
  - `ArmstrongChecker` is a module that takes an integer input `num_in` and produces a boolean output `is_armstrong`.

- **Constructor:**
  - The constructor initializes the module and sets up a method `check_armstrong` to run whenever `num_in` changes.

- **Method `check_armstrong`:**
  - This method reads the current value of `num_in`, performs the same calculations as in the original C++ code to determine if the number is an Armstrong number, and writes the result to `is_armstrong`.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow using the provided signals.
