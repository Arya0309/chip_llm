The provided C++/C code is designed to convert a decimal number into its corresponding binary representation. Here's a breakdown of the inputs and outputs:

**Inputs:**
- `n` (integer): This is the decimal number that needs to be converted to binary.

**Outputs:**
- The function `decToBinary` prints the binary representation of the input decimal number directly to the standard output using `cout`.

### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Include Header Files and Namespace Declaration:**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the necessary header file for input/output operations and sets the standard namespace to `std`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   ```cpp
   void decToBinary(int n)
   ```
   - This defines a function `decToBinary` that takes an integer `n` as its parameter. This function is responsible for converting the decimal number `n` to its binary representation.

3. **Array Declaration:**
   ```cpp
   int binaryNum[32];
   ```
   - An array `binaryNum` of size 32 is declared to store the binary digits of the number. This array is large enough to handle any typical integer value.

4. **Counter Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   int i = 0;
   ```
   - A counter `i` is initialized to zero. This counter will keep track of the current position in the `binaryNum` array where the next binary digit should be stored.

5. **While Loop to Convert Decimal to Binary:**
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
       n = n / 2;
       i++;
   }
   ```
   - This loop continues until `n` becomes zero.
     - Inside the loop, `n % 2` calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 2, which gives the least significant bit of the binary representation.
     - This remainder is then stored in the `binaryNum` array at the position indicated by `i`.
     - `n` is updated to `n / 2`, effectively shifting the bits to the right.
     - `i` is incremented to move to the next position in the `binaryNum` array.

6. **Loop to Print Binary Representation:**
   ```cpp
   for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
       cout << binaryNum[j];
   ```
   - This loop iterates from the last position in the `binaryNum` array back to the first position.
   - It prints each element of the `binaryNum` array, which represents the binary digits of the input decimal number in reverse order.

7. **Main Function:**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int n = 10;
       decToBinary(n);
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function initializes the decimal number `n` to 10 and calls the `decToBinary` function to convert and print its binary representation.

### Equivalent SystemC Code Snippet

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals (`sc_in<int> dec_in` and `sc_out<int> binary_out`) and converts a decimal number to its binary representation:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinaryConverter) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for the binary representation

    int binaryNum[32];  // Array to store binary number
    int i = 0;          // Counter for binary array

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinaryConverter) {
        // Process to perform conversion
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    // Method to convert decimal to binary
    void convert() {
        int n = dec_in.read();  // Read the input decimal number
        i = 0;  // Reset the counter

        // While loop to convert decimal to binary
        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }

        // Initialize the output signal
        binary_out.write(0);

        // Loop to construct the binary output
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            binary_out.write(binary_out.read() * 10 + binaryNum[j]);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Module Declaration:** The `BinaryConverter` module has two ports: `dec_in` for input and `binary_out` for output.
- **Array Declaration:** The `binaryNum` array and the counter `i` are declared to store the binary digits.
- **Constructor:** The constructor connects the `convert` method to the `dec_in` port, making it sensitive to changes in the input.
- **Conversion Method (`convert`):**
  - Reads the input decimal number.
  - Converts the decimal number to binary and stores the result in the `binaryNum` array.
  - Constructs the binary output by iterating over the `binaryNum` array and writing the binary digits to the `binary_out` port.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
