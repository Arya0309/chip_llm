The provided C++ code calculates the compound interest for a given principal amount, interest rate, and time period. The inputs are:
- `principal`: the initial amount of money (in dollars).
- `rate`: the annual interest rate (as a percentage).
- `time`: the duration for which the money is invested (in years).

The output is:
- `CI`: the calculated compound interest.

### Line-by-Line Analysis and Explanation

#### Declarations
```cpp
double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;
```
- Declares three double variables: `principal`, `rate`, and `time` and initializes them with the values 10000, 5, and 2 respectively.

#### Calculation of Compound Interest
```cpp
double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));
```
- Calculates the future value `A` using the formula for compound interest: \( A = P \times (1 + r/n)^{nt} \). Here, `n` is assumed to be 1 (annual compounding), so the formula simplifies to \( A = P \times (1 + r)^t \).

```cpp
double CI = A - principal;
```
- Calculates the compound interest `CI` by subtracting the principal from the future value `A`.

#### Output
```cpp
cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;
```
- Prints the calculated compound interest to the console.

### SystemC Equivalent Code

To convert this C++ code into a SystemC module, we need to define the necessary signals and create a method to perform the calculation. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
    // Input signals
    sc_in<double> principal;
    sc_in<double> rate;
    sc_in<double> time;

    // Output signal
    sc_out<double> ci;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate compound interest
        SC_THREAD(calculate_ci);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculate_ci() {
        while (true) {
            wait(); // Wait for changes on the input signals

            // Calculate compound interest
            double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
            double CI = A - principal.read();

            // Write the result to the output signal
            ci.write(CI);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Input and Output Signals**: The module has three input signals (`principal`, `rate`, `time`) and one output signal (`ci`).
- **Constructor**: The constructor sets up a thread called `calculate_ci` that will run whenever any of the input signals change.
- **Method `calculate_ci`**:
  - Waits for changes on the input signals using `wait()`.
  - Reads the current values of `principal`, `rate`, and `time`.
  - Calculates the compound interest using the same formula as the original C++ code.
  - Writes the calculated compound interest to the output signal `ci`.

This SystemC code should behave identically to the original C++ code but can now be integrated into a SystemC simulation environment, including a testbench that provides the required inputs (`principal`, `rate`, `time`) and verifies the output (`ci`).
