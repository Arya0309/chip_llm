The provided C++ code checks whether a given integer `n` is a prime number. The input is an integer `n`, and the output is a boolean value indicating whether `n` is prime or not.

- **Inputs**: 
  - An integer `n`.

- **Outputs**:
  - A boolean value (`true` if `n` is prime, `false` otherwise).

### Detailed Explanation

Let's break down the C++ code into blocks and explain each part:

#### Block 1: Include Header Files and Namespace Declaration
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
```
This block includes all standard library headers and sets up the standard namespace.

#### Block 2: Main Function
```cpp
int main() {
    int n = 29;
```
Here, the main function starts, and the integer `n` is initialized to 29.

#### Block 3: Initialize Counter
```cpp
    int cnt = 0;
```
A counter `cnt` is initialized to zero. This counter will keep track of the number of divisors of `n`.

#### Block 4: Check if Number is Less Than or Equal to 1
```cpp
    if (n <= 1)
        cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;
```
If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is immediately determined that `n` is not prime, and the program prints this message.

#### Block 5: Loop Through Possible Divisors
```cpp
    else {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0)
                cnt++;
        }
```
If `n` is greater than 1, the program enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n`. For each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`). If true, it increments the counter `cnt`.

#### Block 6: Check Number of Divisors
```cpp
        if (cnt > 2)
            cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;
        else
            cout << n << " is prime" << endl;
    }
```
After the loop, the program checks if `cnt` is greater than 2. If it is, `n` is not prime, and the program prints this message. Otherwise, it prints that `n` is prime.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that incorporates the provided signals and maintains the same logic:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n;      // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_prime;  // Output port indicating if n is prime

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        // Process to determine if n is prime
        SC_METHOD(check_prime);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to check if n is prime
    void check_prime() {
        bool prime = true;
        int cnt = 0;

        if (n.read() <= 1) {
            prime = false;
        } else {
            for (int i = 1; i <= n.read(); i++) {
                if (n.read() % i == 0) {
                    cnt++;
                }
            }
            if (cnt > 2) {
                prime = false;
            }
        }

        is_prime.write(prime);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **Inputs**:
  - `sc_in<int> n`: An input signal representing the number to check for primality.

- **Outputs**:
  - `sc_out<bool> is_prime`: An output signal indicating whether the input number `n` is prime.

- **Process**:
  - The `check_prime` method is triggered whenever the input `n` changes.
  - It initializes a boolean variable `prime` to `true`.
  - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it sets `prime` to `false`.
  - It then iterates through possible divisors from 1 to `n` and counts how many times `n` is divisible.
  - If the count of divisors is greater than 2, it sets `prime` to `false`.
  - Finally, it writes the value of `prime` to the `is_prime` output signal.

This SystemC code accurately mirrors the functionality of the original C++ code while being compatible with a SystemC-based testbench.
