#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: None
- **Outputs**: 
  - `real_sum` (integer): Real part of the sum of the two complex numbers.
  - `imag_sum` (integer): Imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Imports and Namespace**
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the standard library and uses the standard namespace for simplicity.

2. **User Defined Complex Class**
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
   
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
   
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - A class `Complex` is defined with public members `real` and `imaginary`.
   - A constructor initializes these members.
   - The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects, adds their real and imaginary parts respectively, and returns a new `Complex` object representing their sum.

3. **Driver Code**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
   
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
   
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` are created with initial values.
   - Their real and imaginary parts are printed.
   - The `addComp` method is called to compute the sum of `C1` and `C2`, which is stored in `C3`.
   - The result is printed.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

This SystemC code defines a module `ComplexAdder` that takes four integer inputs (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`) representing the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers. It computes the sum of these two complex numbers and outputs the real and imaginary parts of the sum through `real_sum` and `imag_sum` ports, respectively.
