**Inputs:**
- `principal`: The initial amount of money invested or borrowed.
- `rate`: The annual interest rate (in percentage).
- `time`: The duration for which the money is invested or borrowed (in years).

**Outputs:**
- `ci`: The calculated compound interest.

### Detailed Explanation:

The provided C++ code calculates the compound interest for a given principal amount, interest rate, and time period. Here's a line-by-line breakdown:

1. **Include Header Files:**
   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   ```
   - This includes a standard library header file containing various functions and classes.

2. **Using Namespace:**
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This directive allows us to use names from the standard library without prefixing them with `std::`.

3. **Main Function:**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;
   ```
   - The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
   - Three variables (`principal`, `rate`, and `time`) are initialized with values of 10000, 5, and 2 respectively.

4. **Calculate Compound Interest:**
   ```cpp
       double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));
       double CI = A - principal;
   ```
   - `A` is calculated as the future value of the investment, which is the principal multiplied by `(1 + rate / 100)` raised to the power of `time`.
   - `CI` is the compound interest, which is the difference between the future value `A` and the principal.

5. **Output the Result:**
   ```cpp
       cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;
   ```
   - The result is printed to the console.

6. **Return Statement:**
   ```cpp
       return 0;
   ```
   - The program returns 0 indicating successful execution.

### Equivalent SystemC Code:

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that uses the provided signals (`principal`, `rate`, `time`, and `ci`). This code integrates seamlessly with an existing testbench and performs the same calculation:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
    sc_in<double> principal;  // Input port for the principal amount
    sc_in<double> rate;     // Input port for the interest rate
    sc_in<double> time;     // Input port for the time period
    sc_out<double> ci;      // Output port for the compound interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate compound interest
        SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculate_ci() {
        double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
        double CI = A - principal.read();
        ci.write(CI);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code:

- **Module Declaration:**
  ```cpp
  SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator)
  ```
  - Declares a new SystemC module named `CompoundInterestCalculator`.

- **Input Ports:**
  ```cpp
  sc_in<double> principal;
  sc_in<double> rate;
  sc_in<double> time;
  ```
  - Defines three input ports corresponding to the inputs of the original C++ code.

- **Output Port:**
  ```cpp
  sc_out<double> ci;
  ```
  - Defines one output port for the compound interest.

- **Constructor:**
  ```cpp
  SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
      SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
      sensitive << principal << rate << time;
  }
  ```
  - Registers a method (`calculate_ci`) to be called whenever any of the input ports change.

- **Method to Calculate Compound Interest:**
  ```cpp
  void calculate_ci() {
      double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
      double CI = A - principal.read();
      ci.write(CI);
  }
  ```
  - Reads the values from the input ports.
  - Calculates the compound interest similarly to the original C++ code.
  - Writes the calculated compound interest to the output port.

This SystemC code accurately represents the functionality of the original C++ code while being compatible with the provided signals.
