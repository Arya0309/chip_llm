The provided C++ code checks whether a given integer `n` is a prime number or not. It takes no external inputs directly from the user but uses a predefined value for `n`. The output is determined internally within the code and printed to the console.

**Inputs:**
- None (the value of `n` is hardcoded as 29)

**Outputs:**
- A string indicating whether the number is "prime" or "NOT prime".

### Detailed Explanation of the Code

#### Line-by-Line Analysis:

1. **Include Header Files**
   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   ```
   This line includes all standard library headers.

2. **Namespace Declaration**
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   This line sets the standard namespace, allowing us to use `cout` without prefixing it with `std::`.

3. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main() {
   ```
   The entry point of the program.

4. **Initialization of Variable `n`**
   ```cpp
   int n = 29;
   ```
   The variable `n` is initialized to 29, which is the number we want to check for primality.

5. **Counter Initialization**
   ```cpp
   int cnt = 0;
   ```
   A counter `cnt` is initialized to zero to keep track of the number of divisors.

6. **Check if Number is Less Than or Equal to 1**
   ```cpp
   if (n <= 1)
       cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;
   ```
   If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is immediately determined that `n` is not prime, and the message is printed.

7. **Loop Through Numbers from 1 to `n`**
   ```cpp
   else {
       for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
           if (n % i == 0)
               cnt++;
       }
   ```
   If `n` is greater than 1, the code enters a loop that runs from 1 to `n`. For each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by the current number `i` (i.e., if `n % i == 0`). If it is, the counter `cnt` is incremented.

8. **Check if Count of Divisors is Greater Than 2**
   ```cpp
   if (cnt > 2)
       cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;
   ```
   After the loop, if the counter `cnt` is greater than 2, it means `n` has more than two divisors, and thus it is not prime. The appropriate message is printed.

9. **Output if `n` is Prime**
   ```cpp
   else
       cout << n << " is prime" << endl;
   ```
   If the counter `cnt` is not greater than 2, it means `n` is prime, and the appropriate message is printed.

10. **Return Statement**
    ```cpp
    return 0;
    ```
    The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that incorporates the provided signals (`n` and `is_prime`) and replicates the logic of the original C++ code.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_prime; // Output port for the result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        // Process to determine if the number is prime
        SC_METHOD(check_prime);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is prime
    void check_prime() {
        bool is_prime_value = false;
        int cnt = 0;

        // If number is less than/equal to 1, it is not prime
        if (n.read() <= 1) {
            is_prime_value = false;
        } else {
            // Check for divisors from 1 to n
            for (int i = 1; i <= n.read(); i++) {
                if (n.read() % i == 0) {
                    cnt++;
                }
            }

            // If n is divisible by more than 2 numbers, then it is not prime
            if (cnt > 2) {
                is_prime_value = false;
            } else {
                is_prime_value = true;
            }
        }

        // Assign the result to the output port
        is_prime.write(is_prime_value);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Module Declaration**: The module `PrimeChecker` is declared, containing input `n` and output `is_prime`.
- **Constructor**: The constructor initializes a method `check_prime` that is triggered whenever the input `n` changes.
- **Method `check_prime`**:
  - Initializes a boolean variable `is_prime_value` to `false`.
  - Checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1 and sets `is_prime_value` to `false` if true.
  - Otherwise, it counts the number of divisors of `n` and sets `is_prime_value` accordingly.
  - Writes the result to the output port `is_prime`.

This SystemC code provides a reusable component that can be integrated into larger SystemC designs, leveraging the provided signals for seamless interaction with testbenches.
