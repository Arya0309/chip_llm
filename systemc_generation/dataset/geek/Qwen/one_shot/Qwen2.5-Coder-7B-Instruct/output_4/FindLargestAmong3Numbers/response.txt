The provided C++ program takes three integer inputs (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and outputs the largest of these three numbers. Specifically:

- **Inputs**:
  - Three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`.

- **Output**:
  - One integer representing the largest value among `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Detailed Explanation of the C++ Code
1. **Variable Declarations**:
   ```cpp
   int a = 1, b = 2, c = 11;
   ```
   - Three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared and initialized to specific values.

2. **Conditional Statements**:
   ```cpp
   if (a >= b) {
       if (a >= c)
           cout << a;
       else
           cout << c;
   } else {
       if (b >= c)
           cout << b;
       else
           cout << c;
   }
   ```
   - This block of code uses nested `if-else` statements to determine which of the three numbers is the largest.
   - First, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If true, it then checks if `a` is also greater than or equal to `c`. If both conditions are met, `a` is the largest and is printed.
   - If the condition `a >= b` is false, it means either `b` is larger than `a` or they are equal. It then checks if `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If this condition is true, `b` is the largest and is printed.
   - If neither of the inner conditions is true, `c` must be the largest and is printed.

3. **Return Statement**:
   ```cpp
   return 0;
   ```
   - The function returns `0`, indicating successful execution.

### SystemC Equivalent Code
Here is the equivalent SystemC code that replicates the logic of the given C++ program:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LargestFinder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_in<int> c;  // Input port for the third number
    sc_out<int> largest;  // Output port for the largest number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LargestFinder) {
        // Process to find the largest number
        SC_METHOD(find_largest);
        sensitive << a << b << c;
    }

    // Method to determine the largest number
    void find_largest() {
        if (a.read() >= b.read()) {
            if (a.read() >= c.read())
                largest.write(a.read());
            else
                largest.write(c.read());
        } else {
            if (b.read() >= c.read())
                largest.write(b.read());
            else
                largest.write(c.read());
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code
1. **Module Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(LargestFinder) {
   ```
   - A SystemC module named `LargestFinder` is declared.

2. **Input and Output Ports**:
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
   sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
   sc_in<int> c;  // Input port for the third number
   sc_out<int> largest;  // Output port for the largest number
   ```
   - Input ports `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared to receive integer values from external sources.
   - An output port `largest` is declared to send the largest value back.

3. **Constructor**:
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(LargestFinder) {
       // Process to find the largest number
       SC_METHOD(find_largest);
       sensitive << a << b << c;
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the `find_largest` method to be called whenever any of the input ports `a`, `b`, or `c` change.

4. **Method to Find the Largest Number**:
   ```cpp
   void find_largest() {
       if (a.read() >= b.read()) {
           if (a.read() >= c.read())
               largest.write(a.read());
           else
               largest.write(c.read());
       } else {
           if (b.read() >= c.read())
               largest.write(b.read());
           else
               largest.write(c.read());
       }
   }
   ```
   - This method reads the values from the input ports `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It uses nested `if-else` statements similar to the C++ code to determine the largest number and writes it to the `largest` output port.

This SystemC code accurately mirrors the logic of the original C++ program and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
