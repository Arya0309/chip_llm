#### Inputs:
- `real1`: An integer representing the real part of the first complex number.
- `imag1`: An integer representing the imaginary part of the first complex number.
- `real2`: An integer representing the real part of the second complex number.
- `imag2`: An integer representing the imaginary part of the second complex number.

#### Outputs:
- `real_sum`: An integer representing the real part of the sum of the two complex numbers.
- `imag_sum`: An integer representing the imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers.

### Detailed Explanation of the Code

1. **Header File Inclusion**
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   ```
   This includes all standard library headers, which is generally not recommended for production code but useful for simplicity in this context.

2. **Namespace Declaration**
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   This makes the standard library functions available without prefixing them with `std::`.

3. **Class Definition**
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
       
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
       
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - A `Complex` class is defined with public members `real` and `imaginary`.
   - A constructor initializes these members with default values if none are provided.
   - The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects, adds their corresponding real and imaginary parts, and returns a new `Complex` object containing the result.

4. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` are created with specified real and imaginary parts.
   - The sum of `C1` and `C2` is calculated using the `addComp` method and stored in `C3`.
   - The results are printed to the console.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

To convert the above C++ code into SystemC, we need to define a module that takes four input ports (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`) and produces two output ports (`real_sum`, `imag_sum`). Here's how you can do it:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum; // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum; // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum
    
    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }
    
    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Definition**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
   ```
   Defines a SystemC module named `ComplexAdder`.

2. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> real1, imag1, real2, imag2;
   sc_out<int> real_sum, imag_sum;
   ```
   Declares input ports for the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers and output ports for the real and imaginary parts of the sum.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
       SC_METHOD(add);
       sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
   }
   ```
   - Constructs the module and binds the `add` method to be called whenever any of the input ports change.

4. **Method to Perform Addition**
   ```cpp
   void add() {
       real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
       imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
   }
   ```
   - Reads the values from the input ports and writes the sum of the real parts to `real_sum` and the sum of the imaginary parts to `imag_sum`.

This SystemC code accurately reflects the logic of the original C++ program and can be integrated into a larger system for further testing and simulation.
