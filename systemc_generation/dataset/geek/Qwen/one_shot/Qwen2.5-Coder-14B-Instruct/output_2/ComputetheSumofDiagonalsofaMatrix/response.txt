   - **Inputs**: A square matrix `mat` of size `n x n`, where `n` is the dimension of the matrix.
   - **Outputs**: Two sums, `principal` and `secondary`, representing the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix, respectively.

3. **Detailed Explanation**:
   - The program starts by including necessary headers and defining a constant `MAX` which sets the maximum size of the matrix.
   - The function `printDiagonalSums` takes a 2D array `mat` and its size `n` as arguments.
   - Inside the function, two variables `principal` and `secondary` are initialized to zero. These will hold the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively.
   - A nested loop iterates over each element of the matrix:
     - If the row index `i` is equal to the column index `j`, the element is part of the principal diagonal, and its value is added to `principal`.
     - If the sum of the row index `i` and column index `j` equals `n-1`, the element is part of the secondary diagonal, and its value is added to `secondary`.
   - After the loops complete, the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals are printed to the console.
   - The `main` function initializes a sample 4x4 matrix and calls `printDiagonalSums` with this matrix and its size.

4. **SystemC Code**:
   Below is the equivalent SystemC code that captures the logic of the original C++/C source. It uses the provided signals `matrix`, `principal`, and `secondary`.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSumCalculator) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];  // Input port for the matrix elements
    sc_out<int> principal;    // Output port for the principal diagonal sum
    sc_out<int> secondary;    // Output port for the secondary diagonal sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSumCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate the diagonal sums
        SC_METHOD(calculateDiagonalSums);
        sensitive << matrix[0] << matrix[1] << matrix[2] << matrix[3]; // Assuming SIZE is 4 for simplicity
    }

    // Method to calculate the sums of the diagonals
    void calculateDiagonalSums() {
        const int n = 4; // Assuming SIZE is 4 for simplicity
        int principalSum = 0, secondarySum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == j) {
                    principalSum += matrix[i*n + j].read();
                }
                if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) {
                    secondarySum += matrix[i*n + j].read();
                }
            }
        }

        principal.write(principalSum);
        secondary.write(secondarySum);
    }
};
```

**Explanation of the SystemC Code**:
- The `DiagonalSumCalculator` module has three ports: `matrix` for input, and `principal` and `secondary` for outputs.
- The constructor defines a method `calculateDiagonalSums` that is sensitive to changes in the `matrix` inputs.
- Inside `calculateDiagonalSums`, the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals are calculated using nested loops similar to the original C++ code.
- The results are written to the `principal` and `secondary` output ports.

This SystemC code can be integrated into a testbench that provides the matrix elements through the `matrix` input ports and reads the diagonal sums from the `principal` and `secondary` output ports.
