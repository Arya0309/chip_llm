!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - **Inputs**: 
     - A vector of integers (`v`), which represents the sorted array to search through.
     - An integer (`target`), which is the element to be searched within the vector.
   - **Outputs**:
     - A boolean value indicating whether the target element was found in the vector.

2. **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - These lines include necessary headers and bring the standard library into scope.

   ```cpp
   bool binarySearch(vector<int>& v, int target) {
   ```
   - This function `binarySearch` takes a reference to a vector of integers and an integer target as inputs and returns a boolean indicating if the target is found.

   ```cpp
       int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
   ```
   - Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to represent the current search range within the vector.

   ```cpp
       while (low <= high) {
   ```
   - Enter a loop that continues as long as there is a valid search range.

   ```cpp
           int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
   ```
   - Calculate the middle index of the current search range.

   ```cpp
           if (v[mid] == target) {
               return true;
           }
   ```
   - If the middle element equals the target, return true indicating the target is found.

   ```cpp
           if (v[mid] > target)
               high = mid - 1;
   ```
   - If the middle element is greater than the target, adjust the `high` pointer to search the left half.

   ```cpp
           else
               low = mid + 1;
   ```
   - If the middle element is less than the target, adjust the `low` pointer to search the right half.

   ```cpp
       return false;
   ```
   - If the loop exits without finding the target, return false.

   ```cpp
   int main() {
       vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};
       int target = 8;
       if (binarySearch(v, target)) {
           cout << target << " found.";
       } else {
           cout << target << " NOT found.";
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function initializes a vector and a target, calls `binarySearch`, and prints whether the target was found.

3. **SystemC Code**:
   ```cpp
   #include <systemc.h>

   SC_MODULE(BinarySearch) {
       sc_in<int> target;
       sc_out<bool> found;
       sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v;

       SC_CTOR(BinarySearch) : v("v", 8) {
           SC_THREAD(search);
           sensitive << target;
           for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
               sensitive << v[i];
           }
       }

       void search() {
           int low = 0;
           int high = v.size() - 1;
           while (low <= high) {
               int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
               if (v[mid].read() == target.read()) {
                   found.write(true);
                   return;
               }
               if (v[mid].read() > target.read())
                   high = mid - 1;
               else
                   low = mid + 1;
           }
           found.write(false);
       }
   };
   ```

**Explanation of SystemC Code**:
- **Module Definition**: The `BinarySearch` module encapsulates the binary search logic.
- **Ports**: 
  - `sc_in<int> target`: Input port for the target value.
  - `sc_out<bool> found`: Output port indicating if the target was found.
  - `sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v`: Vector of input ports for the array elements.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the vector size and sets up the sensitivity list for the `search` method.
- **Search Method**: Implements the binary search logic, reading from the ports and writing to the `found` port based on the search results.
