### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Inputs**: Two binary strings `A` and `B`.
- **Output**: A single binary string representing the sum of `A` and `B`.

#### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `addBinary` takes two binary strings `A` and `B` as input.
2. **Length Check and Swap**: If the length of `A` is greater than `B`, the function calls itself with `B` and `A` swapped. This ensures that `B` is always the longer string.
3. **Padding Calculation**: It calculates the difference in lengths between `A` and `B` and creates a padding string filled with zeros to match the length of `B`.
4. **Padding Addition**: The padding is added to the beginning of `A` to make both strings of equal length.
5. **Result Initialization**: An empty string `res` is initialized to store the result, and a character `carry` is initialized to '0'.
6. **Bitwise Addition Loop**: A loop iterates over the bits of `A` and `B` from right to left:
   - If both bits are '1', it checks the carry:
     - If carry is '1', append '1' to `res` and keep carry as '1'.
     - If carry is '0', append '0' to `res` and set carry to '1'.
   - If both bits are '0', it checks the carry:
     - If carry is '1', append '1' to `res` and reset carry to '0'.
     - If carry is '0', append '0' to `res' and keep carry as '0'.
   - If one bit is '1' and the other is '0', it checks the carry:
     - If carry is '1', append '0' to `res` and keep carry as '1'.
     - If carry is '0', append '1' to `res` and reset carry to '0'.
7. **Final Carry Check**: After the loop, if there's a carry left, it appends '1' to `res`.
8. **Reversing the Result**: The result string `res` is reversed to get the correct order.
9. **Removing Leading Zeros**: Any leading zeros in `res` are removed.
10. **Return Result**: The final result is returned.

#### Driver Code:
The `main` function initializes two binary strings `a` and `b`, calls `addBinary` with these strings, and prints the result.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that implements the same logic:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

SC_MODULE(BinaryAdder) {
    sc_in<std::string> A;  // Input port for the first binary string
    sc_in<std::string> B;  // Input port for the second binary string
    sc_out<std::string> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Method to add two binary strings
    void addBinary() {
        std::string a = A.read();
        std::string b = B.read();

        // Ensure B is the longer string
        if (a.length() > b.length())
            return addBinary(b, a);

        int diff = b.length() - a.length();
        std::string padding(diff, '0');
        a = padding + a;

        std::string res;
        char carry = '0';

        for (int i = a.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (a[i] == '1' && b[i] == '1') {
                if (carry == '1')
                    res.push_back('1'), carry = '1';
                else
                    res.push_back('0'), carry = '1';
            } else if (a[i] == '0' && b[i] == '0') {
                if (carry == '1')
                    res.push_back('1'), carry = '0';
                else
                    res.push_back('0'), carry = '0';
            } else if (a[i] != b[i]) {
                if (carry == '1')
                    res.push_back('0'), carry = '1';
                else
                    res.push_back('1'), carry = '0';
            }
        }

        if (carry == '1')
            res.push_back(carry);

        std::reverse(res.begin(), res.end());

        int index = 0;
        while (index + 1 < res.length() && res[index] == '0')
            index++;

        sum.write(res.substr(index));
    }

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinaryAdder) {
        SC_METHOD(addBinary);
        sensitive << A << B;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code:
1. **Module Definition**: The `BinaryAdder` module defines three ports: `A`, `B`, and `sum`.
2. **Method Definition**: The `addBinary` method reads the input strings `A` and `B`, performs the binary addition logic as described, and writes the result to the `sum` port.
3. **Constructor**: The constructor sets up the `addBinary` method to be triggered whenever either `A` or `B` changes.

This SystemC code can be integrated into a larger SystemC design and used in a high-level synthesis flow.
