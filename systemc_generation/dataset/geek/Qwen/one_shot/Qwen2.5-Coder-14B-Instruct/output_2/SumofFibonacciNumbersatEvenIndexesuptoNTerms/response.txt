   - **Input**: An integer `n` which represents the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to consider.
   - **Output**: The sum of the Fibonacci numbers at even indices up to the `2*n`-th term.

3. **Line-by-Line Summary**:
   - The program starts by including necessary headers and using the standard namespace.
   - The function `calculateEvenSum` is defined to compute the sum of even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to `2*n` terms.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 0 immediately.
     - An array `fibo` of size `2*n + 1` is declared to store Fibonacci numbers.
     - The first two Fibonacci numbers, `fibo[0]` and `fibo[1]`, are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
     - A variable `sum` is initialized to 0 to store the sum of even-indexed Fibonacci numbers.
     - A `for` loop runs from 2 to `2*n` to fill the `fibo` array and compute the sum of even-indexed Fibonacci numbers.
       - Inside the loop, each Fibonacci number is computed as the sum of the two preceding numbers.
       - If the current index `i` is even, the corresponding Fibonacci number is added to `sum`.
     - The function returns the computed sum.
   - The `main` function demonstrates the use of `calculateEvenSum` by calculating and printing the sum of even-indexed Fibonacci numbers for `n = 8`.

4. **SystemC Code Snippet**:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(FibonacciSum) {
    sc_in<int> n;  // Input port for the number of terms
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the sum of even-indexed Fibonacci numbers

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(FibonacciSum) {
        // Process to compute the sum of even-indexed Fibonacci numbers
        SC_METHOD(computeSum);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to compute the sum of even-indexed Fibonacci numbers
    void computeSum() {
        int local_n = n.read();
        if (local_n <= 0) {
            sum.write(0);
            return;
        }

        int fibo[2 * local_n + 1];
        fibo[0] = 0;
        fibo[1] = 1;
        int local_sum = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i <= 2 * local_n; i++) {
            fibo[i] = fibo[i - 1] + fibo[i - 2];
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                local_sum += fibo[i];
            }
        }

        sum.write(local_sum);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code:
- **Module Declaration**: The `FibonacciSum` module is declared to encapsulate the logic of computing the sum of even-indexed Fibonacci numbers.
- **Ports**: 
  - `n`: Input port to receive the number of terms.
  - `sum`: Output port to send the computed sum.
- **Constructor**: The constructor sets up a method `computeSum` that is sensitive to changes in the input `n`.
- **Method `computeSum`**:
  - Reads the input `n`.
  - Checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0 and writes 0 to the output `sum` if true.
  - Initializes the Fibonacci array and the sum variable.
  - Iterates through the loop to compute Fibonacci numbers and accumulates the sum of even-indexed numbers.
  - Writes the final sum to the output port `sum`.
