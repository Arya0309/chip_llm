   - **Inputs**: The code takes three inputs which are the principal amount, the rate of interest, and the time period.
   - **Outputs**: The code outputs the compound interest calculated based on the provided inputs.

2. **Detailed Explanation of the Code**:
   - Line 1-3: Include necessary headers and use the standard namespace.
   - Line 6: The `main` function starts the execution of the program.
   - Line 8-10: Initialize variables `principal`, `rate`, and `time` with values 10000, 5, and 2 respectively.
   - Line 13: Calculate the amount `A` after applying compound interest using the formula \( A = P \times (1 + \frac{r}{100})^t \).
   - Line 14: Compute the compound interest `CI` by subtracting the principal from the amount `A`.
   - Line 16: Print the calculated compound interest.
   - Line 18: Return 0 indicating successful execution.

3. **SystemC Equivalent Code**:
   Below is the SystemC code that replicates the functionality of the provided C++ code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to calculate compound interest
SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
    sc_in<double> principal; // Input port for the principal amount
    sc_in<double> rate;      // Input port for the rate of interest
    sc_in<double> time;      // Input port for the time period
    sc_out<double> ci;       // Output port for the compound interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate compound interest
        SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculate_ci() {
        double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
        double CI = A - principal.read();
        ci.write(CI);
    }
};
```

4. **Explanation of the SystemC Code**:
   - Line 1-3: Include the SystemC library and declare the module name `CompoundInterestCalculator`.
   - Line 5-7: Declare input and output ports corresponding to the principal, rate, time, and compound interest.
   - Line 9-10: Constructor of the module where the method `calculate_ci` is defined and made sensitive to changes in the input ports.
   - Line 13-17: Define the method `calculate_ci` which performs the calculation of compound interest using the same formula as in the original C++ code. It reads the values from the input ports, calculates the compound interest, and writes the result to the output port `ci`.

This SystemC code can be integrated into a larger design and tested using the provided signals `principal`, `rate`, `time`, and `ci`.
