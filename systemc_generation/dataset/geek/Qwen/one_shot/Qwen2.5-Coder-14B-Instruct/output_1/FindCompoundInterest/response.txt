!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1. **Inputs and Outputs of the Code**:
   - **Inputs**: 
     - `principal`: The initial amount of money.
     - `rate`: The annual interest rate.
     - `time`: The time the money is invested for, in years.
   - **Outputs**: 
     - `CI`: The compound interest calculated.

2. **Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation**:
   - `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: Includes all standard C++ libraries.
   - `using namespace std;`: Uses the standard namespace.
   - `int main()`: The main function where execution starts.
     - `double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;`: Declares and initializes the variables `principal`, `rate`, and `time` with specific values.
     - `double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));`: Calculates the total amount after interest using the formula for compound interest \(A = P \times (1 + \frac{r}{100})^t\), where \(P\) is the principal, \(r\) is the rate, and \(t\) is the time.
     - `double CI = A - principal;`: Calculates the compound interest by subtracting the principal from the total amount.
     - `cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;`: Outputs the calculated compound interest.
     - `return 0;`: Ends the main function and returns 0 indicating successful execution.

3. **SystemC Code Snippet**:
   Below is the equivalent SystemC code that uses the provided signals (`principal`, `rate`, `time`, and `ci`) and performs the same logic as the C++ code.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>
#include <cmath> // Include cmath for pow function

// Module to calculate compound interest
SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
    sc_in<double> principal; // Input port for principal amount
    sc_in<double> rate;      // Input port for interest rate
    sc_in<double> time;      // Input port for time period
    sc_out<double> ci;       // Output port for compound interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate compound interest
        SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculate_ci() {
        double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
        double CI = A - principal.read();
        ci.write(CI);
    }
};
```

**Explanation of the SystemC Code**:
- `#include <systemc.h>`: Includes the SystemC library.
- `#include <cmath>`: Includes the cmath library for the `pow` function.
- `SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator)`: Defines a SystemC module named `CompoundInterestCalculator`.
- `sc_in<double> principal;`, `sc_in<double> rate;`, `sc_in<double> time;`, `sc_out<double> ci;`: Declares the input and output ports.
- `SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator)`: Constructor for the module.
  - `SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);`: Declares a method `calculate_ci` that will be executed whenever any of the sensitive signals change.
  - `sensitive << principal << rate << time;`: Specifies that the method `calculate_ci` should be sensitive to changes in `principal`, `rate`, and `time`.
- `void calculate_ci()`: The method that performs the compound interest calculation.
  - `double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());`: Calculates the total amount after interest.
  - `double CI = A - principal.read();`: Calculates the compound interest.
  - `ci.write(CI);`: Writes the calculated compound interest to the output port `ci`.

This SystemC module can be integrated into a larger SystemC design and used with the provided testbench signals.
