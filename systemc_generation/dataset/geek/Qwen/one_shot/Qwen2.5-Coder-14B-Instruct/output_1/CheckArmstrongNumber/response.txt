   - `#include <iostream>`: This includes the iostream library which is used for input and output operations.
   - `using namespace std;`: This line allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.
   - `int main() {`: The main function where the execution of the program starts.
   - `int n = 153;`: Initializes an integer variable `n` with the value 153. This is the number to be checked if it's an Armstrong number.
   - `int temp = n;`: Creates a temporary variable `temp` and assigns it the value of `n`. This is used later to compare with the calculated sum of cubes of digits.
   - `int p = 0;`: Initializes another integer variable `p` to 0. This variable will store the sum of cubes of each digit.
   - `while (n > 0) {`: A while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. This loop calculates the sum of cubes of each digit of `n`.
     - `int rem = n % 10;`: Calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, which gives the last digit of `n`.
     - `p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);`: Adds the cube of the last digit to `p`.
     - `n = n / 10;`: Removes the last digit from `n` by performing integer division by 10.
   - `if (temp == p) {`: Checks if the original number `temp` is equal to the calculated sum `p`.
     - `cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");`: If true, prints that the number is an Armstrong number.
   - `else {`: If the condition is false, executes this block.
     - `cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");`: Prints that the number is not an Armstrong number.
   - `return 0;`: Ends the main function and returns 0 indicating successful execution.

4. **SystemC Code**:
   The SystemC code below implements the same logic as the provided C++ code using the provided signals.

```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;  // Input signal for the number to be checked
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong; // Output signal indicating if the number is an Armstrong number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        // Process to check if the number is an Armstrong number
        SC_METHOD(check_armstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is an Armstrong number
    void check_armstrong() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        // Calculate the sum of cubes of each digit
        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        // Check if the sum of cubes equals the original number
        if (temp == p) {
            is_armstrong.write(true);
        } else {
            is_armstrong.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

This SystemC module `ArmstrongChecker` takes an integer input `num_in` and outputs a boolean `is_armstrong` indicating whether the input number is an Armstrong number. The logic closely follows the original C++ code, with adjustments to fit the SystemC syntax and the use of input/output signals.
