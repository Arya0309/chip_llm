   - **Inputs**: Two integers, `a` and `b`.
   - **Output**: The least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

2. **Line-by-Line Analysis**:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the iostream library for input/output operations and uses the standard namespace.

   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int a = 15, b = 20, max_num, flag = 1;
   ```
   - The main function starts, initializing variables `a` and `b` to 15 and 20 respectively. `max_num` is used to store the maximum of `a` and `b`, and `flag` is a control variable for the while loop.

   ```cpp
       max_num = (a > b) ? a : b;
   ```
   - A ternary operator is used to determine the larger of `a` and `b`, which is stored in `max_num`.

   ```cpp
       while (flag) {
   ```
   - A while loop begins, which will continue indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered.

   ```cpp
           if (max_num % a == 0 && max_num % b == 0) {
               cout << "LCM of " << a << " and " << b << " is "
                   << max_num;
               break;
           }
   ```
   - Inside the loop, an `if` statement checks if `max_num` is divisible by both `a` and `b`. If true, it prints the LCM and breaks out of the loop.

   ```cpp
           ++max_num;
       }
   ```
   - If `max_num` is not divisible by both `a` and `b`, it is incremented by 1, and the loop continues.

   ```cpp
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The program returns 0, indicating successful execution.

3. **SystemC Code Equivalent**:
   Below is the SystemC code that implements the same logic using the provided signals:

   ```cpp
   #include <systemc.h>

   SC_MODULE(LCMCalculator) {
       sc_in<int> a;          // Input port for the first number
       sc_in<int> b;          // Input port for the second number
       sc_out<int> lcm_result; // Output port for the LCM result

       // Constructor
       SC_CTOR(LCMCalculator) {
           // Process to calculate LCM
           SC_THREAD(calculate_lcm);
           sensitive << a << b;
       }

       // Method to calculate the LCM
       void calculate_lcm() {
           int max_num, flag = 1;

           // Determine the larger of a and b
           max_num = (a.read() > b.read()) ? a.read() : b.read();

           while (flag) {
               // Check if max_num is divisible by both a and b
               if (max_num % a.read() == 0 && max_num % b.read() == 0) {
                   lcm_result.write(max_num);
                   break;
               }

               // Increment max_num
               ++max_num;
           }
       }
   };
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - The `LCMCalculator` module is defined with input ports `a` and `b` and an output port `lcm_result`.
   - The `calculate_lcm` method is executed as a thread, sensitive to changes in `a` and `b`.
   - Inside the method, the logic to find the LCM is implemented similarly to the C++ code, using the `read()` method to access the values of `a` and `b`.
   - When the LCM is found, it is written to the `lcm_result` port, which can be used by the testbench for verification.
