   - **Inputs**: The program takes two complex numbers as input, each consisting of a real part and an imaginary part.
   - **Outputs**: The program outputs the sum of the two complex numbers, also represented as a complex number with a real part and an imaginary part.

3. **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
   - **Lines 1-5**: Include necessary libraries and use the standard namespace.
   - **Lines 7-18**: Define a `Complex` class with public integer members `real` and `imaginary`. It includes a constructor to initialize these members and a method `addComp` to add two complex numbers.
   - **Lines 21-22**: Declare two complex numbers `C1` and `C2` with specific real and imaginary parts.
   - **Lines 24-26**: Print the first complex number.
   - **Lines 28-30**: Print the second complex number.
   - **Lines 32-33**: Declare a third complex number `C3` to store the result.
   - **Lines 35-36**: Call the `addComp` method to add `C1` and `C2`, and store the result in `C3`.
   - **Lines 38-40**: Print the sum of the two complex numbers.

4. **SystemC Code Snippet**:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// SystemC module to add two complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum; // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum; // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform complex addition
        SC_METHOD(add_complex);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add_complex() {
        int real_part = real1.read() + real2.read();
        int imag_part = imag1.read() + imag2.read();
        real_sum.write(real_part);
        imag_sum.write(imag_part);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code:
- **Module Declaration**: The `ComplexAdder` module is declared with four input ports (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`) and two output ports (`real_sum`, `imag_sum`).
- **Constructor**: The constructor initializes a process `add_complex` that is sensitive to changes in any of the input ports.
- **Method `add_complex`**: This method reads the values from the input ports, computes the sum of the real parts and the imaginary parts separately, and writes the results to the respective output ports.

This SystemC module can be integrated into a larger design and tested using the provided signals (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, `real_sum`, `imag_sum`).
