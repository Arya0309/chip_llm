   **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - **Input**: An integer `n` which is the decimal number to be converted to binary.
   - **Output**: The binary representation of the integer `n`.

   **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
   - `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the iostream library which is used for input and output operations.
   - `using namespace std;`: This line allows us to use standard library functions and objects without prefixing them with `std::`.
   - `void decToBinary(int n)`: This line declares a function `decToBinary` that takes an integer `n` as input.
   - `int binaryNum[32];`: This line declares an array `binaryNum` of size 32 to store the binary digits.
   - `int i = 0;`: This line initializes a counter `i` to 0.
   - `while (n > 0) { ... }`: This loop continues until `n` becomes 0. Inside the loop:
     - `binaryNum[i] = n % 2;`: This line calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 (either 0 or 1) and stores it in the `binaryNum` array at index `i`.
     - `n = n / 2;`: This line updates `n` by performing integer division by 2.
     - `i++;`: This line increments the counter `i`.
   - `for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) { ... }`: This loop prints the binary digits in reverse order from the last calculated index `i-1` to 0.
     - `cout << binaryNum[j];`: This line prints the binary digit stored in `binaryNum[j]`.
   - `int main() { ... }`: This is the main function where the program execution begins.
     - `int n = 10;`: This line initializes `n` with the value 10.
     - `decToBinary(n);`: This line calls the `decToBinary` function passing `n` as an argument.
     - `return 0;`: This line returns 0 indicating successful execution.

4. **SystemC Code Snippet**:
   Below is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that converts a decimal number to binary using the provided signals `dec_in` and `binary_out`.

   ```cpp
   #include <systemc.h>

   // Module to convert decimal to binary
   SC_MODULE(DecToBin) {
       sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for the decimal number
       sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for the binary number

       // Constructor
       SC_CTOR(DecToBin) {
           // Process to perform conversion
           SC_METHOD(convert);
           sensitive << dec_in;
       }

       // Method to convert decimal to binary
       void convert() {
           int n = dec_in.read();
           int binaryNum[32];
           int i = 0;

           while (n > 0) {
               binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
               n = n / 2;
               i++;
           }

           // Assuming binary_out is a vector or similar structure to hold the binary digits
           // Here, we'll just print the binary digits for demonstration purposes
           for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
               cout << binaryNum[j];
           }
           cout << endl; // Newline for better readability
       }
   };
   ```

   **Explanation of SystemC Code**:
   - The SystemC module `DecToBin` is defined with two ports: `dec_in` for input and `binary_out` for output.
   - The `convert` method is triggered whenever `dec_in` changes.
   - Inside `convert`, the decimal number is read from `dec_in`, and the conversion process is identical to the original C++ code.
   - For simplicity, the binary digits are printed to the console. In a real-world scenario, you might want to store the binary digits in `binary_out` or another suitable data structure, depending on your requirements and the capabilities of your SystemC environment.
