   - **Inputs**: The code takes three inputs: `principal`, `rate`, and `time`.
   - **Outputs**: The code calculates and outputs the compound interest (`CI`).

2. **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - These lines include all standard libraries and use the standard namespace, which is common for C++ programs.

   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;
   ```
   - The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
   - Three variables are declared and initialized: `principal` to 10000, `rate` to 5, and `time` to 2.

   ```cpp
       double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));
   ```
   - This line calculates the amount `A` after `time` years using the formula for compound interest: \( A = P \times (1 + r)^t \), where \( P \) is the principal, \( r \) is the rate, and \( t \) is the time.

   ```cpp
       double CI = A - principal;
   ```
   - This line calculates the compound interest `CI` by subtracting the principal from the amount `A`.

   ```cpp
       cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;
   ```
   - This line prints the calculated compound interest.

   ```cpp
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function returns 0, indicating successful execution.

3. **SystemC Code Snippet**:
   Below is the equivalent SystemC code that captures the same logic as the provided C++/C code:

   ```cpp
   #include <systemc.h>

   SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
       sc_in<double> principal;
       sc_in<double> rate;
       sc_in<double> time;
       sc_out<double> ci;

       void calculate() {
           // Calculate compound interest
           double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
           double CI = A - principal.read();
           ci.write(CI);
       }

       SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
           SC_METHOD(calculate);
           sensitive << principal << rate << time;
       }
   };

   int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
       CompoundInterestCalculator cic("cic");
       sc_signal<double> principal_sig, rate_sig, time_sig, ci_sig;

       // Example input values
       principal_sig.write(10000);
       rate_sig.write(5);
       time_sig.write(2);

       cic.principal(principal_sig);
       cic.rate(rate_sig);
       cic.time(time_sig);
       cic.ci(ci_sig);

       sc_start();

       cout << "Compound interest is " << ci_sig.read() << endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

4. **Explanation of SystemC Code**:
   - The `CompoundInterestCalculator` module is defined, which includes input ports `principal`, `rate`, and `time`, and an output port `ci`.
   - The `calculate` method computes the compound interest using the same formula as the C++ code.
   - The `SC_CTOR` constructor sets up the `calculate` method to be sensitive to changes in the input ports.
   - In `sc_main`, an instance of `CompoundInterestCalculator` is created, and input signals are initialized and connected to the module's ports.
   - The simulation is started with `sc_start()`, and the result is printed to the console.
