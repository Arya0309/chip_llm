   - **Inputs**: A 4x4 matrix `A`.
   - **Outputs**: A 4x4 matrix `B` which is the transpose of matrix `A`.

5. **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
   - **Lines 1-4**: Include necessary headers and use the standard namespace.
   - **Line 6**: Define a constant `N` set to 4, indicating the size of the square matrix.
   - **Lines 9-13**: Declare a function `transpose` that takes two 4x4 matrices `A` and `B` as arguments. It iterates through each element of `A` and assigns the transposed value to `B`.
   - **Lines 16-20**: In the `main` function, declare and initialize a 4x4 matrix `A` with predefined values.
   - **Lines 22-23**: Declare a 4x4 matrix `B` to store the result.
   - **Line 25**: Call the `transpose` function to compute the transpose of `A` and store it in `B`.
   - **Lines 27-34**: Print the elements of matrix `B` to the console, formatted as a matrix.
   - **Line 36**: Return 0 to indicate successful execution.

6. **SystemC Code**:
   Below is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that captures the same logic as the provided C++ code. It uses the `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals for matrix input and output, respectively.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixTranspose) {
    sc_in<int> A[16]; // Input matrix A (flattened)
    sc_out<int> B[16]; // Output matrix B (flattened)

    SC_CTOR(MatrixTranspose) {
        SC_METHOD(transpose);
        sensitive << A[0] << A[1] << A[2] << A[3] << A[4] << A[5] << A[6] << A[7] << A[8] << A[9] << A[10] << A[11] << A[12] << A[13] << A[14] << A[15];
    }

    void transpose() {
        int B_local[4][4]; // Local copy of B for computation
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
                B_local[i][j] = A[j * 4 + i].read(); // Read from input and transpose
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
                B[i * 4 + j].write(B_local[i][j]); // Write to output
            }
        }
    }
};
```

**Explanation of SystemC Code**:
- **Lines 1-3**: Include the SystemC header file.
- **Lines 5-13**: Define a SystemC module `MatrixTranspose` with input (`sc_in`) and output (`sc_out`) ports. The ports are arrays of size 16 to represent the flattened 4x4 matrices.
- **Line 15**: The constructor initializes the `transpose` method, making it sensitive to changes in any of the input elements.
- **Lines 17-27**: The `transpose` method performs the matrix transposition. It reads values from the input ports, computes the transpose, and writes the results to the output ports.
- **Line 29**: The `main` function would instantiate this module and connect it to a testbench, but it is not shown here as it is assumed to be part of the larger testbench setup.

This SystemC code can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow and will behave similarly to the original C++ code, performing the matrix transposition operation.
