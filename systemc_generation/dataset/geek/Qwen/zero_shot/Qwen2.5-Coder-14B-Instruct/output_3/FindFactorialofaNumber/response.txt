   - Input: The input to the program is a single unsigned integer, `n`, which represents the number for which the factorial is to be calculated. This value is hardcoded as `5` in the provided C++ code.
   - Output: The output is the factorial of the input number, which is printed to the console.

2. **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
   - `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the iostream library, which is used for input and output operations.
   - `using namespace std;`: This line allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.
   - `unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)`: This line defines a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as an argument and returns an unsigned integer.
     - `int res = 1, i;`: Initializes two variables, `res` to store the result of the factorial calculation and `i` as a loop counter.
     - `for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)`: A for loop that starts from `2` and goes up to `n`, inclusive.
       - `res *= i;`: Multiplies `res` by `i` in each iteration, effectively calculating the factorial.
     - `return res;`: Returns the computed factorial value.
   - `int main()`: The main function where the execution of the program begins.
     - `int num = 5;`: Declares and initializes a variable `num` with the value `5`.
     - `cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;`: Prints the factorial of `num` to the console.
     - `return 0;`: Indicates successful termination of the program.

3. **SystemC Code Snippet**:
   Below is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source and integrates with the provided signals:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(FactorialModule) {
    // Input and output ports
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;
    sc_out<unsigned int> out;

    // Process to compute factorial
    void compute_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read();
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(FactorialModule) {
        SC_METHOD(compute_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // Instantiate the module
    FactorialModule factorial_module("factorial_module");

    // Testbench signals
    sc_signal<unsigned int> in_signal;
    sc_signal<unsigned int> out_signal;

    // Connect signals to module
    factorial_module.in(in_signal);
    factorial_module.out(out_signal);

    // Initialize input signal
    in_signal = 5;

    // Run simulation
    sc_start();

    // Output the result
    cout << "Factorial of 5 is " << out_signal.read() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of SystemC Code**:
- **Module Declaration**: `SC_MODULE(FactorialModule)` declares a SystemC module named `FactorialModule`.
- **Ports**: `sc_in<unsigned int> in;` and `sc_out<unsigned int> out;` define the input and output ports of the module.
- **Compute Factorial Method**: `void compute_factorial()` is a method within the module that calculates the factorial of the input value.
  - It reads the input value from the `in` port.
  - It computes the factorial using a for loop similar to the C++ code.
  - It writes the result to the `out` port.
- **Constructor**: `SC_CTOR(FactorialModule)` is the constructor of the module where the `compute_factorial` method is registered as a sensitive process to changes in the `in` port.
- **Main Function**: `int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[])` is the entry point of the SystemC simulation.
  - It instantiates the `FactorialModule`.
  - It creates and connects testbench signals to the module's ports.
  - It initializes the input signal with the value `5`.
  - It runs the simulation and prints the result from the output signal.
