   - **Inputs**: The C++ code takes three inputs: `principal`, `rate`, and `time`. These are hardcoded within the `main` function.
   - **Outputs**: The code outputs the compound interest (`CI`), which is calculated and printed to the console.

2. **Detailed Explanation**:
   - The program starts by including necessary headers and using the standard namespace.
   - The `main` function initializes three variables: `principal`, `rate`, and `time` with values 10000, 5, and 2 respectively.
   - It then calculates the amount `A` after applying compound interest using the formula \( A = P \times (1 + \frac{r}{100})^t \), where `P` is the principal, `r` is the rate, and `t` is the time.
   - The compound interest (`CI`) is computed by subtracting the principal from the amount `A`.
   - Finally, the program prints the compound interest to the console.

3. **SystemC Code**:
   Below is the equivalent SystemC code that uses the provided signals for input and output:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
    sc_in<double> principal;  // Input signal for principal amount
    sc_in<double> rate;       // Input signal for interest rate
    sc_in<double> time;       // Input signal for time period
    sc_out<double> ci;        // Output signal for compound interest

    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
        SC_METHOD(calculate);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;  // Sensitivity list
    }

    void calculate() {
        // Calculate compound interest
        double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
        double CI = A - principal.read();
        
        // Write the result to the output signal
        ci.write(CI);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **Module Declaration**: The `CompoundInterestCalculator` module is declared using `SC_MODULE`.
- **Signals**: Three input signals (`principal`, `rate`, `time`) and one output signal (`ci`) are declared.
- **Constructor**: The constructor sets up the sensitivity list for the `calculate` method, ensuring it runs whenever any of the input signals change.
- **Calculate Method**: This method performs the same calculations as the original C++ code:
  - It reads the values from the input signals.
  - It computes the amount `A` and then the compound interest `CI`.
  - It writes the result to the `ci` output signal.

This SystemC code can be integrated into a larger design and tested using the provided input and output signals.
