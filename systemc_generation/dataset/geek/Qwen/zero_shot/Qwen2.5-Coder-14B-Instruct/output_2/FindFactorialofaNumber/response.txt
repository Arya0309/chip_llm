- **Input**: The input to the program is a number for which the factorial needs to be calculated. In the provided C++ code, this number is hardcoded as `5`.
- **Output**: The output of the program is the factorial of the input number. For the input `5`, the output would be `120`.

**Line-by-Line Explanation**:
1. `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the iostream library, which is used for input and output operations.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.
3. `unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)`: This line declares a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as an argument and returns an unsigned integer.
4. `int res = 1, i;`: This line initializes two variables, `res` to `1` and `i` to an uninitialized value.
5. `for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)`: This line starts a for loop that iterates from `2` to `n` inclusive.
6. `res *= i;`: Inside the loop, this line multiplies `res` by the current value of `i`.
7. `return res;`: After the loop completes, this line returns the computed factorial value stored in `res`.
8. `int main()`: This line declares the main function where the execution of the program begins.
9. `int num = 5;`: This line initializes a variable `num` with the value `5`.
10. `cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;`: This line prints the message "Factorial of 5 is" followed by the result of the factorial function call.
11. `return 0;`: This line indicates successful termination of the program.

**SystemC Code Snippet**:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(FactorialModule) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;
    sc_out<unsigned int> out;

    void compute_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read();
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }

    SC_CTOR(FactorialModule) {
        SC_METHOD(compute_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    FactorialModule fm("fm");
    sc_signal<unsigned int> in_signal, out_signal;

    fm.in(in_signal);
    fm.out(out_signal);

    // Example input
    in_signal = 5;

    sc_start();

    cout << "Factorial of " << in_signal.read() << " is " << out_signal.read() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of SystemC Code**:
1. `#include <systemc.h>`: This line includes the SystemC library.
2. `SC_MODULE(FactorialModule)`: This line defines a SystemC module named `FactorialModule`.
3. `sc_in<unsigned int> in;` and `sc_out<unsigned int> out;`: These lines declare input and output ports for the module.
4. `void compute_factorial()`: This method computes the factorial of the input number.
5. `unsigned int n = in.read();`: This line reads the input value from the `in` port.
6. `unsigned int res = 1;`: This line initializes the result variable to `1`.
7. `for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++)`: This loop calculates the factorial by multiplying `res` by each integer from `2` to `n`.
8. `out.write(res);`: This line writes the computed factorial to the `out` port.
9. `SC_CTOR(FactorialModule)`: This constructor sets up the `compute_factorial` method to be triggered whenever the `in` port changes.
10. `sc_main(int argc, char* argv[])`: This is the main function for SystemC simulation.
11. `FactorialModule fm("fm");`: This line creates an instance of the `FactorialModule`.
12. `sc_signal<unsigned int> in_signal, out_signal;`: These lines declare signals for connecting the module ports.
13. `fm.in(in_signal);` and `fm.out(out_signal);`: These lines connect the module ports to the signals.
14. `in_signal = 5;`: This line sets the input signal to `5`.
15. `sc_start();`: This line starts the SystemC simulation.
16. `cout << "Factorial of " << in_signal.read() << " is " << out_signal.read() << endl;`: This line prints the result of the factorial computation.
