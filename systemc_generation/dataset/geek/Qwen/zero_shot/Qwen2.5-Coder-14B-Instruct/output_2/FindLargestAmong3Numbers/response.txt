   - `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the iostream library which is used for input and output operations in C++.
   - `using namespace std;`: This line allows us to use standard library functions without specifying the `std::` prefix.
   - `int main() {`: This marks the beginning of the main function where the execution of the program starts.
   - `int a = 1, b = 2, c = 11;`: Here, three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared and initialized with values 1, 2, and 11 respectively.
   - `if (a >= b) {`: This conditional statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
     - `if (a >= c)` : Nested conditional statement inside the first `if` block, checks if `a` is also greater than or equal to `c`.
       - `cout << a;`: If both conditions are true, this line prints the value of `a` as it is the largest.
     - `else`: This block executes if the condition `a >= c` is false.
       - `cout << c;`: This line prints the value of `c` as it is the largest.
   - `else`: This block executes if the initial condition `a >= b` is false.
     - `if (b >= c)`: Conditional statement inside the second `else` block, checks if `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
       - `cout << b;`: If true, this line prints the value of `b` as it is the largest.
     - `else`: This block executes if the condition `b >= c` is false.
       - `cout << c;`: This line prints the value of `c` as it is the largest.
   - `return 0;`: This statement indicates successful termination of the program.

4. **SystemC Code Snippet**:

   Below is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that replicates the functionality of the given C++ code. It uses the provided signals (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `largest`) for input and output.

   ```cpp
   #include <systemc.h>

   SC_MODULE(FindLargest) {
       sc_in<int> a;
       sc_in<int> b;
       sc_in<int> c;
       sc_out<int> largest;

       void find_largest() {
           wait(); // Wait for a clock cycle to ensure inputs are stable

           if (a.read() >= b.read()) {
               if (a.read() >= c.read())
                   largest.write(a.read());
               else
                   largest.write(c.read());
           } else {
               if (b.read() >= c.read())
                   largest.write(b.read());
               else
                   largest.write(c.read());
           }
       }

       SC_CTOR(FindLargest) {
           SC_THREAD(find_largest);
       }
   };

   int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
       FindLargest find_largest("find_largest");

       sc_start();

       return 0;
   }
   ```

5. **Explanation of the SystemC Code**:

   - `#include <systemc.h>`: This line includes the SystemC library.
   - `SC_MODULE(FindLargest) { ... }`: Defines a SystemC module named `FindLargest`.
   - `sc_in<int> a;`, `sc_in<int> b;`, `sc_in<int> c;`, `sc_out<int> largest;`: Declare input and output ports.
   - `void find_largest() { ... }`: A member function that implements the logic to find the largest number among `a`, `b`, and `c`.
     - `wait();`: Waits for a clock cycle to ensure that the input values are stable before proceeding.
     - `if (a.read() >= b.read()) { ... }`: Checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
       - `if (a.read() >= c.read())`: Checks if `a` is also greater than or equal to `c`.
         - `largest.write(a.read());`: Writes the value of `a` to the `largest` port.
       - `else`: If `a` is not greater than or equal to `c`.
         - `largest.write(c.read());`: Writes the value of `c` to the `largest` port.
     - `else`: If `a` is not greater than or equal to `b`.
       - `if (b.read() >= c.read())`: Checks if `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
         - `largest.write(b.read());`: Writes the value of `b` to the `largest` port.
       - `else`: If `b` is not greater than or equal to `c`.
         - `largest.write(c.read());`: Writes the value of `c` to the `largest` port.
   - `SC_CTOR(FindLargest) { SC_THREAD(find_largest); }`: Constructor of the module that registers `find_largest` as a thread process.
   - `int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) { ... }`: The entry point of the SystemC simulation.
     - `FindLargest find_largest("find_largest");`: Instantiates the `FindLargest` module.
     - `sc_start();`: Starts the SystemC simulation.

This SystemC code snippet accurately replicates the logic of the original C++ code while adhering to the requirements for input and output signals.
