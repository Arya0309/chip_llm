   - **Input**: An integer `n` which is the number to be checked for primality.
   - **Output**: A boolean indicating whether the number `n` is prime (`true` if it is prime, `false` otherwise).

3. **Line-by-Line Summary**:
   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes standard libraries and uses the `std` namespace for convenience.

   ```cpp
   int main() {
       int n = 29;
   ```
   - The main function starts, and an integer `n` is initialized to 29.

   ```cpp
       int cnt = 0;
   ```
   - A counter `cnt` is initialized to 0. This counter will be used to count the number of divisors of `n`.

   ```cpp
       // If number is less than/equal to 1,
       // it is not prime
       if (n <= 1)
           cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;
   ```
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not a prime number, and the program outputs this fact.

   ```cpp
       else {
   ```
   - Otherwise, the program proceeds to check for divisors.

   ```cpp
           // Check for divisors from 1 to n
           for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
   ```
   - A loop iterates over all integers from 1 to `n`.

   ```cpp
               // Check how many number is divisible
               // by n
               if (n % i == 0)
                   cnt++;
   ```
   - Inside the loop, if `i` divides `n` without a remainder, the counter `cnt` is incremented.

   ```cpp
           }
   ```
   - The loop ends after checking all numbers from 1 to `n`.

   ```cpp
           // If n is divisible by more than 2 numbers
           // then it is not prime
           if (cnt > 2)
               cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;
   ```
   - If the counter `cnt` is greater than 2, `n` has more than two divisors, and thus it is not a prime number.

   ```cpp
           // else it is prime
           else
               cout << n << " is prime" << endl;
   ```
   - If `cnt` is 2 or less, `n` is a prime number.

   ```cpp
       }
   ```
   - The else block ends.

   ```cpp
       return 0;
   ```
   - The main function returns 0, indicating successful execution.

4. **SystemC Code**:
   - The following SystemC code implements the same logic using the provided `sc_in<int> n` and `sc_out<bool> is_prime` signals.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<bool> is_prime;

    void check_prime() {
        int cnt = 0;

        // If number is less than/equal to 1,
        // it is not prime
        if (n.read() <= 1) {
            is_prime.write(false);
        } else {
            // Check for divisors from 1 to n
            for (int i = 1; i <= n.read(); i++) {
                // Check how many number is divisible
                // by n
                if (n.read() % i == 0) {
                    cnt++;
                }
            }

            // If n is divisible by more than 2 numbers
            // then it is not prime
            if (cnt > 2) {
                is_prime.write(false);
            } else {
                // else it is prime
                is_prime.write(true);
            }
        }
    }

    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        SC_METHOD(check_prime);
        sensitive << n;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **Module Definition**: The `PrimeChecker` module is defined, containing the input `n` and output `is_prime`.
- **Method Declaration**: The `check_prime` method is declared to perform the primality check.
- **Counter Initialization**: A counter `cnt` is initialized to 0.
- **Condition Check**: If `n` is less than or equal to 1, `is_prime` is set to `false`.
- **Loop for Divisors**: A loop checks each number from 1 to `n` to see if it divides `n` without a remainder, incrementing `cnt` if it does.
- **Final Check**: If `cnt` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is set to `false`; otherwise, it is set to `true`.
- **Constructor**: The constructor sets up the `check_prime` method to be sensitive to changes in `n`.
