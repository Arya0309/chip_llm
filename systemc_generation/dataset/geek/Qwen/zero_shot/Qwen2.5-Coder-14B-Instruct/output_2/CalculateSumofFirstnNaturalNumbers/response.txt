!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - **Input**: The input is an integer `n` which represents the number of natural numbers whose sum is to be calculated.
   - **Output**: The output is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

2. **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
   - `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the iostream library which is used for input and output operations.
   - `using namespace std;`: This line allows the use of standard library functions and objects without the need to prefix them with `std::`.
   - `int findSum(int n)`: This line declares a function `findSum` that takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns an integer.
   - `{`: This opening brace starts the body of the `findSum` function.
   - `int sum = 0;`: This line initializes an integer variable `sum` to 0. This variable will store the cumulative sum of the natural numbers.
   - `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)`: This line starts a for loop that iterates from 1 to `n` inclusive. The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `sum = sum + i;`: Inside the loop, this line adds the current value of `i` to `sum`.
   - `}`: This closing brace ends the body of the `findSum` function.
   - `return sum;`: This line returns the final value of `sum`, which is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - `}`: This closing brace ends the definition of the `findSum` function.
   - `int main()`: This line declares the main function where the execution of the program begins.
   - `{`: This opening brace starts the body of the `main` function.
   - `int n = 5;`: This line initializes an integer variable `n` to 5. This is the number of natural numbers whose sum is to be calculated.
   - `cout << findSum(n);`: This line calls the `findSum` function with `n` as the argument and prints the result to the standard output.
   - `return 0;`: This line returns 0 to indicate successful termination of the program.
   - `}`: This closing brace ends the body of the `main` function.

3. **SystemC Code Snippet**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SumCalculator) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> n;
    sc_out<unsigned int> result;

    void calculate_sum() {
        unsigned int sum = 0;
        for (unsigned int i = 1; i <= n.read(); i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        result.write(sum);
    }

    SC_CTOR(SumCalculator) {
        SC_METHOD(calculate_sum);
        sensitive << n;
    }
};
```

**Explanation of SystemC Code**:
- `SC_MODULE(SumCalculator)`: This line defines a SystemC module named `SumCalculator`.
- `sc_in<unsigned int> n;` and `sc_out<unsigned int> result;`: These lines declare input and output ports `n` and `result` respectively, which correspond to the provided signals.
- `void calculate_sum()`: This line declares a method `calculate_sum` that performs the summation of the first `n` natural numbers.
- `unsigned int sum = 0;`: This line initializes an unsigned integer variable `sum` to 0.
- `for (unsigned int i = 1; i <= n.read(); i++)`: This line starts a for loop that iterates from 1 to the value of `n`. The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- `sum += i;`: Inside the loop, this line adds the current value of `i` to `sum`.
- `result.write(sum);`: This line writes the final value of `sum` to the output port `result`.
- `SC_CTOR(SumCalculator)`: This line defines the constructor for the `SumCalculator` module.
- `SC_METHOD(calculate_sum);`: This line registers the `calculate_sum` method as a SystemC method.
- `sensitive << n;`: This line makes the `calculate_sum` method sensitive to changes in the input port `n`.

This SystemC code snippet replicates the logic of the original C++/C code and integrates with the provided signals for testbench integration.
