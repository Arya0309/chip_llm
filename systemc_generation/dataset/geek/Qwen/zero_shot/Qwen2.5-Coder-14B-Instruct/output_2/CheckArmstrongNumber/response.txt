   - `int n = 153;`: This line initializes an integer variable `n` with the value 153, which is the number to be checked if it is an Armstrong number.
   - `int temp = n;`: Another integer variable `temp` is initialized with the value of `n`. This is done to keep a copy of the original number for later comparison.
   - `int p = 0;`: An integer variable `p` is initialized to 0. This will store the sum of the cubes of each digit of `n`.
   - `while (n > 0) { ... }`: This while loop runs as long as `n` is greater than 0. Inside the loop:
     - `int rem = n % 10;`: This calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10, effectively extracting the last digit of `n`.
     - `p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);`: This adds the cube of the extracted digit (`rem`) to `p`.
     - `n = n / 10;`: This removes the last digit from `n` by performing integer division by 10.
   - `if (temp == p) { ... } else { ... }`: After the loop, this conditional statement checks if the sum of the cubes of the digits (`p`) is equal to the original number (`temp`).
     - If true, it prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No."
     - If false, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No."

4. **SystemC Code**:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in; // Input signal
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong; // Output signal

    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        SC_METHOD(checkArmstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    void checkArmstrong() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        if (temp == p) {
            is_armstrong.write(true);
        } else {
            is_armstrong.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

**Explanation of SystemC Code**:

- **Module Declaration**: The `ArmstrongChecker` module is declared using `SC_MODULE`, which encapsulates the functionality of checking if a number is an Armstrong number.
- **Input and Output Ports**: The module has two ports: `num_in` for input and `is_armstrong` for output. These are defined as `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<bool>`, respectively.
- **Constructor**: The constructor initializes the `checkArmstrong` method as a sensitive process to the `num_in` port. This means the method will execute whenever `num_in` changes.
- **Method Definition**: The `checkArmstrong` method performs the same logic as the original C++ code:
  - It reads the input number from `num_in`.
  - It initializes `temp` and `p` similarly.
  - It uses a while loop to calculate the sum of the cubes of the digits.
  - It compares `temp` with `p` and writes the result to `is_armstrong`.

This SystemC code can be integrated into a testbench that provides values to `num_in` and checks the output from `is_armstrong`.
