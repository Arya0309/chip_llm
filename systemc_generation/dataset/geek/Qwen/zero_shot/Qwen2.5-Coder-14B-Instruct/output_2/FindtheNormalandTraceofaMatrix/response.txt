!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!2. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - **Input**: A 2D array `mat` of integers, which represents the matrix. The size of this matrix is `n x n`.
   - **Outputs**: Two integer values:
     - `trace`: The sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix.
     - `norm`: The square root of the sum of the squares of all elements in the matrix.

3. **Detailed Explanation**:
   - **Line 1-6**: Include necessary headers and use the standard namespace.
   - **Line 9**: Define a constant `MAX` set to 100, which could be the maximum size of the matrix.
   - **Line 12-18**: Define the function `findNormal` which calculates the normal of the matrix. It takes a 2D array `mat` and its size `n` as parameters. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0. It then iterates over each element of the matrix, squaring each element and adding it to `sum`. Finally, it returns the square root of `sum`.
   - **Line 21-27**: Define the function `findTrace` which calculates the trace of the matrix. It also takes a 2D array `mat` and its size `n` as parameters. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0. It then iterates over the diagonal elements of the matrix (where the row index equals the column index), adding each diagonal element to `sum`. Finally, it returns `sum`.
   - **Line 30-38**: The `main` function initializes a 5x5 matrix `mat` with specific values. It then prints the trace and normal of the matrix by calling `findTrace` and `findNormal` respectively.

4. **SystemC Code Snippet**:
   ```
   #include <systemc.h>
   #include <cmath>

   SC_MODULE(MatrixOperations) {
       sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];
       sc_out<int> trace;
       sc_out<int> norm;

       void compute() {
           int sum_trace = 0;
           int sum_norm = 0;
           for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
               sum_trace += matrix[i*SIZE + i].read();
               for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                   int val = matrix[i*SIZE + j].read();
                   sum_norm += val * val;
               }
           }
           trace.write(sum_trace);
           norm.write(sqrt(sum_norm));
       }

       SC_CTOR(MatrixOperations) {
           SC_THREAD(compute);
       }
   };
   ```

   **Explanation of SystemC Code**:
   - **Line 1-3**: Include necessary headers and define the module `MatrixOperations`.
   - **Line 5-6**: Declare input and output ports `matrix`, `trace`, and `norm`.
   - **Line 8-24**: Define the `compute` method which performs the operations similar to the C++ code. It initializes `sum_trace` and `sum_norm` to 0. It then iterates over the matrix elements, calculating the trace and norm. The results are written to the `trace` and `norm` output ports.
   - **Line 26-27**: Constructor for the module, which starts the `compute` thread when the module is instantiated.

This SystemC code snippet captures the logic of the original C++ code, using SystemC's dataflow and concurrency features to perform the required calculations on the matrix.
