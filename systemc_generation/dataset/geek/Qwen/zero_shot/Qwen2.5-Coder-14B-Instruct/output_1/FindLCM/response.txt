   - **Inputs**: Two integers, `a` and `b`, which are the numbers for which the Least Common Multiple (LCM) is to be calculated.
   - **Output**: The LCM of the two input integers, printed to the console.

3. **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
   - `int a = 15, b = 20, max_num, flag = 1;`: Initializes three integer variables. `a` and `b` are set to 15 and 20 respectively, representing the two numbers whose LCM needs to be found. `max_num` is initialized to store the maximum of the two numbers, and `flag` is set to 1 to control the while loop.
   - `max_num = (a > b) ? a : b;`: Uses the ternary operator to determine the larger of the two numbers (`a` or `b`) and assigns it to `max_num`.
   - `while (flag) {`: Starts an infinite loop controlled by the `flag` variable. The loop continues until a break statement is encountered.
   - `if (max_num % a == 0 && max_num % b == 0) {`: Checks if `max_num` is divisible by both `a` and `b` without any remainder.
     - `cout << "LCM of " << a << " and " << b << " is " << max_num;`: If the condition is true, it prints the LCM of `a` and `b`.
     - `break;`: Exits the while loop once the LCM is found.
   - `++max_num;`: Increments `max_num` by 1 on each iteration of the loop.
   - `return 0;`: Ends the `main` function and returns 0, indicating successful execution.

4. **SystemC Code**:
   Below is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that captures the logic of the provided C++/C code. It uses the signals `a`, `b`, and `lcm_result` as specified.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LCMCalculator) {
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;
    sc_out<int> lcm_result;

    SC_CTOR(LCMCalculator) {
        SC_THREAD(find_lcm);
    }

    void find_lcm() {
        int max_num, flag = 1;

        // Use ternary operator to get the large number
        max_num = (a.read() > b.read()) ? a.read() : b.read();

        while (flag) {
            // if statement checks max_num is completely divisible by a and b.
            if (max_num % a.read() == 0 && max_num % b.read() == 0) {
                lcm_result.write(max_num);
                flag = 0; // Exit the loop after finding the LCM
            }

            // update by 1 on each iteration
            ++max_num;
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **Module Declaration**: `SC_MODULE(LCMCalculator)` declares a SystemC module named `LCMCalculator`.
- **Signals**: `sc_in<int> a;`, `sc_in<int> b;`, and `sc_out<int> lcm_result;` declare the input and output signals.
- **Constructor**: `SC_CTOR(LCMCalculator) { SC_THREAD(find_lcm); }` initializes the module and starts the `find_lcm` thread.
- **Thread Function**: `void find_lcm()` contains the logic to find the LCM.
  - `int max_num, flag = 1;` initializes variables similar to the C++ code.
  - `max_num = (a.read() > b.read()) ? a.read() : b.read();` determines the larger of the two input numbers.
  - The `while (flag)` loop checks if `max_num` is divisible by both `a` and `b`. If true, it writes the LCM to `lcm_result` and sets `flag` to 0 to exit the loop.
  - `++max_num;` increments `max_num` in each iteration.

This SystemC code can be integrated into a testbench using the provided signals, allowing it to be synthesized and simulated in a high-level synthesis flow.
