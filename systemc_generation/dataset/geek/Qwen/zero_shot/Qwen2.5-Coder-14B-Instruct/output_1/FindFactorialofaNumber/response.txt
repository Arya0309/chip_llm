1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - **Input**: The input to the program is a single unsigned integer `num` which is hardcoded to 5 in the `main` function.
   - **Output**: The output is the factorial of the input number, printed to the console.

2. **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
   - `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the iostream library, which is necessary for input and output operations.
   - `using namespace std;`: This line allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.
   - `unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)`: This line declares a function `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as input and returns an unsigned integer.
     - `int res = 1, i;`: This line initializes two variables, `res` (result) to 1 and `i` (iterator) to an unspecified value.
     - `for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)`: This line starts a for loop that iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive).
       - `res *= i;`: Inside the loop, this line multiplies `res` by `i`, effectively calculating the factorial.
     - `return res;`: After the loop completes, this line returns the calculated factorial.
   - `int main()`: This line defines the main function, which is the entry point of the program.
     - `int num = 5;`: This line initializes the variable `num` to 5.
     - `cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;`: This line prints the result of the factorial calculation to the console.
     - `return 0;`: This line indicates that the program executed successfully.

**SystemC Code Equivalent**

The following SystemC code snippet captures the same logic as the provided C++/C code. It uses the provided `in` and `out` signals for input and output.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(FactorialModule) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;
    sc_out<unsigned int> out;

    void compute_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read();
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }

    SC_CTOR(FactorialModule) {
        SC_METHOD(compute_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    sc_signal<unsigned int> in_signal;
    sc_signal<unsigned int> out_signal;

    FactorialModule fm("factorial_module");
    fm.in(in_signal);
    fm.out(out_signal);

    // Testbench
    in_signal = 5; // Set input to 5
    sc_start();    // Start simulation

    cout << "Factorial of 5 is " << out_signal.read() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of the SystemC Code**:

1. **Module Declaration**:
   - `SC_MODULE(FactorialModule)`: This line declares a SystemC module named `FactorialModule`.
   - `sc_in<unsigned int> in;` and `sc_out<unsigned int> out;`: These lines declare input and output ports for the module.

2. **Method Definition**:
   - `void compute_factorial()`: This method reads the input value, computes the factorial, and writes the result to the output port.
     - `unsigned int n = in.read();`: This line reads the input value from the `in` port.
     - `unsigned int res = 1;`: This line initializes the result variable to 1.
     - `for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++)`: This line starts a for loop that iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive).
       - `res *= i;`: Inside the loop, this line multiplies `res` by `i`, effectively calculating the factorial.
     - `out.write(res);`: After the loop completes, this line writes the calculated factorial to the `out` port.

3. **Constructor**:
   - `SC_CTOR(FactorialModule)`: This line defines the constructor for the `FactorialModule`.
     - `SC_METHOD(compute_factorial);`: This line registers the `compute_factorial` method as a SystemC method.
     - `sensitive << in;`: This line makes the `compute_factorial` method sensitive to changes in the `in` port.

4. **Main Function**:
   - `sc_signal<unsigned int> in_signal;` and `sc_signal<unsigned int> out_signal;`: These lines declare signals for input and output.
   - `FactorialModule fm("factorial_module");`: This line creates an instance of the `FactorialModule`.
   - `fm.in(in_signal);` and `fm.out(out_signal);`: These lines bind the signals to the module's input and output ports.
   - `in_signal = 5;`: This line sets the input signal to 5.
   - `sc_start();`: This line starts the SystemC simulation.
   - `cout << "Factorial of 5 is " << out_signal.read() << endl;`: This line prints the result of the factorial calculation to the console.

This SystemC code faithfully replicates the logic of the original C++/C code and integrates seamlessly with the provided testbench signals.
