    "explanation": "The SystemC code defines a module `LeapYearChecker` with two ports: `year` for input and `is_leap_year` for output. The `check` method contains the logic to determine if the input year is a leap year, similar to the `checkYear` function in the C++ code. The `SC_METHOD` directive is used to specify that the `check` method should be executed whenever the `year` port changes. The `sensitive << year;` line ensures that the `check` method is triggered by changes to the `year` port."
