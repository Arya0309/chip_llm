   - **Inputs**: A 2D array `A` of size `N x N` where `N` is defined as 4 in this case. This array contains the original matrix whose transpose needs to be computed.
   - **Outputs**: A 2D array `B` of size `N x N` which will store the transpose of the matrix `A`.

5. **Line-by-Line Explanation**:
   - `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: Includes all standard libraries, which is not recommended for production code due to bloat but useful for quick prototyping.
   - `using namespace std;`: Brings all standard library functions and objects into the global namespace.
   - `#define N 4`: Defines a constant `N` set to 4, representing the dimension of the square matrices.
   - `void transpose(int A[][N], int B[][N])`: Function declaration for computing the transpose of matrix `A` and storing it in matrix `B`.
     - `int i, j;`: Declaration of loop variables.
     - Nested `for` loops iterate over each element of the matrix `A`.
       - `B[i][j] = A[j][i];`: Assigns the transposed value from `A` to `B`.
   - `int main()`: Main function where the program execution begins.
     - Initializes a 2D array `A` with predefined values.
     - Declares another 2D array `B` of the same size.
     - Calls the `transpose` function passing `A` and `B`.
     - Prints the elements of `B` to display the result matrix.
     - Returns 0 indicating successful execution.

6. **SystemC Code Snippet**:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixTranspose) {
    sc_in<int> A[SIZE];
    sc_out<int> B[SIZE];

    void compute_transpose() {
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                B[i*SIZE + j].write(A[j*SIZE + i].read());
            }
        }
    }

    SC_CTOR(MatrixTranspose) {
        SC_THREAD(compute_transpose);
    }
};
```

7. **Explanation of SystemC Code**:
   - `SC_MODULE(MatrixTranspose)`: Defines a SystemC module named `MatrixTranspose`.
   - `sc_in<int> A[SIZE];` and `sc_out<int> B[SIZE];`: Declare input and output ports for the module. These arrays represent the flattened versions of the 2D matrices `A` and `B`.
   - `void compute_transpose()`: Member function that performs the matrix transpose operation.
     - Nested `for` loops iterate over each element of the matrices.
       - `B[i*SIZE + j].write(A[j*SIZE + i].read());`: Reads the element from `A`, computes its transposed position, and writes it to `B`.
   - `SC_CTOR(MatrixTranspose) { SC_THREAD(compute_transpose); }`: Constructor for the module that creates a thread to execute the `compute_transpose` function.

This SystemC code snippet defines a module that takes a flattened 2D array `A` as input, computes its transpose, and outputs the result as a flattened 2D array `B`. It can be integrated seamlessly with an existing testbench using the provided signals.
