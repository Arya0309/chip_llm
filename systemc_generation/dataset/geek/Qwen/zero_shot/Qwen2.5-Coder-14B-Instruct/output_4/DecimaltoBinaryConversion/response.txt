The provided C++/C code is designed to convert a decimal number to its binary representation. Let's break down the code step by step:

### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input**: An integer `n` which is the decimal number to be converted.
- **Output**: The binary representation of the input decimal number, printed as a sequence of 0s and 1s.

### Line-by-Line Explanation:

1. ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the iostream library which is used for input and output operations and brings the standard namespace into scope.

2. ```cpp
   void decToBinary(int n)
   ```
   - This declares a function `decToBinary` that takes an integer `n` as an argument. The function is responsible for converting the decimal number to binary.

3. ```cpp
   int binaryNum[32];
   ```
   - An array `binaryNum` of size 32 is declared to store the binary digits of the number. The size 32 is chosen to accommodate the binary representation of a 32-bit integer.

4. ```cpp
   int i = 0;
   ```
   - An integer `i` is initialized to 0. It will be used as an index to store the binary digits in the `binaryNum` array.

5. ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
       n = n / 2;
       i++;
   }
   ```
   - A `while` loop runs as long as `n` is greater than 0. Inside the loop:
     - `binaryNum[i] = n % 2;` stores the remainder of `n` divided by 2 in the `binaryNum` array at index `i`. This remainder represents the least significant bit (LSB) of the binary number.
     - `n = n / 2;` updates `n` by performing integer division by 2, effectively shifting the number to the right by one bit.
     - `i++;` increments the index `i` to move to the next position in the `binaryNum` array.

6. ```cpp
   for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
       cout << binaryNum[j];
   ```
   - A `for` loop iterates from `i-1` down to 0. Inside the loop:
     - `cout << binaryNum[j];` prints the binary digits stored in the `binaryNum` array in reverse order, starting from the most significant bit (MSB) to the LSB.

7. ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int n = 10;
       decToBinary(n);
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function initializes an integer `n` with the value 10 and calls the `decToBinary` function to convert this number to binary. The function then returns 0, indicating successful execution.

### SystemC Equivalent Code:
Below is the equivalent SystemC code that performs the same functionality using the provided signals `dec_in` and `binary_out`.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DecimalToBinary) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in; // Input signal for decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output signal for binary number

    SC_CTOR(DecimalToBinary) {
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    void convert() {
        int n = dec_in.read();
        int binaryNum[32];
        int i = 0;

        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }

        // Convert binary array to a single integer
        int binary_result = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            binary_result = binary_result * 2 + binaryNum[j];
        }

        binary_out.write(binary_result);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    sc_signal<int> dec_in_signal;
    sc_signal<int> binary_out_signal;

    DecimalToBinary dtb("dtb");
    dtb.dec_in(dec_in_signal);
    dtb.binary_out(binary_out_signal);

    // Example test case
    dec_in_signal.write(10);
    sc_start();

    cout << "Binary representation of " << dec_in_signal.read() << " is " << binary_out_signal.read() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **Module Declaration**: `SC_MODULE(DecimalToBinary)` defines a SystemC module named `DecimalToBinary`.
- **Signals**: `sc_in<int> dec_in` and `sc_out<int> binary_out` are the input and output signals, respectively.
- **Constructor**: The constructor sets up a sensitivity to changes in `dec_in` and calls the `convert` method whenever `dec_in` changes.
- **Convert Method**: The `convert` method reads the input value from `dec_in`, performs the conversion to binary, and writes the result to `binary_out`.
- **Main Function**: Sets up the signals and module, writes a test value to `dec_in_signal`, starts the simulation, and prints the result.

This SystemC code replicates the functionality of the original C++ code, converting a decimal number to binary and outputting the result using SystemC signals.
