   - **Inputs**: The code takes three inputs: `principal`, `rate`, and `time`.
   - **Outputs**: The code calculates and outputs the compound interest (`CI`).

2. **Line-by-Line Analysis**:
   ```cpp
   // Include necessary libraries
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This section includes standard libraries and uses the standard namespace.

   ```cpp
   // Driver code
   int main()
   {
       double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;
   ```
   - The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
   - Variables `principal`, `rate`, and `time` are declared and initialized with values 10000, 5, and 2 respectively.

   ```cpp
       // Calculate compound interest
       double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));
       double CI = A - principal;
   ```
   - The formula for calculating the amount (`A`) after compound interest is applied is used: \( A = P \times (1 + r)^t \).
   - Here, `P` is the principal amount, `r` is the rate of interest per annum, and `t` is the time in years.
   - The compound interest (`CI`) is then calculated as the difference between the amount (`A`) and the principal (`principal`).

   ```cpp
       cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;
   ```
   - The result is printed to the console.

   ```cpp
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The program returns 0, indicating successful execution.

3. **SystemC Code Snippet**:
   Below is the equivalent SystemC code that captures the logic of the original C++/C source:

   ```cpp
   #include <systemc.h>

   SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
       sc_in<double> principal;
       sc_in<double> rate;
       sc_in<double> time;
       sc_out<double> ci;

       SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
           SC_METHOD(calculate);
           sensitive << principal << rate << time;
       }

       void calculate() {
           double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
           double CI = A - principal.read();
           ci.write(CI);
       }
   };

   int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
       CompoundInterestCalculator cic("cic");

       // Example inputs
       cic.principal.write(10000);
       cic.rate.write(5);
       cic.time.write(2);

       // Run the simulation
       sc_start();

       // Output the result
       cout << "Compound interest is " << cic.ci.read() << endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Explanation of SystemC Code**:
   - The `CompoundInterestCalculator` module is defined with input and output ports corresponding to the C++ variables.
   - The `SC_METHOD` `calculate` is sensitive to changes in `principal`, `rate`, and `time`. It performs the same calculations as the original code.
   - In `sc_main`, an instance of `CompoundInterestCalculator` is created, example inputs are provided, and the simulation is run.
   - The result is read from the `ci` output port and printed to the console.
