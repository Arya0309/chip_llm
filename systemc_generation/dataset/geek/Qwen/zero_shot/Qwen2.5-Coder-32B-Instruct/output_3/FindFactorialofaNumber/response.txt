### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Inputs**: 
  - The code does not take any explicit user input within the `main` function. However, if we consider the value of `num` which is hardcoded as `5`, this can be considered an implicit input.
- **Outputs**: 
  - The output is the factorial of the number `5`, which is printed to the console.

### Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation:

1. **Include Directive**:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   ```
   - This line includes the standard input-output stream library, which is necessary for using `cout`.

2. **Namespace Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This line allows us to use standard library names without prefixing them with `std::`.

3. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
   {
       int res = 1, i;
       for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)
           res *= i;
       return res;
   }
   ```
   - **Function Signature**: The function `factorial` takes an unsigned integer `n` as an argument and returns an unsigned integer.
   - **Variable Initialization**: `res` is initialized to `1`. This variable will hold the result of the factorial calculation.
   - **Loop**: A `for` loop starts from `2` and goes up to `n`. For each iteration, `res` is multiplied by the current value of `i`.
   - **Return Statement**: The final result stored in `res` is returned.

4. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int num = 5;
       cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is "
            << factorial(num) << endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - **Variable Declaration**: `num` is declared and initialized to `5`. This is the number whose factorial will be computed.
   - **Output**: The result of `factorial(num)` is printed to the console.
   - **Return Statement**: The `main` function returns `0`, indicating successful execution.

### SystemC Code Snippet

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that uses the provided signals `in` and `out` for input and output, respectively. The code calculates the factorial of the input number and outputs the result.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(FactorialCalculator) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;
    sc_out<unsigned int> out;

    SC_CTOR(FactorialCalculator) {
        SC_METHOD(calculate_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    void calculate_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read();
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    FactorialCalculator calc("calc");
    sc_signal<unsigned int> input;
    sc_signal<unsigned int> output;

    calc.in(input);
    calc.out(output);

    // Test the module with an input value
    input.write(5); // Set the input to 5
    sc_start(); // Start the simulation

    // Output the result
    std::cout << "Factorial of " << input.read() << " is " << output.read() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:

- **Module Definition**:
  - `SC_MODULE(FactorialCalculator)` defines a new SystemC module named `FactorialCalculator`.
  
- **Port Declarations**:
  - `sc_in<unsigned int> in;` declares an input port named `in` of type `unsigned int`.
  - `sc_out<unsigned int> out;` declares an output port named `out` of type `unsigned int`.

- **Constructor**:
  - `SC_CTOR(FactorialCalculator)` is the constructor for the module. It registers the `calculate_factorial` method to be sensitive to changes on the `in` port.

- **Method Definition**:
  - `void calculate_factorial()` is a method that reads the input value, computes its factorial, and writes the result to the output port.
  - **Reading Input**: `unsigned int n = in.read();` reads the current value from the input port.
  - **Factorial Calculation**: Similar to the C++ code, a loop calculates the factorial of `n`.
  - **Writing Output**: `out.write(res);` writes the computed factorial to the output port.

- **Simulation Setup**:
  - An instance of `FactorialCalculator` is created.
  - Two `sc_signal` objects, `input` and `output`, are instantiated to connect to the module's ports.
  - The `input` signal is set to `5` to simulate the input.
  - `sc_start()` runs the simulation.
  - The result is printed to the console using `std::cout`.

This SystemC code mirrors the logic of the original C++ code while being suitable for use in a high-level synthesis flow.
