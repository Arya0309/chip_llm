### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input**: The integer `n` which is hardcoded as `11` in this case.
- **Output**: The program prints either "Even" or "Odd" based on whether the number is divisible by 2.

### Line-by-Line Explanation:
1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This line includes a header file that contains definitions for all standard C++ library functions and classes. However, it's generally not recommended for production code due to its size and potential to increase compilation time.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line allows the use of standard library objects and functions without prefixing them with `std::`.
3. `int main() {`: This line marks the start of the main function, which is the entry point of any C++ program.
4. `int n = 11;`: An integer variable `n` is declared and initialized with the value `11`.
5. `if (n % 2 == 0)`: This line checks if `n` is divisible by 2 by using the modulo operator `%`. If the remainder is `0`, the condition is true.
6. `cout << "Even";`: If the condition in the previous line is true, this line outputs the string "Even".
7. `else`: This keyword indicates the alternative path to take if the condition in the `if` statement is false.
8. `cout << "Odd";`: If the condition in the `if` statement is false, this line outputs the string "Odd".
9. `return 0;`: This line returns `0` from the main function, indicating that the program executed successfully.
10. `}`: This closing brace marks the end of the main function.

### Equivalent SystemC Code:
Below is the SystemC equivalent of the given C++/C code, utilizing the provided `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals for integration with an existing testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(EvenOddChecker) {
    sc_in<int> number_in;   // Input signal for the number to check
    sc_out<int> result_out;  // Output signal indicating if the number is even (0) or odd (1)

    void check_even_odd() {
        int n = number_in.read();  // Read the input number

        // Check if the number is even or odd
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            result_out.write(0);  // Write 0 to indicate the number is even
        } else {
            result_out.write(1);  // Write 1 to indicate the number is odd
        }
    }

    SC_CTOR(EvenOddChecker) {
        SC_METHOD(check_even_odd);
        sensitive << number_in;  // Trigger the method whenever there's a change in number_in
    }
};

// Example testbench to demonstrate the usage of EvenOddChecker module
#include <iostream>

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    sc_signal<int> number_in;
    sc_signal<int> result_out;

    EvenOddChecker checker("checker");
    checker.number_in(number_in);
    checker.result_out(result_out);

    // Test the module with different inputs
    number_in.write(11);
    sc_start();
    std::cout << "Number: 11, Result: " << (result_out.read() == 0 ? "Even" : "Odd") << std::endl;

    number_in.write(12);
    sc_start();
    std::cout << "Number: 12, Result: " << (result_out.read() == 0 ? "Even" : "Odd") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **SC_MODULE Declaration**: Declares a new SystemC module named `EvenOddChecker`.
- **Signals**: The module has two signals, `number_in` and `result_out`, which are used for communication between the module and the testbench.
- **Method `check_even_odd`**: This method reads the input number, checks if it is even or odd, and writes the result to `result_out`.
- **Constructor `SC_CTOR`**: The constructor sets up the sensitivity of the `check_even_odd` method to changes in the `number_in` signal.
- **Testbench**: Demonstrates how to instantiate the `EvenOddChecker` module and test it with different input values. It prints out whether the number is even or odd based on the result written to `result_out`.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source while being compatible with the specified testbench signals.
