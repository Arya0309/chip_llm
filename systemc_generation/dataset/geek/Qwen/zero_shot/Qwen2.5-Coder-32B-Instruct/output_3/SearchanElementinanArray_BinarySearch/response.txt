### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Inputs:**
  - `vector<int>& v`: A sorted vector of integers.
  - `int target`: The integer value to be searched within the vector.
- **Outputs:**
  - `bool`: Returns `true` if the target is found in the vector, otherwise returns `false`.

### Detailed Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation:

1. **Function Definition:**
   ```cpp
   bool binarySearch(vector<int>& v, int target) {
   ```
   - Defines a function named `binarySearch` that takes a reference to a vector of integers `v` and an integer `target`. It returns a boolean indicating whether the target is found in the vector.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```cpp
       int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
   ```
   - Initializes two integer variables `low` and `high` to represent the current search range within the vector. `low` starts at the beginning of the vector, and `high` starts at the end.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   ```cpp
       while (low <= high) {
   ```
   - Begins a loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`, meaning there are elements left to search.

4. **Midpoint Calculation:**
   ```cpp
           int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
   ```
   - Calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current search range. This is done to avoid overflow by first subtracting `low` from `high`.

5. **Check Midpoint:**
   ```cpp
           if (v[mid] == target) {
               return true;
           }
   ```
   - Checks if the element at the midpoint `mid` is equal to the target. If true, the function immediately returns `true`.

6. **Adjust Search Range (Left Half):**
   ```cpp
           if (v[mid] > target)
               high = mid - 1;
   ```
   - If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, the search range is adjusted to the left half by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.

7. **Adjust Search Range (Right Half):**
   ```cpp
           else
               low = mid + 1;
   ```
   - If the element at `mid` is less than the target, the search range is adjusted to the right half by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.

8. **Return False:**
   ```cpp
       return false;
   ```
   - If the loop exits without finding the target, the function returns `false`.

9. **Main Function:**
   ```cpp
   int main() {
       vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};
       int target = 8;
       if (binarySearch(v, target)) {
           cout << target << " found.";
       } else {
           cout << target << " NOT found.";
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - Initializes a sorted vector `v` and sets `target` to 8. Calls `binarySearch` with these values and prints whether the target was found.

### Equivalent SystemC Code Snippet

Below is the equivalent SystemC code using the provided signals for testbench integration:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinarySearchModule) {
    sc_in<int> target;          // Input: Target value to search
    sc_out<bool> found;         // Output: Boolean indicating if target is found
    sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v;     // Input: Sorted vector of integers

    SC_CTOR(BinarySearchModule) : v("v", 8) { // Assuming a fixed size of 8 for simplicity
        SC_METHOD(binary_search);
        sensitive << target;
        dont_initialize();
    }

    void binary_search() {
        int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
        bool result = false;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
            if (v[mid].read() == target.read()) {
                result = true;
                break;
            }
            if (v[mid].read() > target.read())
                high = mid - 1;
            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }
        found.write(result);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    BinarySearchModule bsm("BinarySearchModule");
    sc_signal<int> target_signal;
    sc_signal<bool> found_signal;
    sc_signal<int> v_signal[8];

    // Connecting signals
    bsm.target(target_signal);
    bsm.found(found_signal);
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
        bsm.v[i](v_signal[i]);
    }

    // Initialize vector
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
        v_signal[i].write(i + 1); // Setting values 1 to 8
    }

    // Set target
    target_signal.write(8);

    // Start simulation
    sc_start();

    // Print result
    if (found_signal.read()) {
        std::cout << target_signal.read() << " found." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << target_signal.read() << " NOT found." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **Module Definition:** `BinarySearchModule` is defined as a SystemC module that includes input (`target`) and output (`found`) ports, and a vector of input ports (`v`).
- **Constructor:** The constructor initializes the vector `v` with a fixed size of 8 and sensitizes the `binary_search` method to changes in the `target` signal.
- **Method `binary_search`:** Implements the binary search algorithm similar to the C++ version but uses SystemC's signal read/write methods to handle inputs and outputs.
- **Simulation Setup:** In `sc_main`, the module is instantiated, and signals are connected. The vector `v` is initialized with values 1 through 8, and the target is set to 8. The simulation is started, and the result is printed based on the `found` signal.
