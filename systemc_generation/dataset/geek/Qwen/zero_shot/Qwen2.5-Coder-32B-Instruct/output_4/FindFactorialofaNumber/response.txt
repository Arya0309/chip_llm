### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Inputs**: 
  - The code does not take any explicit input from the user or external sources. However, if we consider the variable `num` within the context of the problem, it acts as an implicit input to the `factorial` function.
- **Outputs**: 
  - The program outputs the factorial of the number `num`, which is `5!` in this case.

### Line-by-Line Explanation:
1. `#include <iostream>`: This includes the input-output stream library which is necessary for using `cout` to print the result to the console.
2. `using namespace std;`: This allows us to use standard library names directly without the `std::` prefix.
3. `unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)`: This declares a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` and returns an unsigned integer. This function calculates the factorial of `n`.
4. `int res = 1, i;`: Initializes two variables, `res` to store the result (initialized to 1 since factorial of 0 is 1) and `i` for iteration.
5. `for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)`: A loop that iterates from 2 to `n`. It multiplies `res` by `i` in each iteration to compute the factorial.
6. `res *= i;`: Multiplies the current value of `res` by `i` and stores the result back in `res`.
7. `return res;`: Returns the computed factorial value.
8. `int main()`: The main function where the execution of the program begins.
9. `int num = 5;`: Declares and initializes `num` to 5, which is the number whose factorial is to be calculated.
10. `cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;`: Prints the factorial of `num` to the console.
11. `return 0;`: Indicates successful termination of the program.

### Equivalent SystemC Code:
The following SystemC code snippet captures the logic of the original C++ code. It uses the provided `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals for input and output respectively.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(FactorialCalculator) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in; // Input port
    sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port

    void calculate_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read(); // Read the input value
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i; // Calculate factorial
        }
        out.write(res); // Write the result to the output port
    }

    SC_CTOR(FactorialCalculator) {
        SC_METHOD(calculate_factorial);
        sensitive << in; // Trigger calculation when input changes
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    FactorialCalculator factorial_calculator("factorial_calculator");
    sc_signal<unsigned int> num; // Signal for input
    sc_signal<unsigned int> result; // Signal for output

    // Connect the signals to the module's ports
    factorial_calculator.in(num);
    factorial_calculator.out(result);

    // Initialize the input
    num.write(5);

    // Start simulation
    sc_start();

    // Print the result
    cout << "Factorial of " << num.read() << " is " << result.read() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **Module Declaration**: `SC_MODULE(FactorialCalculator)` defines a new SystemC module named `FactorialCalculator`.
- **Ports**: The module has two ports, `in` and `out`, for input and output respectively.
- **Method**: `calculate_factorial()` is a method that computes the factorial of the input number and writes the result to the output port.
- **Sensitivity**: The method is sensitive to changes in the `in` signal, meaning it triggers whenever the input value changes.
- **Main Function**: In `sc_main`, an instance of `FactorialCalculator` is created, and signals are connected to its ports. The input is initialized to `5`, and the simulation is started. The result is then printed to the console.

This SystemC code snippet can be integrated into a larger testbench and used in a high-level synthesis flow, adhering to the provided input/output specifications.
