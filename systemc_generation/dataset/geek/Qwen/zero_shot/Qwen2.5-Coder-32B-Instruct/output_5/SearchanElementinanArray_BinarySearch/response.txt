### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `vector<int>& v`: A sorted vector of integers where the binary search will be performed.
  - `int target`: The integer value to be searched within the vector.
- **Outputs**:
  - `bool`: Returns `true` if the target is found in the vector, otherwise returns `false`.

#### Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   bool binarySearch(vector<int>& v, int target) {
   ```
   - This function `binarySearch` takes a reference to a vector of integers `v` and an integer `target` as inputs and returns a boolean indicating whether the target is present in the vector.

2. **Initialization of Search Range**:
   ```cpp
   int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
   ```
   - `low` and `high` are initialized to represent the current range of indices being searched within the vector `v`. Initially, this is the entire vector.

3. **While Loop for Binary Search**:
   ```cpp
   while (low <= high) {
   ```
   - The loop continues as long as there is at least one element between `low` and `high` inclusive, meaning there is still a chance to find the target within the current range.

4. **Calculate Midpoint**:
   ```cpp
   int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
   ```
   - The midpoint `mid` of the current search range is calculated. This is done to avoid overflow by computing `(high - low) / 2` first before adding `low`.

5. **Check Middle Element**:
   ```cpp
   if (v[mid] == target) {
       return true;
   }
   ```
   - If the element at index `mid` is equal to the `target`, the function immediately returns `true`, indicating that the target has been found.

6. **Adjust Search Range Based on Comparison**:
   ```cpp
   if (v[mid] > target)
       high = mid - 1;
   else
       low = mid + 1;
   ```
   - If the element at `mid` is greater than the `target`, the search range is adjusted to the lower half by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - Otherwise, the search range is adjusted to the upper half by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.

7. **Return False if Target Not Found**:
   ```cpp
   return false;
   ```
   - If the loop exits without finding the target, the function returns `false`, indicating that the target is not present in the vector.

8. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
   int main() {
       vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};
       int target = 8;
       if (binarySearch(v, target)) {
           cout << target << " found.";
       } else {
           cout << target << " NOT found.";
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function initializes a vector `v` and a target integer `target`. It then calls `binarySearch` to check if the target is in the vector and prints the result.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the SystemC code snippet that implements the same binary search logic using the provided signals `target`, `found`, and `v`.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinarySearchModule) {
    sc_in<int> target;                // Input: The target integer to search for
    sc_out<bool> found;               // Output: Boolean indicating if target is found
    sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v;          // Input: Sorted vector of integers

    SC_CTOR(BinarySearchModule) : v("v", 8) { // Constructor initializing the vector size to 8
        SC_METHOD(search);             // Register the search method as a SystemC process
        sensitive << target;           // Sensitivity to target signal change
    }

    void search() {
        int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;

            if (v[mid].read() == target.read()) {
                found.write(true);
                return;
            }

            if (v[mid].read() > target.read())
                high = mid - 1;
            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }

        found.write(false);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    BinarySearchModule bsm("bsm");

    sc_signal<int> target_signal;
    sc_signal<bool> found_signal;
    sc_vector<sc_signal<int>> v_signals("v_signals", 8);

    bsm.target(target_signal);
    bsm.found(found_signal);
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
        bsm.v[i](v_signals[i]);
    }

    // Initialize vector values
    v_signals[0].write(1);
    v_signals[1].write(2);
    v_signals[2].write(3);
    v_signals[3].write(4);
    v_signals[4].write(5);
    v_signals[5].write(8);
    v_signals[6].write(9);
    v_signals[7].write(11);

    // Set target
    target_signal.write(8);

    sc_start(); // Start simulation

    // Output result
    if (found_signal.read()) {
        cout << target_signal.read() << " found." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << target_signal.read() << " NOT found." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Module Declaration**:
  - `BinarySearchModule` is declared as a SystemC module with input (`target`), output (`found`), and a vector of inputs (`v`).

- **Constructor**:
  - Initializes the vector size to 8.
  - Registers the `search` method as a SystemC process sensitive to changes in the `target` signal.

- **Search Method**:
  - Implements the binary search logic similar to the C++ function.
  - Uses `v[mid].read()` and `target.read()` to read the values from the signals.
  - Writes the result to the `found` signal.

- **Main Function**:
  - Instantiates the `BinarySearchModule` and connects its ports to corresponding signals.
  - Initializes the vector `v` with values and sets the `target`.
  - Starts the simulation and prints the result based on the `found` signal.
