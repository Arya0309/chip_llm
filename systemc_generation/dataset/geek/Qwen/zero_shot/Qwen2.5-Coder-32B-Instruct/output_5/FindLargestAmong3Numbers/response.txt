### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Inputs**: The program uses three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c` which are hardcoded in this example but could be considered as inputs.
- **Outputs**: The program prints the largest of the three numbers to the console.

### Detailed Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation:
1. **Include Directive**: 
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   ```
   - This line includes the standard input-output stream library, which is necessary for using `cout`.

2. **Namespace Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This line allows us to use the standard namespace, which means we don't need to prefix standard library objects with `std::`.

3. **Main Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   int main() {
   ```
   - This is the entry point of the C++ program. The execution starts from here.

4. **Variable Declarations and Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int a = 1, b = 2, c = 11;
   ```
   - Three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared and initialized with values 1, 2, and 11 respectively.

5. **First If Condition**:
   ```cpp
   if (a >= b) {
   ```
   - This condition checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If true, the nested block of code is executed.

6. **Nested If Condition**:
   ```cpp
   if (a >= c)
       cout << a;
   ```
   - If the first condition (`a >= b`) is true, this condition checks if `a` is also greater than or equal to `c`. If true, it prints `a`.

7. **Else Block for Nested If**:
   ```cpp
   else
       cout << c;
   ```
   - If the nested if condition (`a >= c`) is false, this block is executed, printing `c`.

8. **Else Block for First If Condition**:
   ```cpp
   } else {
   ```
   - If the first condition (`a >= b`) is false, this block is executed.

9. **Second Nested If Condition**:
   ```cpp
   if (b >= c)
       cout << b;
   ```
   - Inside the else block, this condition checks if `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If true, it prints `b`.

10. **Else Block for Second Nested If**:
    ```cpp
    else
        cout << c;
    ```
    - If the second nested if condition (`b >= c`) is false, this block is executed, printing `c`.

11. **Return Statement**:
    ```cpp
    return 0;
    ```
    - The main function returns 0, indicating successful completion of the program.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that performs the same logic and integrates with the provided testbench signals.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LargestNumberFinder) {
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;
    sc_in<int> c;
    sc_out<int> largest;

    SC_CTOR(LargestNumberFinder) {
        SC_METHOD(findLargest);
        sensitive << a << b << c; // Sensitivity list
    }

    void findLargest() {
        int result;
        if (a.read() >= b.read()) {
            if (a.read() >= c.read())
                result = a.read();
            else
                result = c.read();
        } else {
            if (b.read() >= c.read())
                result = b.read();
            else
                result = c.read();
        }
        largest.write(result);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    LargestNumberFinder lnf("lnf");
    sc_signal<int> a, b, c, largest;

    lnf.a(a);
    lnf.b(b);
    lnf.c(c);
    lnf.largest(largest);

    a = 1;
    b = 2;
    c = 11;

    sc_start();

    cout << "The largest number is: " << largest.read() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **Module Declaration**: `SC_MODULE(LargestNumberFinder)` declares a SystemC module named `LargestNumberFinder`.
- **Ports Declaration**: Ports `a`, `b`, `c` are declared as `sc_in<int>` for input and `largest` as `sc_out<int>` for output.
- **Constructor**: `SC_CTOR(LargestNumberFinder)` initializes the module and registers the `findLargest` method to be sensitive to changes in `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- **Method Definition**: `void findLargest()` contains the logic to determine the largest number among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and writes the result to `largest`.
- **Testbench Setup**: In `sc_main`, an instance of `LargestNumberFinder` is created, and signals are connected to its ports. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are set, and the simulation is started.
- **Output**: After simulation, the largest number is printed to the console.

This SystemC code mirrors the logic of the original C++ code while being compatible with the specified testbench signals.
