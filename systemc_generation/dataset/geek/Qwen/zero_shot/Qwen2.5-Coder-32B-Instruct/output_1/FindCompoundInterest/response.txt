### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: 
  - `principal`: The initial amount of money (double).
  - `rate`: The annual interest rate (in percentage) (double).
  - `time`: The time period for which the interest is calculated (in years) (double).

- **Outputs**:
  - `CI`: The compound interest calculated over the specified time period (double).

### Line-by-Line Explanation

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This line includes a header file that contains definitions for standard input/output streams, algorithms, and data structures, among other things. It's a convenient way to include most of the standard library headers.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line allows us to use standard library names without prefixing them with `std::`.
3. `int main()`: This is the main function where the execution of the program begins.
4. `double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;`: These lines declare three double variables (`principal`, `rate`, and `time`) and initialize them with specific values. In the context of the task, these values should be replaced with inputs from the user or external sources.
5. `double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));`: This line calculates the future value of the investment/loan, including interest. Here, `A` is the amount after `time` years, `principal` is the initial amount, `rate` is the annual interest rate, and `time` is the duration in years. The `pow` function is used to raise `(1 + rate / 100)` to the power of `time`.
6. `double CI = A - principal;`: This line computes the compound interest by subtracting the initial principal from the total amount `A`.
7. `cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;`: This line prints the calculated compound interest to the console.
8. `return 0;`: This line ends the `main` function and returns 0, indicating that the program has executed successfully.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the SystemC code that mirrors the logic of the original C++ code. This code uses the provided signals for seamless integration with the testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
    sc_in<double> principal;  // Input port for principal
    sc_in<double> rate;       // Input port for rate
    sc_in<double> time;       // Input port for time
    sc_out<double> ci;        // Output port for compound interest

    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
        SC_METHOD(calculate);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;  // Sensitive to changes in any input
    }

    void calculate() {
        double A = principal.read() * (pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read()));
        double CI = A - principal.read();
        ci.write(CI);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    CompoundInterestCalculator cic("CompoundInterestCalculator");
    
    // Example signals for testing (not connected to any simulation environment)
    sc_signal<double> principal_sig;
    sc_signal<double> rate_sig;
    sc_signal<double> time_sig;
    sc_signal<double> ci_sig;

    // Connecting the signals to the module
    cic.principal(principal_sig);
    cic.rate(rate_sig);
    cic.time(time_sig);
    cic.ci(ci_sig);

    // Setting example values
    principal_sig = 10000.0;
    rate_sig = 5.0;
    time_sig = 2.0;

    // Run the simulation
    sc_start();

    // Output the result
    std::cout << "Compound interest is " << ci_sig.read() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **SC_MODULE**: Defines a new SystemC module named `CompoundInterestCalculator`.
- **sc_in<double> principal, rate, time;**: Declare input ports for the principal, rate, and time.
- **sc_out<double> ci;**: Declare an output port for the compound interest.
- **SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator)**: Constructor for the module. It registers a method `calculate` that is sensitive to changes in the `principal`, `rate`, and `time` signals.
- **void calculate()**: This method calculates the compound interest using the same formula as the original C++ code and writes the result to the `ci` output port.
- **sc_main**: The main function for the SystemC simulation. It creates an instance of the `CompoundInterestCalculator` module, connects it to example signals, sets some example values, runs the simulation, and prints the result.

This SystemC code can be integrated into a larger simulation framework or used in a high-level synthesis flow, leveraging the provided input and output signals.
