### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Two complex numbers, each represented by their real and imaginary parts. These are `real1`, `imag1` for the first complex number, and `real2`, `imag2` for the second complex number.
- **Outputs**: The sum of the two complex numbers, represented by its real and imaginary parts. These are `real_sum` and `imag_sum`.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Class Definition**:
   - A class `Complex` is defined with two public integer members: `real` and `imaginary`.
   
2. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor initializes the `real` and `imaginary` parts of a complex number. If no arguments are provided, they default to 0.

3. **Method `addComp`**:
   - This method takes two `Complex` objects as parameters and returns a new `Complex` object representing their sum.
   - It adds the `real` parts of the two complex numbers and assigns the result to the `real` part of a temporary `Complex` object.
   - Similarly, it adds the `imaginary` parts of the two complex numbers and assigns the result to the `imaginary` part of the temporary `Complex` object.
   - The temporary `Complex` object, which holds the sum, is returned.

4. **Driver Code**:
   - Two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` are instantiated with specific values.
   - The `addComp` method is called with `C1` and `C2` as arguments, and the result is stored in `C3`.
   - The real and imaginary parts of `C1`, `C2`, and `C3` are printed to the console.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the SystemC equivalent of the provided C++/C code. It uses the provided signals (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, `real_sum`, `imag_sum`) for seamless integration with an existing testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    // Input ports
    sc_in<int> real1;
    sc_in<int> imag1;
    sc_in<int> real2;
    sc_in<int> imag2;

    // Output ports
    sc_out<int> real_sum;
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Register the process with the SystemC kernel
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2; // Sensitive to changes in input signals
    }

    void add() {
        // Read inputs
        int r1 = real1.read();
        int i1 = imag1.read();
        int r2 = real2.read();
        int i2 = imag2.read();

        // Perform addition
        int real_result = r1 + r2;
        int imag_result = i1 + i2;

        // Write outputs
        real_sum.write(real_result);
        imag_sum.write(imag_result);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // Create instances of signals
    sc_signal<int> real1, imag1, real2, imag2, real_sum, imag_sum;

    // Create an instance of the ComplexAdder module
    ComplexAdder complex_adder("complex_adder");

    // Connect the signals to the module's ports
    complex_adder.real1(real1);
    complex_adder.imag1(imag1);
    complex_adder.real2(real2);
    complex_adder.imag2(imag2);
    complex_adder.real_sum(real_sum);
    complex_adder.imag_sum(imag_sum);

    // Initialize inputs
    real1.write(3);
    imag1.write(2);
    real2.write(9);
    imag2.write(5);

    // Start simulation
    sc_start();

    // Print results
    cout << "Sum of complex number : " << real_sum.read() << " + i" << imag_sum.read() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **Module Definition**:
   - A SystemC module `ComplexAdder` is defined with input and output ports corresponding to the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers and their sum.

2. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor registers a method `add` that is sensitive to changes in any of the input signals.

3. **Method `add`**:
   - Reads the current values from the input signals.
   - Computes the sum of the real and imaginary parts separately.
   - Writes the computed results to the output signals.

4. **Main Function**:
   - Instantiates the necessary signals and the `ComplexAdder` module.
   - Connects the signals to the module's ports.
   - Initializes the input signals with specific values.
   - Starts the simulation.
   - Prints the results after the simulation completes.

This SystemC code accurately reflects the logic of the original C++/C code while adhering to the constraints and requirements specified.
