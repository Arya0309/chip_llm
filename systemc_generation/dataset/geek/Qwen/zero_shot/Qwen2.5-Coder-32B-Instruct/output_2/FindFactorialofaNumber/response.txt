### Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs:**
- The input to this C++/C program is a single integer `num`, which is set to 5 in the `main` function. However, for a more generalized approach, we will consider `num` as an input parameter that can vary.

**Outputs:**
- The output is the factorial of the input number, which is printed to the console.

### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation

1. `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the standard input-output stream library, allowing the use of `cout` for printing to the console.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line allows the use of standard library names without prefixing them with `std::`.
3. `unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)`: This line declares a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as an argument and returns an unsigned integer.
4. `int res = 1, i;`: Inside the `factorial` function, an integer variable `res` is initialized to 1, and another integer variable `i` is declared.
5. `for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)`: This line starts a for loop that iterates from 2 to `n` inclusive. The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
6. `res *= i;`: In each iteration of the loop, `res` is multiplied by the current value of `i`. This effectively calculates the factorial of `n`.
7. `return res;`: After the loop completes, the function returns the computed factorial value stored in `res`.
8. `int main()`: This line defines the main function where the execution of the program begins.
9. `int num = 5;`: An integer variable `num` is initialized to 5. This is the number whose factorial will be calculated.
10. `cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;`: This line prints the string "Factorial of ", followed by the value of `num`, the string " is ", and then the result of calling the `factorial` function with `num` as the argument.
11. `return 0;`: The main function returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program.

### SystemC Code Equivalent

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that replicates the functionality of the provided C++/C code. It uses the provided `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals for input and output integration with a testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(FactorialCalculator) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port
    sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port

    SC_CTOR(FactorialCalculator) {
        SC_METHOD(calculate_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    void calculate_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read();
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    FactorialCalculator factorial_calc("factorial_calc");
    sc_signal<unsigned int> num;
    sc_signal<unsigned int> result;

    factorial_calc.in(num);
    factorial_calc.out(result);

    // Example input value
    num.write(5);

    sc_start();

    // Print the result after simulation
    std::cout << "Factorial of " << num.read() << " is " << result.read() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **SC_MODULE Declaration**: `SC_MODULE(FactorialCalculator)` defines a SystemC module named `FactorialCalculator`.
2. **Port Declarations**: `sc_in<unsigned int> in;` and `sc_out<unsigned int> out;` declare input and output ports for the module.
3. **Constructor**: `SC_CTOR(FactorialCalculator)` initializes the module. It registers the `calculate_factorial` method to be sensitive to changes on the `in` port.
4. **Method Definition**: `void calculate_factorial()` is a method that reads the input value, computes the factorial, and writes the result to the output port.
5. **Main Function**: `int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[])` sets up the simulation environment. It instantiates the `FactorialCalculator` module and connects the `num` signal to the input port and `result` signal to the output port.
6. **Simulation Execution**: `sc_start();` starts the simulation, and the result is printed to the console after the simulation completes.

This SystemC code can be integrated into an existing testbench using the provided `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals.
