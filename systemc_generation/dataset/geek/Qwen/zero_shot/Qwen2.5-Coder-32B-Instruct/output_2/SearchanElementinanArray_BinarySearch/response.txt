### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs**:
  - A sorted vector `v` containing integers.
  - An integer `target` which is the number to be searched within the vector `v`.
  
- **Outputs**:
  - A boolean value indicating whether the `target` is found in the vector `v`.

### Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation

1. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   bool binarySearch(vector<int>& v, int target) {
   ```
   - This function takes a reference to a vector of integers `v` and an integer `target`. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the `target` is present in the vector `v`.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
   ```
   - Two integer variables `low` and `high` are initialized to represent the current range of indices being considered in the vector. Initially, `low` starts at the beginning of the vector (index 0), and `high` starts at the end of the vector (index `v.size() - 1`).

3. **Loop Condition**:
   ```cpp
   while (low <= high) {
   ```
   - This loop continues as long as there is a valid range to search (i.e., `low` is less than or equal to `high`). The loop effectively narrows down the search range until the `target` is found or the range becomes invalid.

4. **Midpoint Calculation**:
   ```cpp
   int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
   ```
   - The midpoint index `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`, ensuring that the division does not cause overflow.

5. **Check Midpoint Value**:
   ```cpp
   if (v[mid] == target) {
       return true;
   }
   ```
   - If the element at the midpoint `v[mid]` is equal to the `target`, the function immediately returns `true`, indicating that the `target` has been found.

6. **Adjust Search Range (Left Half)**:
   ```cpp
   if (v[mid] > target)
       high = mid - 1;
   ```
   - If the element at the midpoint `v[mid]` is greater than the `target`, it means the `target` must be in the left half of the current range. Therefore, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` to narrow the search range to the left half.

7. **Adjust Search Range (Right Half)**:
   ```cpp
   else
       low = mid + 1;
   ```
   - If the element at the midpoint `v[mid]` is less than the `target`, it means the `target` must be in the right half of the current range. Therefore, `low` is updated to `mid + 1` to narrow the search range to the right half.

8. **Return Not Found**:
   ```cpp
   return false;
   ```
   - If the loop exits without finding the `target`, the function returns `false`, indicating that the `target` is not present in the vector.

9. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
   int main() {
       vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};
       int target = 8;
       if (binarySearch(v, target)) {
           cout << target << " found.";
       } else {
           cout << target << " NOT found.";
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function initializes a vector `v` and a `target` value. It calls the `binarySearch` function with these values and prints whether the `target` was found or not.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinarySearch) {
    sc_in<int> target;
    sc_out<bool> found;
    sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v;

    SC_CTOR(BinarySearch) : v("v", 8) {
        SC_METHOD(search);
        sensitive << target;
        dont_initialize();
    }

    void search() {
        int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
        bool result = false;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
            if (v[mid].read() == target.read()) {
                result = true;
                break;
            }
            if (v[mid].read() > target.read())
                high = mid - 1;
            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }

        found.write(result);
    }
};

// Example usage in a testbench
int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    sc_signal<int> target;
    sc_signal<bool> found;
    sc_vector<sc_signal<int>> v("v", 8);

    // Initialize the vector with some values
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
        v[i].write(i + 1); // Values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
    }

    BinarySearch bs("bs");
    bs.target(target);
    bs.found(found);
    bs.v(v);

    // Test the module
    target.write(8);
    sc_start();

    if (found.read()) {
        cout << target.read() << " found." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << target.read() << " NOT found." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **Module Declaration**:
  - The `BinarySearch` module is declared with three ports: `target` (input), `found` (output), and `v` (vector input).

- **Constructor**:
  - The constructor initializes the `sc_vector` `v` with 8 elements and registers the `search` method to be triggered whenever the `target` changes.

- **Search Method**:
  - The `search` method implements the binary search algorithm using the provided ports. It reads the `target` and elements of `v` to determine if the `target` is present, writing the result to `found`.

- **Testbench**:
  - An example testbench initializes the vector `v` with values from 1 to 8 and sets the `target` to 8. It then starts the simulation and checks the `found` signal to print whether the `target` was found.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C binary search implementation and can be integrated into a larger SystemC design or synthesized using high-level synthesis tools.
