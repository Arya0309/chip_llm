### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Inputs**: Two integers `a` and `b`.
- **Outputs**: An integer representing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.

### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation:
1. **`#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: This line includes a header file that includes most of the standard C++ libraries. It is not recommended for production code due to inefficiency and potential conflicts, but it simplifies including multiple libraries.
2. **`using namespace std;`**: This line allows the use of standard library functions and objects without prefixing them with `std::`.
3. **`int gcd(int a, int b)`**: This line declares a function named `gcd` which takes two integers as arguments and returns an integer.
4. **`int res = min(a, b);`**: Inside the `gcd` function, this line initializes `res` with the smaller of the two input integers `a` and `b`.
5. **`while (res > 1)`**: This loop continues as long as `res` is greater than 1. It iteratively checks for the greatest common divisor.
6. **`if (a % res == 0 && b % res == 0)`**: Inside the loop, this condition checks if both `a` and `b` are divisible by `res`.
7. **`break;`**: If the condition is true, the loop breaks, and `res` is the GCD.
8. **`res--;`**: If the condition is false, `res` is decremented by 1, and the loop continues.
9. **`return res;`**: The function returns the value of `res`, which is the GCD of `a` and `b`.
10. **`int main()`**: This is the main function where the program execution starts.
11. **`int a = 12, b = 16;`**: These lines initialize the integers `a` and `b` with values 12 and 16, respectively.
12. **`cout << gcd(a, b);`**: This line calls the `gcd` function with `a` and `b` as arguments and prints the result.
13. **`return 0;`**: The main function returns 0, indicating successful execution.

### Equivalent SystemC Code:
Below is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that uses the provided signals (`sc_in<int> a`, `sc_in<int> b`, `sc_out<int> gcd_result`) for testbench integration.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(GCDModule) {
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;
    sc_out<int> gcd_result;

    SC_CTOR(GCDModule) {
        SC_METHOD(compute_gcd);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    void compute_gcd() {
        int res = std::min(a.read(), b.read());

        while (res > 1) {
            if (a.read() % res == 0 && b.read() % res == 0) {
                break;
            }
            res--;
        }

        gcd_result.write(res);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    GCDModule gcd_module("gcd_module");
    sc_signal<int> a_sig, b_sig, gcd_result_sig;

    gcd_module.a(a_sig);
    gcd_module.b(b_sig);
    gcd_module.gcd_result(gcd_result_sig);

    // Example test case
    a_sig.write(12);
    b_sig.write(16);

    sc_start();

    std::cout << "GCD of " << a_sig.read() << " and " << b_sig.read() << " is: " << gcd_result_sig.read() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code:
- **Module Declaration**: The `GCDModule` class is declared as a SystemC module with three ports: `a`, `b`, and `gcd_result`.
- **Constructor**: The constructor registers the `compute_gcd` method to be sensitive to changes on ports `a` and `b`.
- **`compute_gcd` Method**: This method computes the GCD of the values read from ports `a` and `b` and writes the result to `gcd_result`.
- **Testbench Setup**: In `sc_main`, an instance of `GCDModule` is created, and signals are connected to its ports. A test case is provided to demonstrate the module's functionality.
- **Execution**: The simulation is started with `sc_start()`, and the GCD result is printed to the console.
