#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `principal`: The initial amount of money.
  - `rate`: The annual interest rate (in percentage).
  - `time`: The time period for which the interest is calculated (in years).
- **Outputs**:
  - `ci`: The calculated compound interest.

#### Detailed Explanation Line-by-Line

1. **Include Statements and Namespace**
   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - Includes standard library headers and uses the standard namespace for simplicity.

2. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;
   ```
   - Initializes the variables `principal`, `rate`, and `time` with the given values.

3. **Calculate Compound Interest**
   ```cpp
       double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));
   ```
   - Calculates the future value `A` using the formula \( A = P \times (1 + r/n)^{nt} \). Here, `n` is 1 since the interest is compounded annually.
   - `A` represents the total amount after interest.

4. **Calculate Compound Interest Amount**
   ```cpp
       double CI = A - principal;
   ```
   - Calculates the compound interest by subtracting the principal from the total amount `A`.

5. **Output the Result**
   ```cpp
       cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;
   ```
   - Prints the calculated compound interest to the console.

6. **Return Statement**
   ```cpp
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - Returns 0 indicating successful execution.

### Equivalent SystemC Code Snippet

Below is the SystemC code that replicates the functionality of the provided C++/C code. It includes the necessary signals (`principal`, `rate`, `time`, and `ci`) and follows the same logic:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CI_Calculator) {
    sc_in<double> principal;  // Input port for the principal amount
    sc_in<double> rate;     // Input port for the interest rate
    sc_in<double> time;     // Input port for the time period
    sc_out<double> ci;      // Output port for the compound interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CI_Calculator) {
        // Process to calculate compound interest
        SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculate_ci() {
        double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
        double CI = A - principal.read();
        ci.write(CI);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    CI_Calculator ci_calculator("ci_calculator");
    
    // Example usage
    sc_signal<double> p, r, t, c;
    ci_calculator.principal(p);
    ci_calculator.rate(r);
    ci_calculator.time(t);
    ci_calculator.ci(c);

    // Assign values to inputs
    p = 10000;
    r = 5;
    t = 2;

    // Run simulation
    sc_start();

    // Print result
    std::cout << "Compound interest is " << c.read() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Module Declaration**:
  - `CI_Calculator` is declared as a SystemC module with input ports `principal`, `rate`, and `time`, and an output port `ci`.
  
- **Constructor**:
  - The constructor sets up a method `calculate_ci` to be triggered whenever any of the input signals change.

- **Method `calculate_ci`**:
  - Reads the current values of `principal`, `rate`, and `time`.
  - Computes the future value `A` and then calculates the compound interest `CI`.
  - Writes the computed compound interest to the output port `ci`.

- **Main Function (`sc_main`)**:
  - Instantiates the `CI_Calculator` module and connects its ports to signals.
  - Assigns sample values to the input signals.
  - Runs the simulation using `sc_start()` and prints the resulting compound interest.

This SystemC code accurately mirrors the functionality of the original C++/C code, making it suitable for integration into a high-level synthesis flow.
