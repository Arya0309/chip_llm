#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The C++ program does not take any user inputs directly from the console. Instead, it uses hardcoded values for the complex numbers `C1` and `C2`.
- **Outputs**: The program prints the real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Imports and Namespace**
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes the standard library and sets the standard namespace to `std`.

2. **User-defined Complex Class**
   ```cpp
   class Complex { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0) {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2) {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary;
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - A class `Complex` is defined with public members `real` and `imaginary`.
   - A constructor initializes these members with default values if none are provided.
   - The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects as parameters, adds their real and imaginary parts respectively, and returns a new `Complex` object containing the result.

3. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main() {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Two instances of `Complex`, `C1` and `C2`, are created with specific values.
   - The real and imaginary parts of each complex number are printed.
   - Another instance `C3` is created to store the sum of `C1` and `C2`. The `addComp` method is called to compute this sum.
   - The real and imaginary parts of the resulting sum are printed.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

The goal is to create a SystemC module that performs the same operations as the given C++ code. The module should use the provided signals (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, `real_sum`, `imag_sum`) to handle the inputs and outputs.

Here's the SystemC code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Define a module to add two complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    // Input ports for the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real1;
    sc_in<int> imag1;

    // Input ports for the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;
    sc_in<int> imag2;

    // Output ports for the real and imaginary parts of the sum
    sc_out<int> real_sum;
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(complex_add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void complex_add() {
        // Calculate the real part of the sum
        int sum_real = real1.read() + real2.read();
        // Calculate the imaginary part of the sum
        int sum_imag = imag1.read() + imag2.read();
        // Write the results to the output ports
        real_sum.write(sum_real);
        imag_sum.write(sum_imag);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Definition**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
   ```
   - Defines a SystemC module named `ComplexAdder`.

2. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<int> real1;
   sc_in<int> imag1;
   sc_in<int> real2;
   sc_in<int> imag2;
   sc_out<int> real_sum;
   sc_out<int> imag_sum;
   ```
   - Declares input ports for the real and imaginary parts of the first and second complex numbers.
   - Declares output ports for the real and imaginary parts of the sum.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
       SC_METHOD(complex_add);
       sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
   }
   ```
   - Constructs the module and binds the `complex_add` method to be executed whenever any of the input ports change.

4. **Method to Perform Addition**
   ```cpp
   void complex_add() {
       int sum_real = real1.read() + real2.read();
       int sum_imag = imag1.read() + imag2.read();
       real_sum.write(sum_real);
       imag_sum.write(sum_imag);
   }
   ```
   - Reads the real and imaginary parts of both complex numbers from the input ports.
   - Computes the sum of the real and imaginary parts separately.
   - Writes the computed sums to the output ports.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ code and can be integrated into a larger SystemC design or testbench.
