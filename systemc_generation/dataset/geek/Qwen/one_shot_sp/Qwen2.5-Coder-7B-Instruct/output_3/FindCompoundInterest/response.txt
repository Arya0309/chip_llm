#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: 
  - `principal`: Initial amount of money (double)
  - `rate`: Annual interest rate (double)
  - `time`: Time period in years (double)
- **Output**:
  - `ci`: Compound interest calculated over the specified time period (double)

#### Detailed Explanation of the Code

1. **Header Files and Namespace**
   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header includes all standard libraries.
   - `using namespace std;` allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.

2. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;
   ```
   - Declares and initializes three variables: `principal`, `rate`, and `time`.

3. **Calculate Compound Interest**
   ```cpp
       double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));
       double CI = A - principal;
   ```
   - Calculates the future value `A` using the formula \( A = P \times (1 + r/n)^{nt} \). Here, `n=1` since interest is compounded annually.
   - Computes the compound interest `CI` as the difference between the future value and the principal.

4. **Output the Result**
   ```cpp
       cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;
   ```
   - Prints the calculated compound interest.

5. **Return Statement**
   ```cpp
       return 0;
   ```
   - Ends the program successfully.

### Equivalent SystemC Code Snippet

To create a SystemC module that replicates the functionality of the provided C++ code, we need to define the necessary ports and implement the same calculations within a SystemC process.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to calculate compound interest
SC_MODULE(CI_Calculator) {
    sc_in<double> principal;  // Input port for the principal amount
    sc_in<double> rate;     // Input port for the annual interest rate
    sc_in<double> time;     // Input port for the time period in years
    sc_out<double> ci;      // Output port for the calculated compound interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CI_Calculator) {
        // Process to calculate compound interest
        SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculate_ci() {
        double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
        double CI = A - principal.read();
        ci.write(CI);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(CI_Calculator) {
   ```
   - Defines a new SystemC module named `CI_Calculator`.

2. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<double> principal;
   sc_in<double> rate;
   sc_in<double> time;
   sc_out<double> ci;
   ```
   - Declares four ports: `principal`, `rate`, `time` as input ports and `ci` as an output port.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(CI_Calculator) {
       SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
       sensitive << principal << rate << time;
   }
   ```
   - Constructs the module and binds the `calculate_ci` method to be executed whenever any of the input ports change.

4. **Method to Calculate Compound Interest**
   ```cpp
   void calculate_ci() {
       double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
       double CI = A - principal.read();
       ci.write(CI);
   }
   ```
   - Reads the values from the input ports.
   - Calculates the future value `A` and then the compound interest `CI`.
   - Writes the calculated compound interest to the output port `ci`.

This SystemC code accurately mirrors the logic of the original C++ code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
