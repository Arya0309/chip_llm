#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `real1`: Real part of the first complex number.
  - `imag1`: Imaginary part of the first complex number.
  - `real2`: Real part of the second complex number.
  - `imag2`: Imaginary part of the second complex number.
- **Outputs**:
  - `real_sum`: Real part of the sum of the two complex numbers.
  - `imag_sum`: Imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Class Definition**
   ```cpp
   class Complex { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           return temp;
       }
   };
   ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - A `Complex` class is defined to represent a complex number with real and imaginary parts.
     - A constructor initializes the real and imaginary parts.
     - The `addComp()` method takes two `Complex` objects, adds their real and imaginary parts respectively, and returns a new `Complex` object representing the sum.

2. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2); cout << ... ;
       Complex C2(9, 5); cout << ... ;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << ... ;
   }
   ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - Two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` are created with initial values `(3, 2)` and `(9, 5)`, respectively.
     - A third `Complex` object `C3` is created.
     - The `addComp()` method is called to add `C1` and `C2`, and the result is stored in `C3`.
     - The sum is printed to the console.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

To convert the given C++/C code into SystemC, we need to define a module that takes four integer inputs (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`) and produces two integer outputs (`real_sum`, `imag_sum`). Here's how you can do it:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(complex_add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void complex_add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

#### Explanation of the SystemC Code
- **Inputs**:
  - `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`: These are the input ports for the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
- **Outputs**:
  - `real_sum`, `imag_sum`: These are the output ports for the real and imaginary parts of the sum.
- **Constructor**:
  - The constructor initializes the module and specifies that the `complex_add` method should be executed whenever any of the input ports change.
- **Method**:
  - `complex_add`: This method reads the values from the input ports, computes the sum of the real and imaginary parts separately, and writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC code snippet faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated with the provided testbench signals.
