The provided C++/C code calculates the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals of a square matrix. Here are the details:

**Inputs:**
- `mat`: A two-dimensional integer array representing the square matrix.
- `n`: An integer representing the size of the matrix (number of rows/columns).

**Outputs:**
- The function does not return any value directly but prints the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals using `cout`.

### Line-by-Line Analysis

Let's break down the code into blocks and explain each part:

#### Block 1: Include Statements and Namespace Declaration
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
```
- Includes all standard library headers and uses the standard namespace.

#### Block 2: Constant Definition
```cpp
const int MAX = 100;
```
- Defines a constant `MAX` which is set to 100. This limits the size of the matrix to 100x100.

#### Block 3: Function Declaration
```cpp
void printDiagonalSums(int mat[][MAX], int n)
```
- Declares a function `printDiagonalSums` that takes a two-dimensional array `mat` and an integer `n` as parameters.

#### Block 4: Variable Initialization
```cpp
int principal = 0, secondary = 0;
```
- Initializes two integer variables `principal` and `secondary` to store the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively.

#### Block 5: Nested Loop to Calculate Diagonal Sums
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        if (i == j)
            principal += mat[i][j];
        if ((i + j) == (n - 1))
            secondary += mat[i][j];
    }
}
```
- Uses nested loops to iterate over each element of the matrix.
- If the current element is on the principal diagonal (`i == j`), it adds the element to `principal`.
- If the current element is on the secondary diagonal (`(i + j) == (n - 1)`), it adds the element to `secondary`.

#### Block 6: Print Results
```cpp
cout << "Principal Diagonal:" << principal << endl;
cout << "Secondary Diagonal:" << secondary << endl;
```
- Prints the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals.

#### Block 7: Main Function
```cpp
int main() {
    int a[][MAX] = {{1, 2, 3, 4},
                    {5, 6, 7, 8},
                    {1, 2, 3, 4},
                    {5, 6, 7, 8}};
    printDiagonalSums(a, 4);
    return 0;
}
```
- Defines a 4x4 matrix `a` and calls the `printDiagonalSums` function with this matrix and its size.

### SystemC Equivalent Code

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that incorporates the signals `matrix`, `principal`, and `secondary`:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Define constants for matrix size
static const int N = 4;
static const int SIZE = N * N;

// Module to calculate diagonal sums
SC_MODULE(DiagonalSumCalculator) {
    // Input port for the matrix (flattened as 1D array)
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];
    
    // Output ports for the diagonal sums
    sc_out<int> principal;
    sc_out<int> secondary;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSumCalculator) {
        // Sensitize the process to changes in matrix elements
        SC_METHOD(calculate_diagonals);
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            sensitive << matrix[i];
        }
    }

    // Method to calculate and assign diagonal sums
    void calculate_diagonals() {
        int principal_sum = 0, secondary_sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                if (i == j)
                    principal_sum += matrix[i * N + j].read();
                if ((i + j) == (N - 1))
                    secondary_sum += matrix[i * N + j].read();
            }
        }
        
        // Assign results to output ports
        principal.write(principal_sum);
        secondary.write(secondary_sum);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **Constants and Ports**: The module `DiagonalSumCalculator` has a single input port `matrix` and two output ports `principal` and `secondary`.
- **Constructor**: The constructor initializes an SC_METHOD called `calculate_diagonals` and sensibilizes it to changes in any of the elements of the `matrix`.
- **Method**: The `calculate_diagonals` method iterates over the flattened matrix to compute the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals, then assigns these sums to the respective output ports.

This SystemC code accurately reflects the logic of the original C++/C code and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.
