**Inputs:**
1. `vector<int>& v`: A reference to a vector of integers representing the sorted array where the search will be performed.
2. `int target`: An integer representing the element to be searched within the vector.

**Outputs:**
- Returns a boolean value indicating whether the target element was found (`true`) or not (`false`).

### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation

The provided C++ code implements an iterative binary search algorithm. Here's a detailed breakdown:

#### Function Declaration and Initialization
```cpp
bool binarySearch(vector<int>& v, int target) {
    int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
```
- `binarySearch` function takes a vector `v` and an integer `target`.
- Initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to represent the current range of indices being searched. `low` starts at 0, and `high` starts at the last index of the vector.

#### Main Search Loop
```cpp
while (low <= high) {
    int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
    if (v[mid] == target) {
        return true;
    }
    if (v[mid] > target)
        high = mid - 1;
    else
        low = mid + 1;
}
```
- This loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`, ensuring that the entire vector is searched.
- Calculates the midpoint `mid` using `(high - low) / 2 + low` to avoid potential overflow issues.
- Checks if the middle element `v[mid]` is equal to the target:
  - If yes, returns `true` indicating the target was found.
  - If no, checks if `v[mid]` is greater than the target:
    - If true, updates `high` to `mid - 1` to search the left half of the vector.
    - Otherwise, updates `low` to `mid + 1` to search the right half of the vector.

#### Return Statement
```cpp
return false;
```
- If the loop exits without finding the target, returns `false` indicating the target was not found.

### SystemC Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s how you can convert the given C++ binary search code into SystemC:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinarySearch) {
    sc_in<int> target;
    sc_out<bool> found;
    sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v;

    SC_CTOR(BinarySearch) {
        SC_THREAD(search_thread);
        sensitive << target;
    }

    void search_thread() {
        bool result = false;
        int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
            if (v[mid].read() == target) {
                result = true;
                break;
            }
            if (v[mid].read() > target)
                high = mid - 1;
            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }
        found.write(result);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    BinarySearch bs("binary_search");
    bs.target(8); // Example target value

    // Initialize the vector with some values
    bs.v.init(8);
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
        bs.v[i](i + 1);
    }

    sc_start();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **Module Definition**: `BinarySearch` is defined as a SystemC module with inputs `target` and `found`, and a vector of inputs `v`.
- **Constructor**: Registers a thread `search_thread` which will handle the search logic.
- **Thread Function**: 
  - Initializes `result` to `false`.
  - Sets `low` and `high` based on the size of the vector `v`.
  - Performs the binary search similar to the C++ version.
  - Writes the result to the `found` port once the search completes.
- **Main Function**: Instantiates the `BinarySearch` module, sets the target value, initializes the vector, and starts the simulation.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++ binary search algorithm and integrates seamlessly with the provided signals.
