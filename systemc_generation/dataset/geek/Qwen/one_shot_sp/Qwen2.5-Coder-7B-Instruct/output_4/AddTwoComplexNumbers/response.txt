The provided C++ program takes two complex numbers as input and returns their sum. Specifically:

- **Inputs**: Two complex numbers represented by `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`.
- **Outputs**: The sum of the two complex numbers, which includes the real part (`real_sum`) and the imaginary part (`imag_sum`).

### Line-by-Line Analysis

#### Declarations and Constructors
```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
```
These lines import necessary libraries and set up the standard namespace.

```cpp
class Complex 
{ 
public: int real, imaginary;
```
A user-defined class `Complex` is declared with public members `real` and `imaginary`.

```cpp
Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
{
    real = tempReal;
    imaginary = tempImaginary;
}
```
This is the constructor for the `Complex` class, initializing the real and imaginary parts.

#### Addition Function
```cpp
Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
{
    Complex temp;
    temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
    temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
    return temp;
}
```
This function takes two `Complex` objects as arguments, calculates their sum, and returns the result.

#### Main Function
```cpp
int main()
{
    Complex C1(3, 2);
    cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
    Complex C2(9, 5);
    cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
    Complex C3;
    C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
    cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
}
```
- Initializes two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` with given values.
- Prints both complex numbers.
- Calls `addComp()` to compute the sum and prints the result.

### SystemC Code Snippet
Here's the equivalent SystemC code that integrates with the provided signals:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum; // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum; // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read()); // Calculate and write the real part of the sum
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read()); // Calculate and write the imaginary part of the sum
    }
};
```

### Explanation
- **Inputs**: `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2` represent the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
- **Outputs**: `real_sum` and `imag_sum` represent the real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers.
- **Logic**: The `add` method reads the input values, computes the sum of the real parts and the imaginary parts separately, and writes the results to the respective output ports.

This SystemC module can now be integrated into a larger design or tested using a suitable testbench.
