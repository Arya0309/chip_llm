#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: None (The value `num` is hardcoded within the function.)
- **Outputs**: 
  - A single integer representing the factorial of the input number (`num`).

#### Detailed Explanation Line-by-Line

1. **Include Directive**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   ```
   - This directive includes the standard input-output stream library which allows for console input and output operations.

2. **Namespace Declaration**
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This statement simplifies the usage of names from the `std` namespace, allowing us to use `cout` directly instead of `std::cout`.

3. **Function Declaration**
   ```cpp
   unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
   ```
   - This declares a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as an argument and returns an unsigned integer.

4. **Variable Initialization**
   ```cpp
   int res = 1, i;
   ```
   - Initializes two variables: `res` (result) to 1 and `i` (loop counter) to 0.

5. **For Loop**
   ```cpp
   for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)
       res *= i;
   ```
   - A loop that starts at 2 and iterates up to `n`. During each iteration, `res` is multiplied by the current value of `i`.

6. **Return Statement**
   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```
   - Returns the computed factorial value stored in `res`.

7. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int num = 5;
       cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is "
           << factorial(num) << endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The entry point of the program where `num` is set to 5, and then the `factorial` function is called with `num` as an argument. The result is printed to the console.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

To convert this C++ code into SystemC, we need to create a module that accepts an input signal and produces an output signal. Here's how you can do it:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to compute the factorial of a number
SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port for the number
    sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
        // Process to compute the factorial
        SC_THREAD(compute_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    // Thread method to compute the factorial
    void compute_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read();
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Include Directive**
   ```cpp
   #include <systemc.h>
   ```
   - Includes the SystemC library which provides the necessary classes and functions for building SystemC models.

2. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
   ```
   - Defines a SystemC module named `Factorial`.

3. **Input and Output Ports**
   ```cpp
   sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port for the number
   sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial
   ```
   - Declares an input port `in` of type `unsigned int` and an output port `out` of type `unsigned int`.

4. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
   ```
   - Defines the constructor for the `Factorial` module.

5. **Thread Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_THREAD(compute_factorial);
   ```
   - Declares a thread method `compute_factorial` that will be executed whenever there is a change on the input port `in`.

6. **Thread Method**
   ```cpp
   void compute_factorial() {
       unsigned int n = in.read();
       unsigned int res = 1;
       for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
           res *= i;
       }
       out.write(res);
   }
   ```
   - Reads the input value, initializes `res` to 1, and computes the factorial using a loop. Finally, it writes the result to the output port `out`.

This SystemC code mirrors the functionality of the original C++ code, providing a way to compute the factorial of a number through SystemC signals.
