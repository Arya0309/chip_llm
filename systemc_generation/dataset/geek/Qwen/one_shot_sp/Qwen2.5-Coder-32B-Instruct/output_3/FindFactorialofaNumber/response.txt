### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input**: The input to this program is an integer `num` which is hardcoded as `5`. However, in the context of converting this into a SystemC module, we'll treat it as a dynamic input via `sc_in<unsigned int> in`.
- **Output**: The output is the factorial of the input number, which is printed to the console. In the SystemC version, this will be sent via `sc_out<unsigned int> out`.

### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation:
1. `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the standard input-output stream library, which is used for printing to the console.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line allows us to use standard library names without prefixing them with `std::`.
3. `unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)`: This line defines a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as an argument and returns an unsigned integer.
4. `int res = 1, i;`: Inside the `factorial` function, this line initializes two variables: `res` to store the result of the factorial calculation, initialized to `1`, and `i` as a loop counter.
5. `for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)`: This line starts a `for` loop that iterates from `2` to `n` inclusive. It uses `i` as the loop variable.
6. `res *= i;`: Inside the loop, this line multiplies `res` by `i` and stores the result back in `res`. This effectively calculates the factorial by multiplying all integers from `2` to `n`.
7. `return res;`: After the loop completes, this line returns the computed factorial value stored in `res`.
8. `int main()`: This line defines the `main` function, which is the entry point of the C++ program.
9. `int num = 5;`: This line declares and initializes the variable `num` to `5`. In the SystemC version, this value will be dynamically provided through the input signal.
10. `cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;`: This line prints the factorial of `num` to the console.
11. `return 0;`: This line indicates that the program has executed successfully and returns `0` to the operating system.

### SystemC Equivalent Code:
Below is the SystemC equivalent code that replicates the logic of the provided C++/C code. It uses `sc_in<unsigned int>` for input and `sc_out<unsigned int>` for output.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// SystemC module for calculating factorial
SC_MODULE(FactorialCalculator) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port for the number
    sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(FactorialCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate factorial
        SC_METHOD(calculate_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    // Method to calculate factorial
    void calculate_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read(); // Read the input number
        unsigned int res = 1;       // Initialize result to 1
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            res *= i; // Calculate factorial
        }
        out.write(res); // Write the result to the output port
    }
};

// Example testbench to demonstrate usage
SC_MODULE(Testbench) {
    sc_signal<unsigned int> num; // Signal to hold the input number
    sc_signal<unsigned int> fact; // Signal to hold the factorial result

    FactorialCalculator calc; // Instance of the FactorialCalculator module

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Testbench) : calc("calc") {
        calc.in(num); // Connect the input port of the calculator to the num signal
        calc.out(fact); // Connect the output port of the calculator to the fact signal

        // Process to drive the testbench
        SC_THREAD(run);
    }

    // Thread process to drive the testbench
    void run() {
        num.write(5); // Set the input number to 5
        wait(1, SC_NS); // Wait for some time to allow the calculation to complete
        cout << "Factorial of " << num.read() << " is " << fact.read() << endl; // Print the result
        sc_stop(); // Stop the simulation
    }
};

// Top-level module to instantiate testbench
int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    Testbench tb("tb"); // Instantiate the testbench
    sc_start(); // Start the simulation
    return 0;
}
```

This SystemC code defines a module `FactorialCalculator` that computes the factorial of a number provided via an input signal and writes the result to an output signal. A testbench is also included to demonstrate how the module can be used and to verify its functionality.
