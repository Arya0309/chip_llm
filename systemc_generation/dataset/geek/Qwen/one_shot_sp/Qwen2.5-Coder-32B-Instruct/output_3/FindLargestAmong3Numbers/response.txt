### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The program compares three integer values `a`, `b`, and `c`. In the given code, these values are hardcoded as `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = 11`.
- **Output**: The program outputs the largest of the three integers using `cout`.

### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation
1. **`#include <iostream>`**: This includes the standard input-output stream library which is necessary for using `cout` to print to the console.
2. **`using namespace std;`**: This line allows us to use standard library names without prefixing them with `std::`.
3. **`int main() {`**: This marks the beginning of the main function where the execution of the program starts.
4. **`int a = 1, b = 2, c = 11;`**: Three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared and initialized with the values `1`, `2`, and `11`, respectively.
5. **`if (a >= b) {`**: This checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
6. **`if (a >= c)`**: If the condition in step 5 is true, this nested `if` checks if `a` is also greater than or equal to `c`.
7. **`cout << a;`**: If both conditions in steps 5 and 6 are true, this prints the value of `a` as it is the largest.
8. **`else`**: If the condition in step 6 is false, this block executes.
9. **`cout << c;`**: Since `a` is not greater than or equal to `c`, but was greater than or equal to `b`, `c` must be the largest, so it gets printed.
10. **`else {`**: If the condition in step 5 is false, this block executes.
11. **`if (b >= c)`**: This checks if `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
12. **`cout << b;`**: If the condition in step 11 is true, `b` is the largest and gets printed.
13. **`else`**: If the condition in step 11 is false, this block executes.
14. **`cout << c;`**: Since `b` is not greater than or equal to `c`, `c` must be the largest, so it gets printed.
15. **`return 0;`**: This indicates that the program has executed successfully.
16. **`}`**: This closes the `main` function.

### SystemC Equivalent Code
Below is the SystemC equivalent of the provided C++/C code, incorporating the provided signals for seamless integration with an existing testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to find the largest among three numbers
SC_MODULE(FindLargest) {
    sc_in<int> a;     // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;     // Input port for the second number
    sc_in<int> c;     // Input port for the third number
    sc_out<int> largest; // Output port for the largest number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(FindLargest) {
        // Process to determine the largest number
        SC_METHOD(find_largest);
        sensitive << a << b << c;
    }

    // Method to find the largest number
    void find_largest() {
        int result;
        if (a.read() >= b.read()) {
            if (a.read() >= c.read())
                result = a.read();
            else
                result = c.read();
        } else {
            if (b.read() >= c.read())
                result = b.read();
            else
                result = c.read();
        }
        largest.write(result);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code
- **`SC_MODULE(FindLargest)`**: Declares a new SystemC module named `FindLargest`.
- **`sc_in<int> a, b, c;`**: These are the input ports for the three integers to compare.
- **`sc_out<int> largest;`**: This is the output port that will hold the largest of the three input integers.
- **`SC_CTOR(FindLargest)`**: The constructor for the `FindLargest` module.
- **`SC_METHOD(find_largest);`**: Declares a method `find_largest` that will be triggered when any of the input ports (`a`, `b`, or `c`) change.
- **`sensitive << a << b << c;`**: Specifies that the `find_largest` method should be sensitive to changes on ports `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- **`void find_largest()`**: This method contains the logic to determine the largest number among the inputs, similar to the C++/C code.
- **`largest.write(result);`**: Writes the determined largest number to the `largest` output port.
