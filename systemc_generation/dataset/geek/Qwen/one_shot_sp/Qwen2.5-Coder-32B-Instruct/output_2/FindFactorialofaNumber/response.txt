### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input**: An integer `n` for which the factorial is to be calculated. In the provided code, this is hardcoded as `num = 5`.
- **Output**: The factorial of the input number `n`, which is printed to the console.

### Line-by-Line Explanation:
1. `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the standard input-output stream library, which is necessary for using `cout` to print to the console.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line allows us to use standard library names directly without the `std::` prefix.
3. `unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)`: This line declares a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as input and returns an unsigned integer. This function calculates the factorial of `n`.
4. `int res = 1, i;`: Inside the `factorial` function, we declare an integer variable `res` and initialize it to 1. We also declare an integer `i` for use in the loop.
5. `for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)`: This line starts a for loop that iterates from 2 to `n` inclusive. The loop variable `i` starts at 2 because multiplying by 1 has no effect on the result.
6. `res *= i;`: Inside the loop, we multiply the current value of `res` by `i` and store the result back in `res`. This accumulates the product of all integers from 2 to `n`.
7. `return res;`: After the loop completes, the function returns the computed factorial stored in `res`.
8. `int main()`: This line defines the main function where the execution of the program begins.
9. `int num = 5;`: Inside the `main` function, we declare and initialize an integer variable `num` to 5.
10. `cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;`: This line prints the string "Factorial of ", followed by the value of `num`, followed by the string " is ", and then the result of calling the `factorial` function with `num` as the argument.
11. `return 0;`: This line indicates that the program has executed successfully and returns 0 to the operating system.

### SystemC Code Snippet:
Below is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that captures the same behavior as the original C++/C code. It uses the provided `sc_in<unsigned int>` and `sc_out<unsigned int>` signals for input and output.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to calculate factorial of a number
SC_MODULE(FactorialCalculator) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port for the number
    sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(FactorialCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate factorial
        SC_METHOD(calculate_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    // Method to calculate the factorial
    void calculate_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read();
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }
};

// Example usage in a testbench
int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    sc_signal<unsigned int> num;  // Signal for input number
    sc_signal<unsigned int> fact; // Signal for factorial result

    FactorialCalculator calc("FactorialCalculator");
    calc.in(num);
    calc.out(fact);

    sc_start(); // Start simulation

    num.write(5); // Set input number to 5
    sc_start(1, SC_NS); // Wait for 1 nanosecond for the calculation to complete

    cout << "Factorial of " << num.read() << " is " << fact.read() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code:
- **Module Definition**: The `FactorialCalculator` module is defined with two ports: `in` for the input number and `out` for the output factorial.
- **Constructor**: The constructor sets up a method (`calculate_factorial`) that triggers whenever the input signal changes.
- **Factorial Calculation Method**: The `calculate_factorial` method reads the input number, computes its factorial using a loop, and writes the result to the output port.
- **Testbench**: In `sc_main`, we instantiate the `FactorialCalculator` module, connect its ports to signals, and simulate the process by writing an input value and reading the output after a delay to allow the computation to complete.
