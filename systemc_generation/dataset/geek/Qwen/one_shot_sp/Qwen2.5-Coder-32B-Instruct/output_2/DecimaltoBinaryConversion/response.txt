### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input:** An integer `n` which is the decimal number to be converted to binary.
- **Output:** The binary representation of the integer `n`, printed to the console.

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Function Declaration:**
   ```cpp
   void decToBinary(int n)
   ```
   - This function takes an integer `n` as input and converts it to its binary form.

2. **Binary Storage Array:**
   ```cpp
   int binaryNum[32];
   ```
   - An array `binaryNum` of size 32 is declared to store the binary digits. The size 32 is chosen to accommodate the binary representation of any 32-bit integer.

3. **Counter Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   int i = 0;
   ```
   - A counter `i` is initialized to 0. This counter keeps track of the current position in the `binaryNum` array.

4. **Conversion Loop:**
   ```cpp
   while (n > 0) {
       binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
       n = n / 2;
       i++;
   }
   ```
   - This loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - Inside the loop, the remainder of `n` divided by 2 (`n % 2`) is stored in the `binaryNum` array at index `i`.
   - `n` is then divided by 2 (`n = n / 2`), effectively removing the least significant bit.
   - The counter `i` is incremented to move to the next position in the array.

5. **Printing Binary Number:**
   ```cpp
   for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
       cout << binaryNum[j];
   ```
   - This loop prints the elements of the `binaryNum` array in reverse order, starting from the last stored element (which corresponds to the most significant bit of the binary number).

6. **Main Function:**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int n = 10;
       decToBinary(n);
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function initializes `n` to 10.
   - It calls the `decToBinary` function to print the binary representation of 10.
   - The program returns 0 upon successful execution.

### SystemC Equivalent Code:
Below is the equivalent SystemC code that performs the same task using the provided `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<int>` signals. This code is designed to work within a SystemC simulation environment and can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to convert decimal to binary
SC_MODULE(DecToBinConverter) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;       // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out;  // Output port for the binary number (as an integer)

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DecToBinConverter) {
        // Process to perform conversion
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    // Method to convert decimal to binary
    void convert() {
        int n = dec_in.read();
        int binaryNum[32];
        int i = 0;

        // Conversion loop
        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }

        // Calculate the binary number as an integer
        int binary_result = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            binary_result = binary_result * 2 + binaryNum[j];
        }

        // Write the result to the output port
        binary_out.write(binary_result);
    }
};

// Example usage in a simple testbench
int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    sc_signal<int> dec_in;
    sc_signal<int> binary_out;

    DecToBinConverter converter("converter");
    converter.dec_in(dec_in);
    converter.binary_out(binary_out);

    sc_start();

    // Test with a sample value
    dec_in.write(10);
    sc_start(10, SC_NS);  // Wait for some time to see the output

    cout << "Decimal: " << dec_in.read() << " -> Binary: " << binary_out.read() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **Module Declaration:**
  - `DecToBinConverter` is a SystemC module that performs the decimal to binary conversion.
  
- **Ports:**
  - `dec_in`: An input port to receive the decimal number.
  - `binary_out`: An output port to send the binary number (represented as an integer).

- **Constructor:**
  - Registers the `convert` method to be triggered whenever there is a change in `dec_in`.

- **Convert Method:**
  - Reads the decimal number from `dec_in`.
  - Uses the same conversion logic as the C++ code to compute the binary representation.
  - Constructs the binary number as an integer by iterating through the `binaryNum` array.
  - Writes the computed binary number to `binary_out`.

- **Testbench:**
  - Instantiates the `DecToBinConverter` module.
  - Connects the input and output ports to signals.
  - Simulates the module with a sample input (10) and prints the result.

This SystemC code faithfully replicates the logic of the original C++ code and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow with the specified input and output ports.
