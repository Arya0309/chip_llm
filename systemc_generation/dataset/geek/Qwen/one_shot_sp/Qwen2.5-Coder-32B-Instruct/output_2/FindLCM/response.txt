### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Inputs**: Two integers `a` and `b`. In the given code, these are hardcoded as 15 and 20, respectively.
- **Output**: The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the two integers, printed to the console.

### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation:
1. `#include <iostream>`: Includes the standard input-output stream library, which is used for printing the result to the console.
2. `using namespace std;`: Allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.
3. `int main()`: The entry point of the program where execution starts.
4. `int a = 15, b = 20, max_num, flag = 1;`: Declares three integer variables. `a` and `b` are initialized to 15 and 20, respectively. `max_num` is uninitialized, and `flag` is set to 1, indicating that the loop should run initially.
5. `max_num = (a > b) ? a : b;`: Uses the ternary operator to assign the larger of `a` and `b` to `max_num`. This is the starting point for checking the LCM.
6. `while (flag) { ... }`: Begins a loop that continues until `flag` becomes 0.
7. `if (max_num % a == 0 && max_num % b == 0) { ... }`: Checks if `max_num` is divisible by both `a` and `b`. If true, this means `max_num` is the LCM.
8. `cout << "LCM of " << a << " and " << b << " is " << max_num;`: Prints the LCM to the console.
9. `break;`: Exits the loop once the LCM is found.
10. `++max_num;`: Increments `max_num` by 1 in each iteration, moving to the next number to check.
11. `return 0;`: Indicates successful termination of the program.

### SystemC Equivalent Code:
Below is the SystemC code that implements the same logic as the provided C++/C code. It uses the signals `a`, `b`, and `lcm_result` for integration with the existing testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to calculate the LCM of two numbers
SC_MODULE(LCMCalculator) {
    sc_in<int> a;          // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;          // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> lcm_result; // Output port for the LCM

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LCMCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate LCM
        SC_METHOD(calculate_lcm);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to calculate the LCM
    void calculate_lcm() {
        int num_a = a.read();
        int num_b = b.read();
        int max_num = (num_a > num_b) ? num_a : num_b;
        int flag = 1;

        while (flag) {
            if (max_num % num_a == 0 && max_num % num_b == 0) {
                lcm_result.write(max_num);
                flag = 0; // Exit the loop
            } else {
                ++max_num;
            }
        }
    }
};

// Example top-level module for simulation
SC_MODULE(TopLevel) {
    sc_signal<int> a;
    sc_signal<int> b;
    sc_signal<int> lcm_result;

    LCMCalculator lcm_calculator;

    SC_CTOR(TopLevel) : lcm_calculator("lcm_calculator") {
        lcm_calculator.a(a);
        lcm_calculator.b(b);
        lcm_calculator.lcm_result(lcm_result);

        // Initialization process
        SC_THREAD(initialize);
    }

    void initialize() {
        a.write(15); // Set the value of a
        b.write(20); // Set the value of b
        wait(1, SC_NS); // Wait for the calculation to complete
        cout << "LCM of " << a.read() << " and " << b.read() << " is " << lcm_result.read() << endl;
        sc_stop(); // Stop the simulation
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    TopLevel top("top");
    sc_start();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code:
- **Module Definition**: `LCMCalculator` is defined as a SystemC module with input ports `a` and `b` and an output port `lcm_result`.
- **Constructor**: The constructor sets up a method `calculate_lcm` that is sensitive to changes in `a` and `b`.
- **Method `calculate_lcm`**: Implements the logic to compute the LCM, similar to the C++/C code. It reads the values from the input ports, calculates the LCM, and writes the result to the output port.
- **Top-Level Module**: `TopLevel` initializes the signals and connects them to the `LCMCalculator` module. It also contains an initialization process to set the input values and print the result after computation.
- **Simulation Control**: `sc_main` function creates an instance of `TopLevel` and starts the simulation. The simulation stops after calculating the LCM and printing the result.
