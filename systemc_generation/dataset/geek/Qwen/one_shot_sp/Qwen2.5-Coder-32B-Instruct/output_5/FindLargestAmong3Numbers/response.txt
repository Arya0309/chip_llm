### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Inputs**: Three integer values `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- **Output**: The largest of the three integers is printed to the console.

### Line-by-Line Explanation:
1. **`#include <iostream>`**: This line includes the input-output stream library, which is necessary for using `cout` to print output to the console.
2. **`using namespace std;`**: This line allows us to use standard library names without the `std::` prefix.
3. **`int main() {`**: This is the main function where the execution of the program begins.
4. **`int a = 1, b = 2, c = 11;`**: Here, three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are declared and initialized with the values 1, 2, and 11, respectively.
5. **`if (a >= b) {`**: This condition checks whether `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
6. **`if (a >= c)`**: If the previous condition is true, this nested condition checks whether `a` is also greater than or equal to `c`.
7. **`cout << a;`**: If both conditions in steps 5 and 6 are true, `a` is the largest number, and it is printed to the console.
8. **`else`**: If the condition in step 6 is false, this block is executed.
9. **`cout << c;`**: Since `a` is not greater than or equal to `c`, `c` is the largest number, and it is printed to the console.
10. **`else`**: If the condition in step 5 is false, this block is executed.
11. **`if (b >= c)`**: This condition checks whether `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
12. **`cout << b;`**: If the condition in step 11 is true, `b` is the largest number, and it is printed to the console.
13. **`else`**: If the condition in step 11 is false, this block is executed.
14. **`cout << c;`**: Since `b` is not greater than or equal to `c`, `c` is the largest number, and it is printed to the console.
15. **`return 0;`**: The program returns 0, indicating successful execution.

### Equivalent SystemC Code:
Below is the SystemC code that replicates the behavior of the provided C++/C code using the specified signals.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to find the largest among three numbers
SC_MODULE(FindLargest) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_in<int> c;  // Input port for the third number
    sc_out<int> largest; // Output port for the largest number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(FindLargest) {
        // Process to determine the largest number
        SC_METHOD(find_largest);
        sensitive << a << b << c;
    }

    // Method to find the largest number
    void find_largest() {
        int result;
        if (a.read() >= b.read()) {
            if (a.read() >= c.read())
                result = a.read();
            else
                result = c.read();
        } else {
            if (b.read() >= c.read())
                result = b.read();
            else
                result = c.read();
        }
        largest.write(result);
    }
};

```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **`SC_MODULE(FindLargest)`**: Defines a new SystemC module named `FindLargest`.
- **`sc_in<int> a;`, `sc_in<int> b;`, `sc_in<int> c;`**: These lines declare three input ports for the integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- **`sc_out<int> largest;`**: Declares an output port for the largest number.
- **`SC_CTOR(FindLargest)`**: Constructor for the `FindLargest` module.
- **`SC_METHOD(find_largest);`**: Registers the `find_largest` method to be called whenever any of the inputs change.
- **`sensitive << a << b << c;`**: Specifies that the `find_largest` method should be triggered whenever there is a change in any of the inputs `a`, `b`, or `c`.
- **`void find_largest()`**: This method contains the logic to determine the largest of the three numbers, similar to the original C++/C code. It reads the values from the input ports, performs the comparisons, and writes the result to the output port `largest`.

This SystemC code can be integrated into a larger simulation environment and used for high-level synthesis, adhering to the provided signal definitions.
