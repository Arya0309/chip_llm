### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Inputs**: 
  - `principal`: The initial amount of money invested or loaned.
  - `rate`: The annual interest rate (in percentage).
  - `time`: The time period for which the interest is calculated (in years).
- **Outputs**:
  - `CI`: The compound interest calculated based on the formula.

### Line-by-Line Explanation:
1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This line includes a header file that contains definitions for many of the standard C++ libraries, allowing the use of functions like `cout` and `pow`.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line tells the compiler to use the standard namespace, avoiding the need to prefix standard library names with `std::`.
3. `int main()` : This is the main function where the execution of the program begins.
4. `double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;`: Initializes the variables `principal`, `rate`, and `time` with fixed values. These represent the principal amount, interest rate, and time period respectively.
5. `double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));`: Calculates the total amount `A` after applying compound interest using the formula \( A = P \times (1 + \frac{r}{100})^t \).
6. `double CI = A - principal;`: Computes the compound interest `CI` by subtracting the principal from the total amount `A`.
7. `cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;`: Outputs the calculated compound interest to the console.
8. `return 0;`: Indicates successful termination of the program.

### SystemC Equivalent Code:
Below is the SystemC equivalent of the provided C++/C code, incorporating the specified signals for seamless integration with an existing testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to calculate compound interest
SC_MODULE(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
    sc_in<double> principal;  // Input port for the principal amount
    sc_in<double> rate;       // Input port for the interest rate
    sc_in<double> time;       // Input port for the time period
    sc_out<double> ci;        // Output port for the compound interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterestCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate compound interest
        SC_METHOD(calculateCompoundInterest);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculateCompoundInterest() {
        double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
        double CI = A - principal.read();
        ci.write(CI);
    }
};

// Example testbench (not part of the required code but useful for testing)
SC_MODULE(Testbench) {
    sc_signal<double> principal_tb;
    sc_signal<double> rate_tb;
    sc_signal<double> time_tb;
    sc_signal<double> ci_tb;

    CompoundInterestCalculator cic_inst;

    SC_CTOR(Testbench) : cic_inst("CompoundInterestCalculator") {
        cic_inst.principal(principal_tb);
        cic_inst.rate(rate_tb);
        cic_inst.time(time_tb);
        cic_inst.ci(ci_tb);

        // Test process
        SC_THREAD(test);
    }

    void test() {
        // Set initial values
        principal_tb = 10000;
        rate_tb = 5;
        time_tb = 2;
        wait(1, SC_NS); // Wait for one nanosecond to let the calculation happen

        // Print the result
        cout << "Compound interest is " << ci_tb.read() << endl;

        sc_stop(); // Stop the simulation
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    Testbench tb("Testbench");
    sc_start(); // Start the simulation
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **Module Definition**: `CompoundInterestCalculator` is a SystemC module that calculates compound interest.
- **Ports**: It has three input ports (`principal`, `rate`, `time`) and one output port (`ci`).
- **Constructor**: The constructor sets up a method (`calculateCompoundInterest`) that triggers whenever any of the input ports change.
- **Method**: `calculateCompoundInterest` reads the values from the input ports, performs the compound interest calculation, and writes the result to the output port.
- **Testbench**: An example testbench is included to demonstrate how the module can be instantiated and tested. It sets specific values for the inputs, waits for the calculation to occur, and then prints the result.

This SystemC code accurately mirrors the functionality of the original C++/C code while adhering to the provided signal specifications for integration into an existing testbench.
