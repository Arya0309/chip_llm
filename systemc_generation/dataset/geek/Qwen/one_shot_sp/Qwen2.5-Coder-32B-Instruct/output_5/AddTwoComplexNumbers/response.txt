Let's start by analyzing the provided C++ code.

### Analysis of the Provided C++ Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - Two complex numbers, each represented by their real and imaginary parts.
- **Outputs**:
  - A single complex number which is the sum of the two input complex numbers.

#### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Imports and Namespace**:
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes all standard libraries and uses the standard namespace.

2. **Complex Class Definition**:
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
   ```
   - A `Complex` class is defined with two public integer members: `real` and `imaginary`.

3. **Constructor**:
   ```cpp
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the `real` and `imaginary` parts of the complex number. Default values are 0 if no arguments are provided.

4. **Method to Add Two Complex Numbers**:
   ```cpp
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary;
           return temp;
       }
   ```
   - The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects as parameters, adds their respective real and imaginary parts, and returns a new `Complex` object representing the sum.

5. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
   
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
   
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
   
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - Two `Complex` objects, `C1` and `C2`, are instantiated with specific values.
   - These values are printed to the console.
   - The `addComp` method is called to add `C1` and `C2`, and the result is stored in `C3`.
   - The sum is then printed to the console.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that performs the same functionality as the provided C++ code. It utilizes the specified signals for integration with the testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;     // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;     // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;     // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;     // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        int real_part_sum = real1.read() + real2.read();
        int imag_part_sum = imag1.read() + imag2.read();
        real_sum.write(real_part_sum);
        imag_sum.write(imag_part_sum);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Module Definition**:
  - `SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder)` defines a SystemC module named `ComplexAdder`.

- **Signal Declarations**:
  - Four input signals (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`) are declared to receive the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
  - Two output signals (`real_sum`, `imag_sum`) are declared to send the real and imaginary parts of the sum.

- **Constructor**:
  - `SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder)` is the constructor for the `ComplexAdder` module.
  - `SC_METHOD(add)` registers the `add` method as a SystemC method.
  - `sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;` specifies that the `add` method should be triggered whenever any of the input signals change.

- **Addition Method**:
  - The `add` method reads the values from the input signals, computes the sum of the real and imaginary parts, and writes the results to the output signals.

This SystemC code snippet can be integrated into a larger design and tested using the provided testbench signals.
