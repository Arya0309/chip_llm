### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input:** An integer `n` for which the factorial is to be calculated. In the provided code, this is hardcoded as `num = 5`.
- **Output:** The factorial of the input number `n`, which is printed to the console.

### Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation:
1. **Include Directive:**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   ```
   - This includes the standard input-output stream library which is used for printing to the console.

2. **Namespace Declaration:**
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This allows us to use standard library names directly without prefixing them with `std::`.

3. **Function Definition:**
   ```cpp
   unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
   ```
   - This defines a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as an argument and returns an unsigned integer.

4. **Variable Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   int res = 1, i;
   ```
   - Initializes two variables: `res` to store the result of the factorial calculation, starting at 1, and `i` as a loop counter.

5. **For Loop:**
   ```cpp
   for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)
       res *= i;
   ```
   - A loop that iterates from 2 to `n`, multiplying `res` by each value of `i` in turn to compute the factorial.

6. **Return Statement:**
   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```
   - Returns the computed factorial value stored in `res`.

7. **Main Function:**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   ```
   - The entry point of the program.

8. **Variable Declaration:**
   ```cpp
   int num = 5;
   ```
   - Declares an integer variable `num` and initializes it to 5. This is the number for which the factorial will be calculated.

9. **Output Statement:**
   ```cpp
   cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;
   ```
   - Uses `cout` to print the string "Factorial of ", the value of `num`, the string " is ", and the result of the `factorial` function called with `num` as the argument.

10. **Return Statement:**
    ```cpp
    return 0;
    ```
    - Indicates that the program has executed successfully.

### SystemC Equivalent Code:
Below is the SystemC equivalent of the provided C++/C code, incorporating the specified `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to calculate factorial
SC_MODULE(FactorialCalculator) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port for the number
    sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(FactorialCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate factorial
        SC_METHOD(calculate_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    // Method to calculate factorial
    void calculate_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read();
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }
};

// Example testbench to demonstrate the FactorialCalculator module
SC_MODULE(Testbench) {
    sc_signal<unsigned int> num;  // Signal for input number
    sc_signal<unsigned int> fact; // Signal for factorial result

    FactorialCalculator calc; // Instance of the FactorialCalculator module

    SC_CTOR(Testbench) : calc("calc") {
        calc.in(num);  // Connect input signal to calculator
        calc.out(fact); // Connect output signal from calculator

        // Process to drive the testbench
        SC_THREAD(run);
    }

    void run() {
        num.write(5); // Set input number to 5
        wait(1, SC_NS); // Wait for 1 nanosecond
        cout << "Factorial of " << num.read() << " is " << fact.read() << endl;
        sc_stop(); // Stop simulation
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    Testbench tb("tb"); // Instantiate the testbench
    sc_start(); // Start the simulation
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code:
- **Module Definition (`FactorialCalculator`):**
  - Contains two ports: `in` for receiving the input number and `out` for sending the computed factorial.
  - The `calculate_factorial` method reads the input number, computes its factorial using a loop, and writes the result to the output port.

- **Testbench (`Testbench`):**
  - Instantiates the `FactorialCalculator` module and connects its ports to internal signals `num` and `fact`.
  - The `run` thread sets the input number to 5, waits for 1 nanosecond to allow the calculation to complete, prints the result, and stops the simulation.

This SystemC code mirrors the logic of the original C++/C code while being suitable for integration into a larger SystemC design or high-level synthesis flow.
