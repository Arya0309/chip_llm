### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The program takes two complex numbers as input. Each complex number consists of a real part and an imaginary part.
- **Outputs**: The program outputs the sum of the two complex numbers, which is also a complex number consisting of a real part and an imaginary part.

### Detailed Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation

1. **Imports and Namespace**:
   ```cpp
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes all standard C++ libraries and sets the `std` namespace, allowing us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.

2. **Complex Class Definition**:
   ```cpp
   class Complex 
   { 
       public: int real, imaginary;
   ```
   - A user-defined class `Complex` is declared with two public integer members: `real` and `imaginary`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.

3. **Constructor**:
   ```cpp
       Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)
       {
           real = tempReal;
           imaginary = tempImaginary;
       }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the `real` and `imaginary` members of the `Complex` object with the values provided as arguments. Default values of `0` are used if no arguments are given.

4. **addComp Method**:
   ```cpp
       Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
       {
           Complex temp;
           temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;
           temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);
           return temp;
       }
   ```
   - This method takes two `Complex` objects as parameters, adds their respective real and imaginary parts, and returns a new `Complex` object containing the result.

5. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       Complex C1(3, 2);
       cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C2(9, 5);
       cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;
       Complex C3;
       C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);
       cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function creates two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` with specified real and imaginary parts.
   - It prints the complex numbers.
   - It then calls the `addComp` method to add `C1` and `C2`, storing the result in `C3`.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the two complex numbers.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that performs the same operation as the provided C++/C code. It uses the signals defined for integration with the testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;       // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;       // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;       // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;       // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;   // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;   // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        // Reading the input values
        int r1 = real1.read();
        int i1 = imag1.read();
        int r2 = real2.read();
        int i2 = imag2.read();

        // Calculating the sum of the real and imaginary parts
        int r_sum = r1 + r2;
        int i_sum = i1 + i2;

        // Writing the results to the output ports
        real_sum.write(r_sum);
        imag_sum.write(i_sum);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **Module Declaration**: `SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder)` defines a SystemC module named `ComplexAdder`.
- **Ports**: The module has four input ports (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`) and two output ports (`real_sum`, `imag_sum`). These correspond to the real and imaginary parts of the two input complex numbers and the resulting sum.
- **Constructor**: The constructor initializes the module and specifies that the `add` method should be called whenever any of the input ports change.
- **add Method**: This method reads the values from the input ports, computes the sum of the real and imaginary parts, and writes the results to the output ports.

This SystemC module can be integrated into a larger SystemC design and tested using the provided testbench signals.
