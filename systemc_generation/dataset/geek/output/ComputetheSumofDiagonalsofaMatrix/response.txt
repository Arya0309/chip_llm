### Analysis of Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs:
- `mat[][]`: A 2D integer array representing the matrix.
- `n`: An integer representing the size of the square matrix.

#### Outputs:
- `principal`: Sum of the elements on the principal diagonal of the matrix.
- `secondary`: Sum of the elements on the secondary diagonal of the matrix.

#### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Constants and Function Definition:**
   ```cpp
   const int MAX = 100;
   
   void printDiagonalSums(int mat[][MAX], int n)
   ```
   - `MAX` is defined as 100, which sets the maximum size of the matrix.
   - `printDiagonalSums` is a function that calculates the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals of a square matrix `mat` of size `n`.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   int principal = 0, secondary = 0;
   ```
   - Two integer variables, `principal` and `secondary`, are initialized to zero. These will hold the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively.

3. **Nested Loops for Summation:**
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
   {
       for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
       {
           if (i == j)
               principal += mat[i][j];
           if ((i + j) == (n - 1))
               secondary += mat[i][j];
       }
   }
   ```
   - The outer loop iterates over each row of the matrix.
   - The inner loop iterates over each column of the matrix.
   - For each element `mat[i][j]`:
     - If `i == j`, the element is on the principal diagonal, and its value is added to `principal`.
     - If `(i + j) == (n - 1)`, the element is on the secondary diagonal, and its value is added to `secondary`.

4. **Output the Results:**
   ```cpp
   cout << "Principal Diagonal:" << principal << endl;
   cout << "Secondary Diagonal:" << secondary << endl;
   ```
   - The sums of the principal and secondary diagonals are printed to the console.

5. **Main Function:**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int a[][MAX] = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}};
       printDiagonalSums(a, 4);
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - A 4x4 matrix `a` is defined and initialized.
   - The `printDiagonalSums` function is called with this matrix and its size (4).

### SystemC Code Equivalent

Below is the equivalent SystemC code that captures the same logic and integrates with the provided signals:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Define constants for matrix size
static const int N = 4;
static const int SIZE = N * N;

// SystemC module to calculate diagonal sums
SC_MODULE(DiagonalSumCalculator) {
    // Input port for the matrix (flattened as 1D array)
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];
    
    // Output ports for the sums of principal and secondary diagonals
    sc_out<int> principal;
    sc_out<int> secondary;

    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSumCalculator) {
        // Register the process with sensitivity list
        SC_METHOD(calculate_diagonals);
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            sensitive << matrix[i];
        }
    }

    // Method to calculate the sums of the diagonals
    void calculate_diagonals() {
        int principal_sum = 0;
        int secondary_sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                int index = i * N + j;
                if (i == j) {
                    principal_sum += matrix[index].read();
                }
                if ((i + j) == (N - 1)) {
                    secondary_sum += matrix[index].read();
                }
            }
        }

        // Write results to output ports
        principal.write(principal_sum);
        secondary.write(secondary_sum);
    }
};

```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **Constants:**
  - `N` is set to 4, indicating a 4x4 matrix.
  - `SIZE` is calculated as `N * N` to represent the flattened size of the matrix.

- **Module Definition:**
  - `DiagonalSumCalculator` is a SystemC module that computes the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals of a matrix.
  
- **Ports:**
  - `matrix[]`: An array of `sc_in<int>` ports representing the input matrix (flattened as a 1D array).
  - `principal`: An `sc_out<int>` port to output the sum of the principal diagonal.
  - `secondary`: An `sc_out<int>` port to output the sum of the secondary diagonal.

- **Constructor:**
  - The constructor registers the `calculate_diagonals` method as a sensitive process. It is triggered whenever any element of the `matrix` changes.

- **Method `calculate_diagonals`:**
  - This method iterates over the matrix elements (flattened) and calculates the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals using similar logic to the C++/C code.
  - The results are written to the `principal` and `secondary` output ports.
