### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Inputs**:
  - A sorted vector `v` of integers.
  - An integer `target` to be searched within the vector `v`.
- **Outputs**:
  - A boolean value indicating whether the `target` is present in the vector `v`.

#### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation:
1. **Include Libraries and Namespace**:
   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - This includes all standard C++ libraries and sets the standard namespace to `std`.

2. **Function Definition: `binarySearch`**:
   ```cpp
   bool binarySearch(vector<int>& v, int target) {
   ```
   - Declares a function named `binarySearch` that takes a reference to a vector `v` of integers and an integer `target`. It returns a boolean value.

3. **Initialize Search Range**:
   ```cpp
   int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
   ```
   - Initializes two integer variables, `low` and `high`, which represent the current search range within the vector `v`. Initially, `low` is set to 0, and `high` is set to the last index of the vector.

4. **Binary Search Loop**:
   ```cpp
   while (low <= high) {
   ```
   - Starts a loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

5. **Calculate Midpoint**:
   ```cpp
   int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
   ```
   - Calculates the midpoint index `mid` of the current search range. This avoids potential overflow issues that could occur with `(low + high) / 2`.

6. **Check Midpoint Value**:
   ```cpp
   if (v[mid] == target) {
       return true;
   }
   ```
   - Checks if the element at the midpoint index `mid` is equal to the `target`. If it is, the function returns `true`, indicating that the `target` has been found.

7. **Adjust Search Range Based on Midpoint Value**:
   ```cpp
   if (v[mid] > target)
       high = mid - 1;
   else
       low = mid + 1;
   ```
   - If the element at `mid` is greater than the `target`, it means the `target` must be in the lower half of the vector. Therefore, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - If the element at `mid` is less than the `target`, it means the `target` must be in the upper half of the vector. Therefore, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.

8. **Return False if Target Not Found**:
   ```cpp
   return false;
   ```
   - If the loop exits without finding the `target`, the function returns `false`, indicating that the `target` is not present in the vector.

9. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
   int main() {
       vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};
       int target = 8;
       if (binarySearch(v, target)) {
           cout << target << " found.";
       } else {
           cout << target << " NOT found.";
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - Initializes a vector `v` with sorted integers and a `target` integer.
   - Calls the `binarySearch` function with `v` and `target` as arguments.
   - Prints whether the `target` was found or not based on the result returned by `binarySearch`.

### Equivalent SystemC Code Snippet

Below is a SystemC code snippet that implements the same binary search logic. This code can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// BinarySearch module
SC_MODULE(BinarySearch) {
    // Input port for the target value
    sc_in<int> target;
    // Output port indicating whether the target is found
    sc_out<bool> found;
    // Input vector (as an array for simplicity)
    int v[8];
    int size;

    // Process to perform binary search
    void doBinarySearch() {
        int low = 0, high = size - 1;
        bool result = false;

        while (low <= high && !result) {
            int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
            if (v[mid] == target.read()) {
                result = true;
            } else if (v[mid] > target.read()) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        found.write(result);
    }

    // Constructor to register the process
    SC_CTOR(BinarySearch) : size(8) {
        SC_METHOD(doBinarySearch);
        sensitive << target;
    }
};

// Testbench module to drive inputs and capture outputs
SC_MODULE(Testbench) {
    // Signals to connect with BinarySearch
    sc_signal<int> target;
    sc_signal<bool> found;

    // Instance of BinarySearch
    BinarySearch searcher;

    // Process to drive inputs and print outputs
    void driveAndPrint() {
        // Initialize the vector in the searcher
        int values[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
            searcher.v[i] = values[i];
        }

        // Set the target to search
        target = 8;

        // Wait for one delta cycle to let the searcher process
        wait(1, SC_NS);

        // Print the result
        if (found.read()) {
            cout << target.read() << " found." << endl;
        } else {
            cout << target.read() << " NOT found." << endl;
        }
    }

    // Constructor to register the process
    SC_CTOR(Testbench) : searcher("searcher") {
        // Connecting signals to the searcher ports
        searcher.target(target);
        searcher.found(found);

        // Registering the driveAndPrint process
        SC_THREAD(driveAndPrint);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    Testbench tb("tb");
    sc_start(); // Start simulation
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation of the SystemC Code:
- **BinarySearch Module**:
  - Contains an input port `target` to receive the integer to be searched.
  - Contains an output port `found` to indicate whether the target is found.
  - The `doBinarySearch` method implements the binary search logic similar to the C++ version.
  - The constructor registers the `doBinarySearch` method to be sensitive to changes on the `target` signal.

- **Testbench Module**:
  - Initializes the vector `v` inside the `BinarySearch` instance.
  - Sets the `target` signal to the integer to be searched.
  - Waits for one delta cycle to allow the `BinarySearch` module to process the input.
  - Reads the `found` signal and prints whether the target was found or not.

This SystemC code snippet faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.
