### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The code does not take any explicit input from the user. However, there is a hardcoded value `n` which can be considered as an implicit input. In this case, `n` is set to 5.
- **Outputs**: The program prints the multiplication table of the number `n` from 1 to 10. For `n = 5`, the output will be:
  ```
  5 * 1 = 5
  5 * 2 = 10
  5 * 3 = 15
  5 * 4 = 20
  5 * 5 = 25
  5 * 6 = 30
  5 * 7 = 35
  5 * 8 = 40
  5 * 9 = 45
  5 * 10 = 50
  ```

#### Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation

1. `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the standard input-output stream library which is necessary for using `cout` to print output to the console.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.
3. `int main()`: This is the main function where the execution of the program begins.
4. `int n = 5;`: This line declares an integer variable `n` and initializes it with the value 5. This value represents the number whose multiplication table we want to print.
5. `for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i)`: This is a for loop that initializes `i` to 1 and continues to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10, incrementing `i` by 1 after each iteration.
6. `cout << n << " * " << i << " = " << n * i << endl;`: Inside the loop, this line prints the current multiplication step in the format "n * i = result". `endl` is used to move to the next line after printing each step.
7. `return 0;`: This line indicates that the program has executed successfully and returns 0 to the operating system.

### Equivalent SystemC Code Snippet

Below is the SystemC equivalent of the provided C++/C code. Note that SystemC is typically used for modeling hardware systems, so this code is more illustrative than practical for hardware synthesis, but it demonstrates how to translate procedural logic into a SystemC module.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MultiplicationTable) {
    SC_CTOR(MultiplicationTable) {
        SC_THREAD(print_table);
    }

    void print_table() {
        int n = 5; // Number for which the multiplication table is printed
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
            cout << n << " * " << i << " = " << n * i << endl;
        }
        sc_stop(); // Stop the simulation after printing the table
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    MultiplicationTable mt("MultiplicationTable");
    sc_start();
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation of the SystemC Code

1. **Include SystemC Header**: `#include <systemc.h>` includes the necessary SystemC library.
2. **Module Declaration**: `SC_MODULE(MultiplicationTable)` defines a new SystemC module named `MultiplicationTable`.
3. **Constructor**: `SC_CTOR(MultiplicationTable)` is the constructor for the module. It uses the `SC_THREAD` macro to declare `print_table` as a thread process.
4. **Process Declaration**: `void print_table()` is a member function of the module that contains the logic for printing the multiplication table.
5. **Loop and Print**: The loop and print statement inside `print_table` are identical to those in the C++ code, iterating from 1 to 10 and printing the multiplication results.
6. **Stop Simulation**: `sc_stop();` stops the simulation after the multiplication table has been printed.
7. **Main Function**: `int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[])` is the entry point for SystemC simulations. It creates an instance of `MultiplicationTable` and starts the simulation with `sc_start()`.

This SystemC code mirrors the logic of the original C++ code while fitting within the SystemC framework, making it suitable for simulation environments.
