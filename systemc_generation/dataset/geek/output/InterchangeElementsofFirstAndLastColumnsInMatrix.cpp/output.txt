### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: A 4x4 integer matrix `m` with predefined values.
- **Outputs**: The modified matrix where the elements of the first row have been swapped with the elements of the last row.

#### Line-by-Line Explanation

```cpp
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
```
- These lines include the standard input-output stream library and bring all its contents into the global namespace.

```cpp
#define n 4 
```
- This preprocessor directive defines a constant `n` with a value of 4, representing the size of the square matrix.

```cpp
void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n]) 
{ 
```
- This line declares a function named `interchangeFirstLast` that takes a 2D array `m` with dimensions `[n][n]`.

```cpp
    int rows = n; 
```
- Inside the function, an integer variable `rows` is declared and initialized to the value of `n`, which is 4.

```cpp
    // Swapping of element between first 
    // and last rows 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
    { 
        int t = m[0][i]; 
        m[0][i] = m[rows - 1][i]; 
        m[rows - 1][i] = t; 
    } 
}
```
- A loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`. For each iteration, it swaps the element at position `(0, i)` (first row) with the element at position `(rows-1, i)` (last row). The temporary variable `t` is used to hold one of the values during the swap.

```cpp
// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
    // input in the array 
    int m[n][n] = {{8, 9, 7, 6}, 
                    {4, 7, 6, 5}, 
                    {3, 2, 1, 8}, 
                    {9, 9, 7, 7}}; 
```
- The `main` function initializes a 4x4 matrix `m` with the given values.

```cpp
    interchangeFirstLast(m); 
```
- The `interchangeFirstLast` function is called with `m` as the argument, which modifies the matrix by swapping the first and last rows.

```cpp
    // Printing the interchanged matrix 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
    { 
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) 
            cout << m[i][j] << " "; 
        cout << endl; 
    } 
}
```
- Nested loops iterate through each element of the matrix `m`. The outer loop iterates over rows, and the inner loop iterates over columns. Each element is printed followed by a space, and after printing all elements of a row, a newline character is printed.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that performs the same operation as the provided C++/C code:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixSwapper) {
    SC_CTOR(MatrixSwapper) {
        SC_THREAD(swap_and_print);
    }

    void swap_and_print() {
        const int n = 4;
        int m[n][n] = {{8, 9, 7, 6},
                       {4, 7, 6, 5},
                       {3, 2, 1, 8},
                       {9, 9, 7, 7}};
        
        // Swapping the first and last rows
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int t = m[0][i];
            m[0][i] = m[n - 1][i];
            m[n - 1][i] = t;
        }
        
        // Printing the modified matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                cout << m[i][j] << " ";
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    MatrixSwapper matrix_swapper("matrix_swapper");
    sc_start();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **SC_MODULE(MatrixSwapper)**: Declares a SystemC module named `MatrixSwapper`.
- **SC_CTOR(MatrixSwapper)**: Constructor of the module that schedules the `swap_and_print` method to run as a thread.
- **swap_and_print()**: This method contains the logic to swap the first and last rows of a 4x4 matrix and print the resulting matrix.
- **sc_main()**: Entry point of the SystemC simulation, creates an instance of `MatrixSwapper`, and starts the simulation with `sc_start()`.

This SystemC code mirrors the functionality of the original C++/C code, suitable for use in a high-level synthesis flow.
