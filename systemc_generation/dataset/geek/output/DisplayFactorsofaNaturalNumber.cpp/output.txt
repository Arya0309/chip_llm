### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Input**: The number for which divisors are to be found. In this specific case, it is hardcoded as `100`.
- **Output**: The divisors of the number `100` are printed to the console.

#### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Include Directives**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream> 
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - These lines include the standard input-output stream library and declare that we are using the standard namespace, allowing us to use `cout` without prefixing it with `std::`.

2. **Function Definition**
   ```cpp
   void printDivisors(int n)
   ```
   - This defines a function named `printDivisors` that takes an integer `n` as an argument. The function does not return any value (`void`).

3. **Loop Through Possible Divisors**
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
   ```
   - A `for` loop initializes `i` to `1` and continues to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by `1`.

4. **Check if `i` is a Divisor**
   ```cpp
   if (n % i == 0)
   ```
   - Inside the loop, an `if` statement checks whether `i` is a divisor of `n` by verifying if the remainder when `n` is divided by `i` is zero (`n % i == 0`).

5. **Print Divisor**
   ```cpp
   cout << " " << i;
   ```
   - If the condition is true, the current value of `i` is printed to the console, followed by a space.

6. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   ```
   - The `main` function serves as the entry point of the program. It returns an integer value upon completion.

7. **Invoke Function and Print Message**
   ```cpp
   cout << "The divisors of 100 are: ";
   printDivisors(100);
   ```
   - The `main` function prints a message indicating that the divisors of `100` are about to be listed. Then, it calls the `printDivisors` function with `100` as the argument.

8. **Return Statement**
   ```cpp
   return 0;
   ```
   - The `main` function returns `0`, indicating successful execution of the program.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is a SystemC version of the provided C++ code. This SystemC module will perform the same task of printing the divisors of a given number. For simplicity, the number is still hardcoded as `100`.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DivisorPrinter) {
    SC_CTOR(DivisorPrinter) {
        SC_THREAD(print_divisors);
    }

    void print_divisors() {
        int n = 100; // Number for which divisors are to be found
        sc_start(1, SC_NS); // Start simulation for a short duration
        cout << "The divisors of " << n << " are: ";
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                cout << " " << i;
            }
        }
        cout << endl;
        sc_stop(); // Stop the simulation
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    DivisorPrinter dp("DivisorPrinter");
    sc_start(); // Start the simulation
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation of SystemC Code

1. **Include SystemC Header**
   ```cpp
   #include <systemc.h>
   ```
   - This includes the SystemC header file necessary for writing SystemC modules.

2. **Module Declaration**
   ```cpp
   SC_MODULE(DivisorPrinter) {
   ```
   - Declares a SystemC module named `DivisorPrinter`.

3. **Constructor**
   ```cpp
   SC_CTOR(DivisorPrinter) {
       SC_THREAD(print_divisors);
   }
   ```
   - The constructor uses the `SC_CTOR` macro to define the constructor for the module. It registers the `print_divisors` method as a thread within the module.

4. **Thread Method**
   ```cpp
   void print_divisors() {
       int n = 100;
       sc_start(1, SC_NS);
       cout << "The divisors of " << n << " are: ";
       for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
           if (n % i == 0) {
               cout << " " << i;
           }
       }
       cout << endl;
       sc_stop();
   }
   ```
   - This method is executed as a thread. It initializes `n` to `100`, starts a short simulation time to ensure proper initialization, prints the divisors of `n` in the same manner as the C++ code, and then stops the simulation.

5. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
       DivisorPrinter dp("DivisorPrinter");
       sc_start();
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `sc_main` function is the entry point for SystemC simulations. It creates an instance of the `DivisorPrinter` module and starts the simulation.

This SystemC code mirrors the functionality of the original C++ code while fitting into the SystemC simulation framework.
