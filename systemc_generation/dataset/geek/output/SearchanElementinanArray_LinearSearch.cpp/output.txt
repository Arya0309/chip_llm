### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - A vector `v` containing integers `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11}`.
  - An integer `key` which is the value to be searched in the vector, set to `8`.
- **Outputs**:
  - The position of the `key` in the vector if found (1-based index).
  - A message indicating that the `key` was not found if it is not present in the vector.

#### Line-by-Line Explanation

```cpp
// C++ Program to implement linear search algorithm iteratively
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
```
- The program includes the standard C++ library and uses the standard namespace.

```cpp
int linearSearch(vector<int> v, int key) {
```
- Function `linearSearch` is defined which takes a vector of integers `v` and an integer `key` as parameters.

```cpp
    // We test all the elements of the vector v against the given key
    for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
```
- A `for` loop iterates over each element of the vector `v`. The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `v.size() - 1`.

```cpp
        // If the KEY IS FOUND
        if (v[i] == key) {
            return i;
        }
    }
```
- Inside the loop, each element of the vector is compared with the `key`. If a match is found, the function returns the current index `i`, which is the position of the `key` in the vector (0-based index).

```cpp
    // Return some value denoting KEY NOT FOUND
    return -1;
}
```
- If the loop completes without finding the `key`, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the `key` is not present in the vector.

```cpp
int main() {
    vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};
```
- In the `main` function, a vector `v` is initialized with the integers `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11}`.

```cpp
    // Value to search
    int key = 8;
```
- An integer `key` is set to `8`, which is the value to be searched in the vector.

```cpp
    // Searching the key in the vector v
    int i = linearSearch(v, key);
```
- The `linearSearch` function is called with `v` and `key` as arguments, and the result is stored in the integer `i`.

```cpp
    // Checking if element is found or not
    if (i != -1)
        cout << key << " Found at Position: " << i + 1;
    else
        cout << key << " NOT found.";
    return 0;
}
```
- The result `i` is checked. If it is not `-1`, it means the `key` was found, and the position (converted to 1-based index by adding 1) is printed. Otherwise, a message indicating that the `key` was not found is printed.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is the equivalent SystemC code snippet that implements the same linear search logic. This code is designed to be used in a high-level synthesis flow, where the `linearSearch` functionality is encapsulated within a SystemC module.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// User Defined Linear Search Module
SC_MODULE(LinearSearchModule) {
    // Input port for the key to search
    sc_in<int> key_in;

    // Output port for the result (position or -1 if not found)
    sc_out<int> result_out;

    // Internal vector to hold the data
    std::vector<int> v;

    // Process to perform linear search
    void performSearch() {
        int key = key_in.read();
        int result = -1;

        // Perform linear search
        for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
            if (v[i] == key) {
                result = i + 1; // Convert to 1-based index
                break;
            }
        }

        // Write the result to the output port
        result_out.write(result);
    }

    // Constructor to initialize the vector and register the process
    SC_CTOR(LinearSearchModule) : v({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11}) {
        SC_METHOD(performSearch);
        sensitive << key_in;
    }
};

// Testbench module to drive inputs and capture outputs
SC_MODULE(Testbench) {
    // Signal to connect with LinearSearchModule
    sc_signal<int> key_sig;
    sc_signal<int> result_sig;

    // Instance of LinearSearchModule
    LinearSearchModule searcher;

    // Process to drive inputs and print outputs
    void driveAndPrint() {
        // Initialize the key to search
        key_sig = 8;

        // Wait for one delta cycle to let the search process
        wait(1, SC_NS);

        // Print the result
        int result = result_sig.read();
        if (result != -1)
            cout << "Key " << key_sig.read() << " Found at Position: " << result << endl;
        else
            cout << "Key " << key_sig.read() << " NOT found." << endl;
    }

    // Constructor to register the process and connect signals
    SC_CTOR(Testbench) : searcher("searcher") {
        // Connecting signals to the searcher ports
        searcher.key_in(key_sig);
        searcher.result_out(result_sig);

        // Registering the driveAndPrint process
        SC_THREAD(driveAndPrint);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    Testbench tb("tb");
    sc_start(); // Start simulation
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **LinearSearchModule**: This module performs the linear search operation.
  - It has an input port `key_in` to receive the key to be searched.
  - It has an output port `result_out` to send the result (position or `-1` if not found).
  - The internal vector `v` holds the data to be searched.
  - The method `performSearch` reads the key, performs the linear search, and writes the result to `result_out`.
  - The constructor initializes the vector `v` and registers the `performSearch` method to be sensitive to changes in `key_in`.

- **Testbench**: This module drives the inputs and captures the outputs.
  - It has signals `key_sig` and `result_sig` to connect with the `LinearSearchModule`.
  - It creates an instance of `LinearSearchModule`.
  - The method `driveAndPrint` initializes the key, waits for the search to complete, and prints the result.
  - The constructor connects the signals to the module's ports and registers the `driveAndPrint` thread.

This SystemC code accurately replicates the behavior of the original C++/C linear search program, suitable for use in a high-level synthesis flow.
