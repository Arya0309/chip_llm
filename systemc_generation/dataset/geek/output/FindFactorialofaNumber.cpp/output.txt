### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The program does not take any external input from the user or environment. Instead, it uses a hardcoded value `num` which is set to 5.
- **Outputs**: The program outputs the factorial of the number `num` to the console. In this case, it will output "Factorial of 5 is 120".

#### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Include Directives and Namespace**:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - These lines include the standard input-output stream library and bring all its components into the global namespace.

2. **Function Declaration and Definition**:
   ```cpp
   unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)
   {
       int res = 1, i;
       for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)
           res *= i;
       return res;
   }
   ```
   - This function calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`.
   - `res` is initialized to 1, which is the identity element for multiplication.
   - A `for` loop iterates from 2 to `n`, multiplying `res` by each integer in this range.
   - The final result, stored in `res`, is returned as the factorial of `n`.

3. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int num = 5;
       cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is "
            << factorial(num) << endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function initializes an integer `num` to 5.
   - It then calls the `factorial` function with `num` as the argument and prints the result to the console.
   - The program returns 0, indicating successful execution.

### Equivalent SystemC Code Snippet

Below is a SystemC code snippet that performs the same task as the provided C++ code. This SystemC code includes a module that calculates the factorial and a testbench to drive inputs and capture outputs.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Factorial Calculation Module
SC_MODULE(FactorialCalculator) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> input;    // Input port for the number to calculate factorial
    sc_out<unsigned int> output;  // Output port for the factorial result

    // Process to calculate factorial
    void calculateFactorial() {
        unsigned int n = input.read();
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        output.write(res);
    }

    // Constructor to register the process
    SC_CTOR(FactorialCalculator) {
        SC_METHOD(calculateFactorial);
        sensitive << input;
    }
};

// Testbench module to drive inputs and capture outputs
SC_MODULE(Testbench) {
    sc_signal<unsigned int> num;  // Signal for the number input
    sc_signal<unsigned int> fact; // Signal for the factorial output

    // Instance of FactorialCalculator
    FactorialCalculator calc;

    // Process to drive inputs and print outputs
    void driveAndPrint() {
        num = 5; // Set the number to 5
        wait(1, SC_NS); // Wait for one delta cycle to let the calculator process

        // Print the results
        cout << "Factorial of " << num.read() << " is " << fact.read() << endl;
    }

    // Constructor to register the process
    SC_CTOR(Testbench) : calc("calc") {
        // Connecting signals to the calculator ports
        calc.input(num);
        calc.output(fact);

        // Registering the driveAndPrint process
        SC_THREAD(driveAndPrint);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    Testbench tb("tb");
    sc_start(); // Start simulation
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of SystemC Code

- **FactorialCalculator Module**:
  - Contains two ports: `input` for receiving the number whose factorial is to be calculated, and `output` for sending the result.
  - The `calculateFactorial` method reads the input, computes the factorial using a loop, and writes the result to the output port.
  - The method is registered as a SystemC method sensitive to changes on the `input` port.

- **Testbench Module**:
  - Contains two signals: `num` for driving the input to the calculator and `fact` for capturing the output.
  - An instance of `FactorialCalculator` named `calc` is created.
  - The `driveAndPrint` thread sets the input to 5, waits for the calculator to process, and then prints the factorial result.
  - The thread is registered as a SystemC thread.

This SystemC code accurately mirrors the logic of the original C++ code while adhering to the SystemC framework's structure and processes.
