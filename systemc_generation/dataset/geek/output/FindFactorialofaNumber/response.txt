### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: The input to the program is a single unsigned integer `n` for which the factorial is calculated. In this specific case, `num` is set to 5.
- **Outputs**: The output is the factorial of the input number, which is printed to the console.

### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation
1. **`#include <iostream>`**: This includes the standard input-output stream library, allowing the program to use `cout` for printing to the console.
2. **`using namespace std;`**: This statement allows the use of standard library objects and functions without prefixing them with `std::`.
3. **`unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)`**: This is the declaration of a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as input and returns an unsigned integer.
4. **`int res = 1, i;`**: Inside the `factorial` function, two variables are declared: `res` initialized to 1 (to hold the result of the factorial), and `i` (used as a loop counter).
5. **`for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)`**: A `for` loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n`. It multiplies `res` by `i` in each iteration, effectively calculating the factorial.
6. **`res *= i;`**: This line multiplies `res` by `i` in each iteration of the loop.
7. **`return res;`**: After the loop completes, the function returns the computed factorial value stored in `res`.
8. **`int main()`**: The entry point of the program.
9. **`int num = 5;`**: An integer variable `num` is declared and initialized to 5, which is the number whose factorial will be calculated.
10. **`cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;`**: This line prints the factorial of `num` to the console using the `factorial` function.
11. **`return 0;`**: The `main` function returns 0, indicating successful execution.

### SystemC Equivalent Code
Below is the SystemC equivalent code that calculates the factorial of a number using the provided `in` and `out` signals for integration with an existing testbench.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates the factorial of a number
SC_MODULE(FactorialCalculator) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;  // Input port for the number
    sc_out<unsigned int> out; // Output port for the factorial result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(FactorialCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate factorial
        SC_METHOD(calculate_factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    // Method to calculate the factorial
    void calculate_factorial() {
        unsigned int n = in.read();
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }
};

```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code
- **`SC_MODULE(FactorialCalculator)`**: Declares a new SystemC module named `FactorialCalculator`.
- **`sc_in<unsigned int> in;`**: Declares an input port `in` of type `unsigned int` to receive the number for which the factorial is to be calculated.
- **`sc_out<unsigned int> out;`**: Declares an output port `out` of type `unsigned int` to send the calculated factorial result.
- **`SC_CTOR(FactorialCalculator)`**: Constructor for the `FactorialCalculator` module. It registers the `calculate_factorial` method to be triggered whenever the input changes.
- **`SC_METHOD(calculate_factorial);`**: Registers the `calculate_factorial` method as a SystemC method.
- **`sensitive << in;`**: Specifies that the `calculate_factorial` method should be executed whenever the value at the `in` port changes.
- **`void calculate_factorial()`**: This method reads the input value, calculates its factorial using a loop, and writes the result to the output port.
- **`unsigned int n = in.read();`**: Reads the input value from the `in` port.
- **`unsigned int res = 1;`**: Initializes the result variable `res` to 1.
- **`for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; i++)`**: Loop from 2 to `n` to calculate the factorial.
- **`res *= i;`**: Multiplies `res` by `i` in each iteration.
- **`out.write(res);`**: Writes the final factorial result to the `out` port.

This SystemC code can be integrated into a larger SystemC simulation environment or used in a high-level synthesis flow to compute the factorial of a number as specified by the input signal.
