### Analysis of the Provided C++/C Code

#### Inputs and Outputs
- **Input**: An integer `n` which is the decimal number to be converted to an octal number.
- **Output**: The octal representation of the input decimal number, printed to the console.

#### Detailed Line-by-Line/Block-by-Block Explanation

1. **Include Directives**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - Includes the standard input-output stream library and uses the standard namespace to avoid prefixing `std::` before standard library entities.

2. **Function Definition**
   ```cpp
   void decToOctal(int n)
   ```
   - Defines a function `decToOctal` that takes an integer `n` as an argument and converts it to its octal representation.

3. **Array Declaration**
   ```cpp
   int octalNum[100];
   ```
   - Declares an integer array `octalNum` of size 100 to store the digits of the octal number.

4. **Counter Initialization**
   ```cpp
   int i = 0;
   ```
   - Initializes a counter `i` to zero, which will be used as an index for storing the octal digits in the `octalNum` array.

5. **While Loop for Conversion**
   ```cpp
   while (n != 0) {
       octalNum[i] = n % 8;
       n = n / 8;
       i++;
   }
   ```
   - A loop that continues until `n` becomes zero. In each iteration:
     - It calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 8 (`n % 8`), which gives the next least significant digit of the octal number.
     - This digit is stored in the `octalNum` array at the position indexed by `i`.
     - `n` is then updated to be the quotient of `n` divided by 8 (`n / 8`), effectively removing the least significant digit.
     - The counter `i` is incremented to point to the next position in the array.

6. **Printing the Octal Number**
   ```cpp
   for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
       cout << octalNum[j];
   ```
   - A for loop that iterates from the last stored index `i-1` down to `0`, printing each element of the `octalNum` array. This loop ensures that the octal digits are printed in the correct order.

7. **Main Function**
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
       int n = 33;
       decToOctal(n);
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - The main function initializes an integer `n` with the value `33` and calls the `decToOctal` function to convert this number to its octal form. The result is printed to the console.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

Below is a SystemC code snippet that performs the same decimal-to-octal conversion. This code is designed to be used in a high-level synthesis flow, where the conversion logic is encapsulated within a SystemC module.

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to convert decimal to octal
SC_MODULE(DecToOctalConverter) {
    // Input port for decimal number
    sc_in<int> decimalIn;

    // Output port for octal number (as a string for simplicity)
    sc_out<sc_bv<32>> octalOut;

    // Process to perform the conversion
    void convert() {
        int n = decimalIn.read();
        sc_bv<32> octalNum; // Assuming a maximum of 32 bits for the octal representation
        int i = 0;

        // Conversion logic
        while (n != 0) {
            octalNum.range((i+1)*3-1, i*3) = n % 8; // Store each octal digit in 3-bit chunks
            n = n / 8;
            i++;
        }

        // Shift the octal digits to the left to align them properly
        octalNum <<= (32 - i*3);

        // Write the result to the output port
        octalOut.write(octalNum);
    }

    // Constructor to register the process
    SC_CTOR(DecToOctalConverter) {
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << decimalIn;
    }
};

// Testbench module to drive inputs and capture outputs
SC_MODULE(Testbench) {
    // Signals to connect with DecToOctalConverter
    sc_signal<int> decimalSignal;
    sc_signal<sc_bv<32>> octalSignal;

    // Instance of DecToOctalConverter
    DecToOctalConverter converter;

    // Process to drive inputs and print outputs
    void driveAndPrint() {
        // Initialize the decimal number
        decimalSignal = 33;

        // Wait for one delta cycle to let the converter process
        wait(1, SC_NS);

        // Print the results
        cout << "Decimal number: " << decimalSignal.read() << endl;
        cout << "Octal number: " << octalSignal.read().to_uint() << endl;
    }

    // Constructor to register the process
    SC_CTOR(Testbench) : converter("converter") {
        // Connecting signals to the converter ports
        converter.decimalIn(decimalSignal);
        converter.octalOut(octalSignal);

        // Registering the driveAndPrint process
        SC_THREAD(driveAndPrint);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    Testbench tb("tb");
    sc_start(); // Start simulation
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the SystemC Code

- **Module Definition**:
  - `DecToOctalConverter`: This module takes an integer input and converts it to an octal number, which is output as a 32-bit binary vector (`sc_bv<32>`). Each octal digit is stored in a 3-bit chunk within this vector.

- **Process**:
  - `convert()`: This method reads the decimal number, performs the conversion to octal, and writes the result to the output port. The octal digits are stored in a 32-bit vector, with each digit occupying 3 bits.

- **Testbench**:
  - `Testbench`: This module initializes the input signal, waits for the conversion to complete, and prints both the input decimal number and the resulting octal number.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code, making it suitable for use in a high-level synthesis flow.
