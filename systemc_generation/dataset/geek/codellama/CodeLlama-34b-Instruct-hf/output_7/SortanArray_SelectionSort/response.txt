  **Inputs:**

* `arr`: an array of integers to be sorted
* `n`: the size of the array

**Outputs:**

* `arr`: the sorted array

**Explanation:**

The code starts by defining two functions: `swap` and `selectionSort`. The `swap` function takes two integers as arguments and swaps their values. The `selectionSort` function takes an array of integers and its size as arguments, and sorts the array using the selection sort algorithm.

The `main` function is the entry point of the program, and it first defines an array of integers to be sorted, and its size. It then calls the `selectionSort` function to sort the array, and finally prints the sorted array.

The `selectionSort` function first initializes some variables: `i` and `j` to 0, `min_idx` to 0. It then iterates over the array, starting from the first element, and swaps the current element with the minimum element found in the remaining unsorted portion of the array. It does this by first finding the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array, and then swapping it with the current element. The loop repeats until the entire array is sorted.

The `swap` function swaps the values of two integers.

**SystemC Code:**
```[c]  
#include <systemc.h> 
 
SC_MODULE(SelectionSort) { 
  sc_in<int> arr[]; 
  sc_in<int> n; 
  sc_out<int> sorted_arr[]; 
  
  void sort() { 
    sorted_arr[0] = arr[0]; 
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) { 
      sorted_arr[i] = arr[i]; 
      for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) { 
        if (arr[j] < arr[i]) { 
          sorted_arr[i] = arr[j]; 
          arr[j] = arr[i]; 
          break; 
        } 
      } 
    } 
  } 
}; 
 
SC_MODULE(Testbench) { 
  sc_in<bool> clk; 
  sc_out<bool> start; 
  sc_in<bool> done; 
  
  SelectionSort sort; 
  
  void run() { 
    int arr[5] = {12, 25, 11, 22, 64}; 
    sort.arr = arr; 
    sort.n = 5; 
    sort.sorted_arr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * 5); 
    sort.sort(); 
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { 
      cout << sort.sorted_arr[i] << " "; 
    } 
    cout << endl; 
  } 
}; 

int sc_main(int argc, char *argv[]) { 
  Testbench tb; 
  sc_start(); 
  return 0; 
} 
```
In the above SystemC code, we have defined two modules: `SelectionSort` and `Testbench`. The `SelectionSort` module takes in an array of integers, its size, and provides a sorted array as output. The `Testbench` module provides the necessary signals for the `SelectionSort` module to work, and it simulates the behavior of the `SelectionSort` module using the `main` function.

In the `SelectionSort` module, we first initialize the output array `sorted_arr` to have the same size as the input array `arr`. We then iterate over the input array, and for each element, we find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted portion of the array, and swap it with the current element. We repeat this process until the entire array is sorted.

In the `Testbench` module, we first define a testbench for the `SelectionSort` module. We create an array of integers, set its size to 5, and pass it to the `SelectionSort` module. We then call the `sort` function of the `SelectionSort` module, and print the sorted array.
