  **Inputs:**

* `a`: an integer representing the first number to be swapped.
* `b`: an integer representing the second number to be swapped.

**Outputs:**

* `out_a`: an integer representing the new value of `a` after the swapping operation.
* `out_b`: an integer representing the new value of `b` after the swapping operation.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code defines a program that takes two integer inputs `a` and `b` and swaps them using a third variable `temp`. The program first prints the original values of `a` and `b` to the console, then applies the swapping algorithm, and finally prints the swapped values of `a` and `b` to the console.

Here is a line-by-line explanation of the code:

1. `int a = 2, b = 3;`: These lines declare two integer variables `a` and `b` and initialize them with the values 2 and 3, respectively.
2. `cout << "Before swapping a = " << a << " , b = " << b << endl;`: This line prints the string "Before swapping a = " to the console, followed by the value of `a`, a space, the value of `b`, and a newline.
3. `int temp;`: This line declares a third integer variable `temp`.
4. `temp = a;`: This line assigns the value of `a` to `temp`.
5. `a = b;`: This line assigns the value of `b` to `a`.
6. `b = temp;`: This line assigns the value of `temp` to `b`.
7. `cout << "After swapping a = " << a << " , b = " << b << endl;`: This line prints the string "After swapping a = " to the console, followed by the value of `a`, a space, the value of `b`, and a newline.
8. `return 0;`: This line returns the value 0, indicating that the program executed successfully.

**SystemC Code:**

The following is a SystemC code snippet that reflects the same behavior as the C++/C code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Swapper) {
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;
    sc_out<int> out_a;
    sc_out<int> out_b;

    void swap() {
        int temp;
        temp = a.read();
        a.write(b.read());
        b.write(temp);
    }

    sc_default_clk clk {
        swap();
    }
};
```
In this code, we define a SystemC module called `Swapper` that takes two input ports `a` and `b` and two output ports `out_a` and `out_b`. The `swap()` method takes the values of `a` and `b`, swaps them, and writes the swapped values to `out_a` and `out_b`, respectively. The `swap()` method is called every time the clock signal rises, which is defined in the `sc_default_clk` block.
