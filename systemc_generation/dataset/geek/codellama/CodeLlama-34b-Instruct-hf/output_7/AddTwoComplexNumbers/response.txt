  **Inputs:**

* `real1`: Real part of the first complex number.
* `imag1`: Imaginary part of the first complex number.
* `real2`: Real part of the second complex number.
* `imag2`: Imaginary part of the second complex number.

**Outputs:**

* `real_sum`: Real part of the sum of the two complex numbers.
* `imag_sum`: Imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers.

**Summary:**
The C++/C code provided is a simple program that defines a complex number class with real and imaginary parts, and provides a method for adding two complex numbers. The program declares four input signals `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`, which are the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers to be added. The program also declares two output signals `real_sum` and `imag_sum`, which are the real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers.

The program defines a constructor for the `Complex` class that initializes the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. The program also defines a method `addComp()` that takes two `Complex` objects as input and returns a new `Complex` object that represents the sum of the two input complex numbers. The `addComp()` method adds the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers separately and returns the sum as a new `Complex` object.

The program creates two `Complex` objects, `C1` and `C2`, and initializes their real and imaginary parts to `3` and `2`, and `9` and `5`, respectively. The program then calls the `addComp()` method to add `C1` and `C2` and stores the result in a new `C3` object. Finally, the program prints the real and imaginary parts of the sum (`C3`) on the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```c++
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1; // Input real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1; // Input imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2; // Input real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2; // Input imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum; // Output real part of the sum of the two complex numbers
    sc_out<int> imag_sum; // Output imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code above, we have defined a module called `ComplexAdder` that takes four input signals `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers to be added. The module also has two output signals `real_sum` and `imag_sum`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers.

The module defines a constructor that initializes the input and output signals and sets up the sensitivity list for the `add()` method.

The `add()` method adds the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers separately and writes the results to the output signals. Whenever any of the input signals change, the `add()` method is triggered, and the sum of the two complex numbers is calculated and written to the output signals.

Note that the SystemC code incorporates the signals defined above and captures the same logic as the C++/C code.
