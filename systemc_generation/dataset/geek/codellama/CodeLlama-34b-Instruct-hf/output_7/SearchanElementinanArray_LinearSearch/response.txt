  **Inputs**:

* `key`: The value that the function searches for in the vector
* `v`: The vector that the function searches for the value in

**Outputs**:

* `index`: The index of the first occurrence of the value in the vector, or -1 if the value is not found

**Summary**:

The code snippet implements a simple linear search algorithm that iterates through the vector `v` and compares each element with the `key`. If a match is found, the index of the element is returned, otherwise, -1 is returned.

**SystemC Code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LinearSearch) {
    sc_in<int> key; // Input port for the key
    sc_in< sc_vector<int> > data; // Input port for the vector
    sc_out<int> index; // Output port for the index

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LinearSearch) {
        // Process to perform linear search
        SC_METHOD(search);
        sensitive << key << data;
    }

    // Method to perform linear search
    void search() {
        // Initialize the index to -1
        index.write(-1);

        // Iterate through the vector
        for (int i = 0; i < data.size(); i++) {
            // If a match is found, return the index
            if (data[i] == key.read()) {
                index.write(i);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `LinearSearch` that has three ports: `key`, `data`, and `index`. The `key` port is an input port that takes in the search value, `data` is an input port that takes in the vector to search, and `index` is an output port that returns the index of the first occurrence of the search value in the vector.

The `search` method is a process that is triggered whenever `key` or `data` changes. It initializes the `index` to -1 and then iterates through the vector using a for loop. If a match is found, the `index` is set to the matching index and the process exits. If no match is found, the `index` is left at -1.

The `search` method is sensitive to both `key` and `data` inputs, meaning that it will re-execute whenever either of these inputs changes. This ensures that the function will return the correct result even if the input vector or search value changes.
