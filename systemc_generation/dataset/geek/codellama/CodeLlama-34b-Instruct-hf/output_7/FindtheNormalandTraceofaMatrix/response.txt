  **Inputs**:

* An integer matrix (mat) with dimensions `MAX x MAX` (default 100).
* A natural number (n) indicating the size of the matrix.

**Outputs**:

* The trace of the matrix (sum of the elements on the main diagonal).
* The normal of the matrix (square root of the sum of the squares of all elements).

**Code Summary**:

The code is a C++ program that computes the trace and normal of a square matrix of integers. The program has three functions: `findTrace`, `findNormal`, and `main`.

`findTrace` takes an integer matrix `mat[][MAX]` and a natural number `n` as input. It calculates the trace of the matrix by iterating over the main diagonal and summing the elements. The trace is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal.

`findNormal` takes an integer matrix `mat[][MAX]` and a natural number `n` as input. It calculates the normal of the matrix by iterating over all elements and summing their squares. The normal is the square root of the sum of the squares of all elements.

`main` creates a sample matrix `mat` of size 5x5 and assigns random values to it. It then calls `findTrace` and `findNormal` with `mat` and the size of the matrix (5) as input. Finally, it prints the trace and normal of the matrix to the console.

**SystemC Code**:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that computes the trace and normal of a matrix
SC_MODULE(MatOP) {
    // Input port for the matrix
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];
    // Output port for the trace
    sc_out<int> trace;
    // Output port for the normal
    sc_out<int> norm;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatOP) {
        // Process to compute the trace
        SC_METHOD(findTrace);
        sensitive << matrix;
        // Process to compute the normal
        SC_METHOD(findNormal);
        sensitive << matrix;
    }

    // Method to compute the trace
    void findTrace() {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                if (i == j) {
                    sum += matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        trace.write(sum);
    }

    // Method to compute the normal
    void findNormal() {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                sum += matrix[i][j] * matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        norm.write(sqrt(sum));
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we define a module `MatOP` with input port `matrix`, output ports `trace`, and `norm`. We also have two processes `findTrace` and `findNormal` that compute the trace and normal of the matrix, respectively. The `findTrace` process iterates over the main diagonal of the matrix, sums the elements, and writes the result to the `trace` output port. The `findNormal` process iterates over all elements of the matrix, squares the values, sums them, and takes the square root of the result, which is the normal of the matrix.

Note that we have used the `SIMPLE` data type for the `matrix` input port, which is a 2D array of `int`s. We have also used the `OUTPUT` data type for the `trace` and `norm` output ports. The `findTrace` and `findNormal` methods have been defined as `SC_METHOD`s, which are processes that are automatically triggered whenever the input port is updated.
