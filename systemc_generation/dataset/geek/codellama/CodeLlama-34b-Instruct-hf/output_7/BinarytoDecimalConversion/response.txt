  **Inputs:**

* `num`: A binary number represented as an integer.

**Outputs:**

* `dec_value`: The decimal representation of the binary number.

**Line-by-line explanation:**

1. The first line is an include statement that imports the `iostream` header, which provides functions for input and output operations.
2. The second line is a using statement that imports the `std` namespace, which contains various functions and variables for standard input and output operations.
3. The third line is a function prototype for a function called `binaryToDecimal` that takes an integer argument and returns an integer value.
4. The function `binaryToDecimal` takes an integer argument `n` and declares two local variables, `num`, which is equal to `n`, and `dec_value`, which is initialized to 0.
5. The function then declares a local variable `base`, which is initialized to 1, which represents the base value for the binary number.
6. The function then declares a local variable `temp`, which is initialized to the value of `num`.
7. The function then enters a loop that continues as long as `temp` is non-zero.
8. Inside the loop, the function extracts the last digit of `temp` by taking the remainder of `temp` divided by 10, and stores it in the variable `last_digit`.
9. The function then divides `temp` by 10, and stores the result back into `temp`.
10. The function then multiplies `last_digit` by `base`, and adds the result to `dec_value`.
11. The function then multiplies `base` by 2, and updates the value of `base`.
12. The loop continues until `temp` is zero.
13. The function then returns `dec_value`, which represents the decimal representation of the binary number.
14. The main function takes no arguments, and declares a local variable `num`, which is initialized to 10101001.
15. The function then prints the result of calling `binaryToDecimal` with `num` as an argument, followed by a newline character.

**SystemC code:**
```
// Signal definitions
sc_in<int> binary_in;
sc_out<int> decimal_out;

// Module definition
SC_MODULE(BinaryToDecimal) {
    // Input port for binary number
    sc_in<int> binary_in;

    // Output port for decimal number
    sc_out<int> decimal_out;

    // State variable for base
    int base;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinaryToDecimal) {
        // Initialize state variable for base
        base = 1;
    }

    // Function to convert binary to decimal
    void binaryToDecimal() {
        int num = binary_in.read();
        int dec_value = 0;

        int temp = num;
        while (temp) {
            int last_digit = temp % 10;
            temp = temp / 10;
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base = base * 2;
        }

        decimal_out.write(dec_value);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define two signals: `binary_in` and `decimal_out`, which are the inputs and outputs of the module, respectively. We also define a state variable `base` to keep track of the base value for the binary number.

We then define a constructor for the module that initializes the state variable `base` to 1.

The `binaryToDecimal` function takes no arguments and performs the conversion from binary to decimal. It first reads the input binary number from the signal `binary_in`. It then initializes a local variable `dec_value` to 0, and a local variable `temp` to the value of `num`.

The function then enters a loop that continues as long as `temp` is non-zero. Inside the loop, it extracts the last digit of `temp` by taking the remainder of `temp` divided by 10, and stores it in the variable `last_digit`. It then divides `temp` by 10, and stores the result back into `temp`.

The function then multiplies `last_digit` by `base`, and adds the result to `dec_value`. It then multiplies `base` by 2, and updates the value of `base`. The loop continues until `temp` is zero.

Finally, the function writes the resulting decimal value to the output signal `decimal_out`.
