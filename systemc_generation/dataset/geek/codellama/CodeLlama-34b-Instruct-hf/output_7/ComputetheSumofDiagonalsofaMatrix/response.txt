  **Inputs:**

1. matrix: A 2D array of integers, representing a square matrix.
2. n: An integer, representing the size of the square matrix.

**Outputs:**

1. principal: An integer, representing the sum of the elements along the principal diagonal of the matrix.
2. secondary: An integer, representing the sum of the elements along the secondary diagonal of the matrix.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code defines a function called `printDiagonalSums` that takes two arguments: a square matrix `mat` of size `n` and an integer `n`. The function calculates and prints the sum of the elements along the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix.

Here's a line-by-line breakdown of the code:

1. `void printDiagonalSums(int mat[][MAX], int n)`: The function signature defines the input arguments: a 2D array `mat` of size `n` and an integer `n`.
2. `int principal = 0, secondary = 0;` : The function declares two local variables: `principal` and `secondary` and initializes them to 0. These variables will store the sums of the elements along the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix, respectively.
3. `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` : The first loop iterates over the rows of the matrix. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches the number of rows, which is `n-1`.
4. `for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)` : The second loop iterates over the columns of the matrix. The loop variable `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches the number of columns, which is also `n-1`.
5. `if (i == j)` : This condition is true when the row index `i` is equal to the column index `j`. This means we are on the principal diagonal of the matrix.
6. `principal += mat[i][j]` : When we are on the principal diagonal, we add the element at the current position `mat[i][j]` to the `principal` sum.
7. `if ((i + j) == (n - 1))` : This condition is true when the sum of the row index `i` and column index `j` is equal to `n-1`. This means we are on the secondary diagonal of the matrix.
8. `secondary += mat[i][j]` : When we are on the secondary diagonal, we add the element at the current position `mat[i][j]` to the `secondary` sum.
9. `cout << "Principal Diagonal:" << principal << endl;`: The function prints the `principal` sum along the principal diagonal.
10. `cout << "Secondary Diagonal:" << secondary << endl;`: The function prints the `secondary` sum along the secondary diagonal.

**SystemC Code:**

Here's a compilable SystemC code snippet that demonstrates the same logic as the C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSums) {
    // Inputs
    SC_IN<int> mat[MAX][MAX];
    SC_IN<int> n;
    // Outputs
    SC_OUT<int> principal;
    SC_OUT<int> secondary;

    void computeSums() {
        // Initialize the sums
        int principal = 0, secondary = 0;
        // Loop over the rows and columns of the matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // Check if we are on the principal diagonal
                if (i == j) {
                    // Add the element to the principal sum
                    principal += mat[i][j];
                }
                // Check if we are on the secondary diagonal
                else if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) {
                    // Add the element to the secondary sum
                    secondary += mat[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        // Write the sums to the output signals
        principal.write(principal);
        secondary.write(secondary);
    }

    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSums) {
        // Register the computeSums method as a process
        SC_METHOD(computeSums);
        // Sensitive to changes in the input signals
        sensitive << mat << n;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `DiagonalSums` that takes in two input signals: `mat` and `n`. The module has two output signals: `principal` and `secondary`. The `computeSums` method calculates the sums along the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix and writes the results to the output signals. The `SC_METHOD` macro is used to register the `computeSums` method as a process that will be triggered when the input signals change.
