  **Inputs:**

* `octal_input`: An integer representing an octal number

**Outputs:**

* `decimal_output`: An integer representing the decimal equivalent of the input octal number

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code is a function that converts an octal number to its decimal equivalent. The function takes an octal number as an integer input and returns the decimal equivalent as an integer output.

The function starts by declaring two variables: `num`, which is set to the input octal number, and `dec_value`, which is set to 0. It then declares three more variables: `base`, which is set to 1 (representing 8^0), `temp`, which is set to `num`, and `last_digit`, which is set to 0.

The function then enters a `while` loop that runs until `temp` is equal to 0. In each iteration of the loop, the function extracts the last digit of `temp` by using the modulo operator (`temp % 10`). It then divides `temp` by 10 and stores the result in `temp`. The function then multiplies the last digit by the current `base` value and adds it to `dec_value`. Finally, it multiplies `base` by 8 and updates it.

After the `while` loop exits, the function returns `dec_value` as the decimal equivalent of the input octal number.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
SC_MODULE(OctalToDecimal) {
    sc_in<int> octal_input;
    sc_out<int> decimal_output;

    void octalToDecimal() {
        int num = octal_input.read();
        int dec_value = 0;
        int base = 1;
        int temp = num;

        while (temp) {
            int last_digit = temp % 10;
            temp = temp / 10;
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base = base * 8;
        }

        decimal_output.write(dec_value);
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we define a module `OctalToDecimal` that has two input ports: `octal_input` and `decimal_output`. The `octalToDecimal` method is called whenever the `octal_input` port receives a new value. The method first retrieves the input value from `octal_input` and then calls the `OctalToDecimal` function from the previous code snippet to compute the decimal equivalent. The resulting decimal value is then written to the `decimal_output` port.

Note that in the SystemC code, we have changed the names of some of the variables to make them more descriptive and consistent with the SystemC naming conventions. We have also removed the `main` function since it is not needed in SystemC.
