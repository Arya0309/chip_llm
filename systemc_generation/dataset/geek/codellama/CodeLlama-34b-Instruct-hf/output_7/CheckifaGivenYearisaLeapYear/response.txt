  **Inputs**:

* `year`: An integer representing the year to be checked.

**Outputs**:

* `is_leap_year`: A boolean value indicating whether the given year is a leap year or not.

**Summary**:

The provided C++/C code is a function `checkYear` that takes an integer argument `year` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the year is a leap year or not. The function first checks if the year is divisible by 400, if it is, then it returns `true` indicating that the year is a leap year. If the year is not divisible by 400, then it checks if it is divisible by 100, if it is, then it returns `false` indicating that the year is not a leap year. If the year is not divisible by 100, then it checks if it is divisible by 4, if it is, then it returns `true` indicating that the year is a leap year. Otherwise, it returns `false` indicating that the year is not a leap year.

In the `main` function, the function `checkYear` is called with the input `year` and the output `is_leap_year` is printed indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.

**SystemC Code**:

To preserve the logic of the original C++/C code, the following SystemC code can be used:
```
// SystemC module that checks if a given year is a leap year or not
SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    sc_in<int> year; // Input port for the year to be checked
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year; // Output port indicating whether the year is a leap year or not

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
        // Process to check if the year is a leap year
        SC_METHOD(checkYear);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    // Method to check if the year is a leap year
    void checkYear() {
        if (year.read() % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year.read() % 100 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        } else if (year.read() % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```
In this code, the module `LeapYearChecker` takes an input `year` and an output `is_leap_year`. In the constructor of the module, the method `checkYear` is defined, which takes the input `year` and checks if it is a leap year or not. If it is, then `is_leap_year` is set to `true`, otherwise it is set to `false`. The method `checkYear` is sensitive to the input `year`, meaning that it will be automatically triggered whenever the input changes.
