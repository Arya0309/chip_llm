  **Inputs:**

* `n`: An integer value representing the Fibonacci number to be calculated.

**Outputs:**

* `result`: An integer value representing the calculated Fibonacci number.

**Summary:**
The provided C++/C code implements a program that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using loops. The `fib()` function takes an integer input `n` and returns the value of the nth Fibonacci number. The function uses two variables, `prev1` and `prev2`, to store the previous two values of the Fibonacci sequence, and a variable `curr` to store the current value. The function then calculates the next Fibonacci number by adding the previous two values and updating the previous two values.

The `main()` function takes an integer input `n` for the Fibonacci number to be calculated, and calls the `fib()` function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. The calculated Fibonacci number is then printed to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
Here is a SystemC code snippet that implements the same functionality as the provided C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates the Fibonacci sequence
SC_MODULE(Fibonacci) {
    sc_in<int> n; // Input port for the Fibonacci number to be calculated
    sc_out<int> result; // Output port for the calculated Fibonacci number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Fibonacci) {
        // Process to calculate the Fibonacci number
        SC_METHOD(fib);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to calculate the Fibonacci number
    void fib() {
        int prev1 = 1, prev2 = 0;
        int curr;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n.read(); i++) {
            curr = prev1 + prev2;
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = curr;
        }
        result.write(curr);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `Fibonacci` with two ports: `n` and `result`. The `n` port is an input port that takes the integer value of the Fibonacci number to be calculated. The `result` port is an output port that returns the calculated Fibonacci number.

The `Fibonacci` module has a single process, `fib`, that calculates the Fibonacci number using the same logic as the provided C++/C code. The process takes the input `n` from the `n` port and calculates the next Fibonacci number. The calculated Fibonacci number is then written to the `result` port.

The SystemC code uses the `sc_in` and `sc_out` types to represent the input and output ports, respectively. The `sensitive` keyword is used to specify that the `fib` process should be triggered whenever the `n` input port changes.
