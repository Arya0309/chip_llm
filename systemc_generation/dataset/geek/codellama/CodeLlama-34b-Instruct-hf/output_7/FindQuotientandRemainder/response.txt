  **Inputs:**

* `Dividend`: The number to be divided.
* `Divisor`: The number by which the dividend is divided.

**Outputs:**

* `Quotient`: The result of dividing the dividend by the divisor.
* `Remainder`: The leftover amount after dividing the dividend by the divisor.
* `Error`: A Boolean value indicating whether an error occurred during the division process (e.g., division by zero).

**Line by Line Explanation:**

* `using namespace std;`: This line tells the compiler to use the standard library namespace.
* `int Dividend, Quotient, Divisor, Remainder;`: These lines declare integer variables `Dividend`, `Quotient`, `Divisor`, and `Remainder`.
* `cout << "Enter Dividend & Divisor: ";`: This line outputs the string "Enter Dividend & Divisor: " to the command prompt.
* `cin >> Dividend >> Divisor;`: This line takes input from the user for `Dividend` and `Divisor` separated by a space.
* `if (Divisor == 0) {`: This line checks if the `Divisor` is equal to zero.
* `cout << "Error: Divisor cannot be zero." << endl;`: If the divisor is zero, this line outputs an error message to the command prompt.
* `else {`: If the divisor is not zero, the program proceeds to the next block of code.
* `Quotient = Dividend / Divisor;`: This line calculates the quotient of dividing `Dividend` by `Divisor`.
* `Remainder = Dividend % Divisor;`: This line calculates the remainder of dividing `Dividend` by `Divisor`.
* `cout << "The Quotient = " << Quotient << endl;`: This line outputs the quotient to the command prompt.
* `cout << "The Remainder = " << Remainder << endl;`: This line outputs the remainder to the command prompt.
* `return 0;`: This line returns 0 to the calling function to indicate that the program executed successfully.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Divider) {
  sc_in<int> dividend;  // Input port for the dividend
  sc_in<int> divisor;  // Input port for the divisor
  sc_out<int> quotient;  // Output port for the quotient
  sc_out<int> remainder;  // Output port for the remainder
  sc_out<bool> error;  // Output port for the error flag

  // Constructor
  SC_CTOR(Divider) {
    // Process to perform division
    SC_METHOD(divide);
    sensitive << dividend << divisor;
  }

  // Method to perform division
  void divide() {
    if (divisor.read() == 0) {
      error.write(true);
    } else {
      quotient.write(dividend.read() / divisor.read());
      remainder.write(dividend.read() % divisor.read());
    }
  }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we have defined a module `Divider` with input ports for the dividend and divisor, output ports for the quotient, remainder, and error flag. We have also defined a method `divide` that performs the division and writes the results to the output ports. The method checks for division by zero and sets the error flag accordingly. The `SC_METHOD` statement ensures that the method is only executed when the inputs change.
