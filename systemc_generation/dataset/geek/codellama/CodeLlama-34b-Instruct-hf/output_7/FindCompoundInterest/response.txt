  **Inputs**:

* principal: Initial amount of money
* rate: Interest rate expressed as a percentage of the principal
* time: Time in years

**Output**:
Compound interest earned over the specified time period

**Explanation**:
The C++/C code calculates compound interest for a given amount of money, interest rate, and time period. It first calculates the total amount (A) as principal \* (1 + interest rate / 100)^time. Then, it calculates the compound interest as the difference between the total amount and the principal. Finally, it prints the compound interest to the console.

Here's the equivalent SystemC code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CompoundInterest) {
    sc_in<double> principal;
    sc_in<double> rate;
    sc_in<double> time;
    sc_out<double> ci;

    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterest) {
        SC_METHOD(compute);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    void compute() {
        double A = principal * (pow(1 + rate / 100, time));
        ci.write(A - principal);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `CompoundInterest` with input ports for `principal`, `rate`, and `time`. The output port is `ci`. The SystemC code uses the same logic as the C++/C code to calculate compound interest and writes the result to the `ci` output port.

Note that we use the `sc_in` and `sc_out` ports to define the input and output ports, respectively. These ports are used to receive and write data to the SystemC module. The `SC_CTOR` macro is used to define a constructor for the module, which automatically calls the `SC_METHOD` macro to define a method. The `SC_METHOD` macro specifies the port sensitivity list, which defines which inputs to the method should trigger an update. In this case, we want the method to update whenever the values of `principal`, `rate`, or `time` change.
