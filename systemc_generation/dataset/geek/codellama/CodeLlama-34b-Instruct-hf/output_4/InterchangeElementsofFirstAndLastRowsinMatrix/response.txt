  **Inputs**:

* `m`: a two-dimensional array of integers, representing a matrix.
* `n`: the number of rows and columns in the matrix.

**Outputs**:

* The matrix `m` with the elements of the first and last columns interchanged.

**Explanation**:

The provided C++/C code defines a function `interchangeFirstLast` that takes a two-dimensional integer array `m` as input and swaps the elements of the first and last columns of the matrix. The function first declares two integer variables `t` and `n`, where `n` is the number of rows and columns in the matrix. Then, it uses a for-loop to iterate through each row of the matrix, swapping the elements at indices `(i, 0)` and `(i, n-1)` for each row `i`. Finally, the function prints the resulting interchanged matrix to the console.

Here is a line-by-line breakdown of the code:

1. `#include <iostream>`: Includes the input/output header file.
2. `using namespace std;`: Uses the standard namespace.
3. `#define n 4`: Defines a macro `n` to represent the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
4. `void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n])`: Declares a function `interchangeFirstLast` that takes an integer matrix `m` as input.
5. `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`: Starts a for-loop that iterates through each row of the matrix.
6. `int t = m[i][0];`: Declares an integer variable `t` and assigns it the value of the element at index `(i, 0)` of the matrix.
7. `m[i][0] = m[i][n - 1];`: Assigns the element at index `(i, n-1)` of the matrix to the element at index `(i, 0)`.
8. `m[i][n - 1] = t;`: Assigns the value of `t` to the element at index `(i, n-1)` of the matrix.
9. `cout << "Interchanged matrix:" << endl;`: Prints the message "Interchanged matrix:" to the console followed by a newline.
10. `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`: Starts a new for-loop that iterates through each row of the matrix.
11. `for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)`: Starts a nested for-loop that iterates through each column of the matrix.
12. `cout << m[i][j] << " ";`: Prints the element at index `(i, j)` of the matrix followed by a space.
13. `cout << endl;`: Prints a newline.
14. `return 0;`: Returns 0 to indicate that the program has ended successfully.

**SystemC Code**:

Here is a SystemC code snippet that incorporates the signals `in` and `out` and implements the same behavior as the provided C++/C code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(InterchangeFirstLast) {
    sc_in<int> in[SIZE]; // Input port for the matrix
    sc_out<int> out[SIZE]; // Output port for the interchanged matrix

    void interchangeFirstLast() {
        int t;
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            t = in[i][0];
            in[i][0] = in[i][SIZE - 1];
            in[i][SIZE - 1] = t;
        }
        out.write(in);
    }

    SC_CTOR(InterchangeFirstLast) {
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    InterchangeFirstLast interchangeFirstLast("interchangeFirstLast");

    // Input matrix
    int m[SIZE][SIZE] = {{8, 9, 7, 6},
                        {4, 7, 6, 5},
                        {3, 2, 1, 8},
                        {9, 9, 7, 7}};

    sc_start(10, SC_NS);

    // Interchange first and last columns of the matrix
    interchangeFirstLast.interchangeFirstLast();

    // Print the interchanged matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
            cout << interchangeFirstLast.out[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
In this code snippet, we define a SystemC module `InterchangeFirstLast` that has two ports: `in` and `out`. The `in` port is an array of `int` signals that represents the input matrix, and the `out` port is an array of `int` signals that represents the interchanged matrix.

The `interchangeFirstLast` function is implemented to take an integer matrix `m` as input and swap the elements of the first and last columns of the matrix. The function uses a for-loop to iterate through each row of the matrix and does the swapping. Finally, the function writes the resulting interchanged matrix to the `out` port using the `write` method.

In the `sc_main` function, we create an instance of the `InterchangeFirstLast` module and connect the `in` and `out` ports to the input and output arrays, respectively. We then call the `interchangeFirstLast` function to interchange the first and last columns of the matrix. Finally, we print the interchanged matrix to the console.
