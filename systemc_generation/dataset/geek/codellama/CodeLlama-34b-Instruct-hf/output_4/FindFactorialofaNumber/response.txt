  **Inputs**:

* `in`: The input value to the factorial function.
* `num`: The value to compute the factorial of.

**Outputs**:

* `out`: The factorial of the input value.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

* `using namespace std;` : This line allows us to use the standard C++ namespace, which includes functions like `cout`.
* `unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)` : The function `factorial` is declared with a single input parameter `n` of type `unsigned int`.
* `int res = 1, i;` : The variables `res` and `i` are declared and initialized to 1 and 0, respectively.
* `for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)` : This line defines a loop that will iterate from 2 to `n`.
* `res *= i;` : The result variable `res` is multiplied by the current value of `i`.
* `return res;` : The function returns the result variable `res`.
* `int num = 5;` : The variable `num` is declared and initialized to 5.
* `cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;` : The function `factorial` is called with `num` as the input and the result is printed to the console.
* `return 0;` : The `main` function returns 0 to indicate successful termination.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;
    sc_out<unsigned int> out;

    void factorial() {
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= in.read(); i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }

    SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
        SC_METHOD(factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    sc_clock clk("clk", 10, SC_NS, 0.5, 0, SC_NS, true);
    Factorial fact("fact");
    fact.in.write(5);
    sc_start(10, SC_NS);
    fact.factorial();
    cout << "Factorial of 5 is " << fact.out.read() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
**Note**: The SystemC code is designed to be integrated with our existing testbench, which includes the signals `in` and `out`. Additionally, the code uses the clock signal `clk` with a frequency of 10ns and a duty cycle of 50%.
