**Line-by-line explanation**:

1. `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`: Includes the standard C++ header files for various possible use cases.
2. `using namespace std;`: Uses the standard C++ namespace.
3. `class Complex { ... };`: Defines the `Complex` class to represent a complex number.
4. `public: int real, imaginary;`: Declares the real and imaginary parts of the complex number as public members.
5. `Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0) { ... }`: Defines the constructor for the `Complex` class, which initializes the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
6. `Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2) { ... }`: Defines the `addComp` method for the `Complex` class, which takes two `Complex` objects as input and returns their sum as a new `Complex` object.
7. `int main() { ... }`: Defines the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.
8. `// First Complex number`: Comment indicates the start of the code for the first complex number.
9. `Complex C1(3, 2);`: Creates a new `Complex` object with real part 3 and imaginary part 2.
10. `cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;`: Prints the first complex number to the console.
11. `// Second Complex number`: Comment indicates the start of the code for the second complex number.
12. `Complex C2(9, 5);`: Creates a new `Complex` object with real part 9 and imaginary part 5.
13. `cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;`: Prints the second complex number to the console.
14. `// For Storing the sum`: Comment indicates the start of the code for the sum of the two complex numbers.
15. `Complex C3;`: Creates a new `Complex` object to store the sum.
16. `// Calling addComp() method`: Comment indicates the start of the code for adding the two complex numbers using the `addComp` method.
17. `C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);`: Calls the `addComp` method with `C1` and `C2` as input and assigns the result to `C3`.
18. `cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary << endl;`: Prints the sum of the two complex numbers to the console.

**Equivalent SystemC code**:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) 
{
    // Input signals for the real and imaginary
    // parts of the two complex numbers
    sc_in<int> real1;
    sc_in<int> imag1;
    sc_in<int> real2;
    sc_in<int> imag2;

    // Output signal for the sum of the two complex numbers
    sc_out<int> real_sum;
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) 
    {
        // Process for adding the two complex numbers
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method for adding the two complex numbers
    void add() 
    {
        // Create temporary variables to store the real
        // and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers
        int temp_real1 = real1.read();
        int temp_imag1 = imag1.read();
        int temp_real2 = real2.read();
        int temp_imag2 = imag2.read();

        // Calculate the sum of the real and imaginary parts
        int sum_real = temp_real1 + temp_real2;
        int sum_imag = temp_imag1 + temp_imag2;

        // Assign the sum to the output signal
        real_sum.write(sum_real);
        imag_sum.write(sum_imag);
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, the `ComplexAdder` module has four input signals: `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers to be added. The `add` method takes these inputs and calculates the sum of the real and imaginary parts separately, then assigns the sum to the `real_sum` and `imag_sum` output signals.

Note that the SystemC code uses a different data type (`sc_int`) for the input and output signals compared to the original C++ code. This is because SystemC is a hardware description language that is designed to model digital hardware, while C++ is a general-purpose programming language. The `sc_int` data type in SystemC is a 32-bit signed integer, which is appropriate for modeling digital hardware.
