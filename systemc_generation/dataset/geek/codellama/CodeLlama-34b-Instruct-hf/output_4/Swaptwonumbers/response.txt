  **Inputs:**

* `a`: integer to be swapped with `b`
* `b`: integer to be swapped with `a`

**Outputs:**

* `out_a`: integer value of `a` after swapping
* `out_b`: integer value of `b` after swapping

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code is a simple program that swaps two integers using a third variable as a temporary storage. The code starts by defining the variables `a` and `b` and initializing them to 2 and 3, respectively. The program then creates a temporary variable `temp` and sets its value to `a`. The value of `b` is then assigned to `a`, and the value of `temp` is assigned to `b`.

The code then prints the values of `a` and `b` before and after the swapping using `std::cout`.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Swapper) {
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;
    sc_out<int> out_a;
    sc_out<int> out_b;

    SC_CTOR(Swapper) {
        SC_THREAD(swap);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    void swap() {
        int temp = a.read();
        a.write(b.read());
        b.write(temp);
    }
}
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `Swapper` that takes two input ports `a` and `b`, and two output ports `out_a` and `out_b`. The module has a single thread named `swap` that swaps the values of `a` and `b` using a temporary variable `temp`. The swapping is performed by first reading the value of `a` and storing it in `temp`, then reading the value of `b` and storing it in `a`, and finally reading the value of `temp` and storing it in `b`.

The `swap` thread is triggered when either `a` or `b` changes and is sensitive to the changes of both ports. This ensures that the swapping logic is executed every time the values of `a` and `b` are updated.

The module can be instantiated in a SystemC design and connected to the testbench signals `a`, `b`, `out_a`, and `out_b` to perform the swapping.
