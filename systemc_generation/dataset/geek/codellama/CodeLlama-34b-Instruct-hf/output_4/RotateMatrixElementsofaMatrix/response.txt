  **Inputs:**

* `int a[R][C]`: A two-dimensional array of integers that represents a matrix.
* `int R`: The number of rows in the matrix.
* `int C`: The number of columns in the matrix.

**Outputs:**

* `void`: The function does not return any value. Instead, it rotates the matrix and prints the rotated matrix to the console.

**Summary:**

The function `rotatematrix` takes a two-dimensional array of integers, `a`, and its dimensions, `R` and `C`, as input. It rotates the matrix by 90 degrees in a clockwise direction and prints the rotated matrix to the console.

The function first checks if the matrix is valid (i.e., if `R` and `C` are positive and non-zero) and if the matrix can be rotated (i.e., if `R` and `C` are equal). If the matrix is not valid or cannot be rotated, the function returns without doing anything.

The function then initializes several variables:

* `row`: The current row index.
* `col`: The current column index.
* `prev`: The previous element in the current row.
* `curr`: The current element in the current row.

The function then enters a while loop that iterates until the entire matrix has been rotated. The loop consists of three main parts:

1. **Move elements of first row from remaining rows**: In this part, the function moves the elements of the first row to the left by one position. The element that was previously in the first column is stored in `prev`, and the current element is stored in `curr`. The function then replaces the current element with `prev`, and `prev` with `curr`.
2. **Move elements of last column from remaining columns**: In this part, the function moves the elements of the last column up by one position. The element that was previously in the last row is stored in `prev`, and the current element is stored in `curr`. The function then replaces the current element with `prev`, and `prev` with `curr`.
3. **Move elements of last row from remaining rows**: In this part, the function moves the elements of the last row to the left by one position. The element that was previously in the first column is stored in `prev`, and the current element is stored in `curr`. The function then replaces the current element with `prev`, and `prev` with `curr`.

After the while loop is finished, the function prints the rotated matrix to the console.
