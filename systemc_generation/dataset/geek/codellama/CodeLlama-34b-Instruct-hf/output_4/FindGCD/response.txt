  **Inputs:**

* `a`: first number
* `b`: second number

**Outputs:**

* `gcd_result`: greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`

**Summary:**

The C++/C code finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using simple arithmetic. The function `gcd` takes two integer inputs and returns an integer output. The function first finds the minimum of `a` and `b`, and then tests the divisibility of all numbers from the minimum to 1. If any number divides both `a` and `b`, the function returns that number as the GCD.

The `main` function takes two integer inputs `a` and `b` and calls the `gcd` function to find the GCD of the two numbers. The result is then displayed using the `cout` statement.

**Equivalent SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Gcd) {
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;
    sc_out<int> gcd_result;
    
    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Gcd) {
        SC_METHOD(compute_gcd);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }
    
    // Method to compute the GCD
    void compute_gcd() {
        gcd_result.write(gcd(a.read(), b.read()));
    }
    
    // Function to find the GCD
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        int res = min(a, b);
        while (res > 1) {
            if (a % res == 0 && b % res == 0) {
                break;
            }
            res -= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined a module called `Gcd` that takes two integer input signals `a` and `b`, and an integer output signal `gcd_result`. The `compute_gcd` method is sensitive to changes in `a` and `b`, and when either of them changes, it calls the `gcd` function to compute the GCD of `a` and `b`. The function `gcd` takes two integer inputs and returns an integer output. The function first finds the minimum of `a` and `b`, and then tests the divisibility of all numbers from the minimum to 1. If any number divides both `a` and `b`, the function returns that number as the GCD.

The `gcd_result` signal is updated with the result of the `gcd` function. The `Gcd` module can be instantiated in a testbench, and the input signals `a` and `b` can be driven with test data to Validate the functionality of the GCD module.
