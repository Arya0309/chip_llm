  **Inputs:**

* `octal_input`: An 8-bit integer signal representing an octal number.

**Outputs:**

* `decimal_output`: A  32-bit integer signal representing the decimal equivalent of the input octal number.

**Line-by-Line Analysis:**

The provided C++/C code is a single function `octalToDecimal()` that takes an integer input `n` and converts it from an octal number to a decimal number. The function first initializes two local variables: `num` and `dec_value`, both with the same value as `n`. The function then enters a `while` loop that repeatedly extracts the last digit of the octal number `num` and multiplies it by an appropriate base value calculated as `8^(number of digits - 1)`. The product is then added to `dec_value`. The process continues until all digits of the octal number have been processed. Finally, the function returns `dec_value` as the decimal equivalent of the input octal number.

**Equivalent SystemC Code:**

The following SystemC code snippet implements the same logic as the provided C++/C code. It utilizes the same input and output signals as defined in the task.
```C++
#include "systemc.h"

// Declare a SystemC module with input and output signals and a method for performing the conversion
SC_MODULE(OctalToDecimal) {
    // Input port for the octal number
    sc_in<int> octal_input;

    // Output port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> decimal_output;

    // Method for performing the conversion
    void octalToDecimal() {
        // Initialize local variables
        int num = octal_input.read();
        int dec_value = num;
        int base = 1;

        // Loop until all digits of the octal number have been processed
        while (num) {
            // Extract the last digit
            int last_digit = num % 10;
            num = num / 10;

            // Multiply the last digit by the appropriate base value
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base *= 8;
        }

        // Write the decimal equivalent to the output port
        decimal_output.write(dec_value);
    }

    // Constructor to set up the ports and method
    SC_CTOR(OctalToDecimal) {
        SC_METHOD(octalToDecimal);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `OctalToDecimal` class implements a single method `octalToDecimal()` that takes no arguments because the input is expected to be provided through the `octal_input` signal and the output is provided through the `decimal_output` signal. The method follows the same logic as the C++/C code, extracting the last digit of the octal input, multiplying it by an appropriate base value, and adding it to the decimal equivalent. The local variables `num`, `dec_value`, and `base` are also initialized and updated as in the C++/C code. Finally, the output is written to the `decimal_output` signal.

Note that the SystemC code utilizes the same input and output signals as defined in the task, ensuring seamless integration with the existing testbench.
