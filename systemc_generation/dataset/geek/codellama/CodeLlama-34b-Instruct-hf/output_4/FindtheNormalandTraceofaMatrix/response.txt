  Inputs:

* `mat`: A 2D array of integers representing the matrix for which the trace and normal are to be found.
* `MAX`: A constant integer representing the maximum size of the matrix.

Outputs:

* `Trace`: An integer representing the trace of the matrix.
* `Normal`: An integer representing the normal of the matrix.

Summary of the C++/C Code:

The code defines two functions, `findTrace` and `findNormal`, which take a 2D array of integers and an integer representing the size of the matrix as input and return the trace and normal of the matrix, respectively.

The `findTrace` function calculates the trace of the matrix by iterating over the diagonal elements of the matrix and summing them up.

The `findNormal` function calculates the normal of the matrix by first finding the sum of the squares of the elements in the matrix and then taking the square root of the sum.

The `main` function creates a 5x5 matrix `mat` with the values shown in the code snippet and then calls the `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions to find the trace and normal of the matrix. The results are then printed to the console.

SystemC Implementation:

Here is a SystemC implementation of the `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions that utilizes the signals defined above:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Matrix) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];
    sc_out<int> trace;
    sc_out<int> norm;

    void findTrace(int mat[][SIZE], int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                sum += mat[i][j] * mat[i][j];
            }
        }
        trace.write(sum);
    }

    void findNormal(int mat[][SIZE], int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                sum += mat[i][j] * mat[i][j];
            }
        }
        norm.write(sqrt(sum));
    }
};
```
This SystemC implementation defines a `Matrix` module that has three ports: `matrix` for input, `trace` for output, and `norm` for output. The `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions are defined within the `Matrix` module and utilize the signals defined by the `sc_in` and `sc_out` types. The `findTrace` function calculates the trace of the matrix and writes it to the `trace` port, while the `findNormal` function calculates the normal of the matrix and writes it to the `norm` port.

In the `main` function, we can instantiate the `Matrix` module and call the `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions to find the trace and normal of the matrix. The results are then printed to the console.
```
int main() {
    Matrix matrix;
    matrix.findTrace(mat, 5);
    cout << "Trace of Matrix = " << matrix.trace.read() << endl;
    matrix.findNormal(mat, 5);
    cout << "Normal of Matrix = " << matrix.norm.read() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Note that in the SystemC implementation, we have used the `sc_in` and `sc_out` types to define the ports, which are used to pass data between modules in a SystemC design. We have also used the `sc_write` and `sc_read` functions to write to and read from the ports in the `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions, respectively.
