  The provided C++/C code is a program that multiplies two matrices with the dimensions R1 x C1 and R2 x C2, where R1 and R2 are the number of rows in the matrices and C1 and C2 are the number of columns in the matrices. The program takes in two 2D arrays as input, and outputs a 2D array as the result of the matrix multiplication.

Here is a line-by-line explanation of the code:

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This line includes the standard C++ header file, which includes various standard C++ libraries.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line tells the compiler to use the standard C++ namespace, which contains various standard C++ functions and variables.
3. `#define R1 2`: This line defines a macro called R1, which equates to the value 2.
4. `#define C1 2`: This line defines a macro called C1, which equates to the value 2.
5. `#define R2 2`: This line defines a macro called R2, which equates to the value 2.
6. `#define C2 3`: This line defines a macro called C2, which equates to the value 3.
7. `void mulMat(int mat1[][C1], int mat2[][C2])`: This line declares a function called mulMat, which takes in two 2D arrays of integers as input, and returns nothing. The function is defined later in the code.
8. `cout << "Multiplication of given two matrices is:\n";`: This line prints a message to the console indicating that the multiplication of the two matrices is being performed.
9. `for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {`: This line starts a loop that repeats the contents of the loop for each row in the first matrix.
10. `for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {`: This line starts a loop that repeats the contents of the loop for each column in the second matrix.
11. `rslt[i][j] = 0;`: This line sets the element at position (i, j) in the rslt array to 0.
12. `for (int k = 0; k < R2; k++) {`: This line starts a loop that repeats the contents of the loop for each row in the second matrix.
13. `rslt[i][j] += mat1[i][k] * mat2[k][j];`: This line performs the multiplication of the elements at position (i, k) in the mat1 array and position (k, j) in the mat2 array, and adds the result to the element at position (i, j) in the rslt array.
14. `cout << rslt[i][j] << "\t";`: This line prints the element at position (i, j) in the rslt array to the console.
15. `cout << endl;`: This line prints a newline character to the console.
16. `if (C1 != R2) {`: This line starts an if statement that checks whether the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.
17. `cout << "The number of columns in Matrix-1 must be equal to the number of rows in Matrix-2" << endl;`: This line prints an error message to the console if the if statement is true.
18. `cout << "Please update MACROs according to your array dimension in #define section" << endl;`: This line prints an error message to the console if the if statement is true, indicating that the MACROS for the matrix dimensions should be updated.
19. `exit(EXIT_FAILURE);`: This line exits the program with a failure code if the if statement is true.
20. `int mat1[R1][C1] = { { 1, 1 }, { 2, 2 } };`: This line defines a 2D array called mat1 with the dimensions R1 x C1, and initializes it with the values 1, 1, 2, and 2.
21. `int mat2[R2][C2] = { { 1, 1, 1 }, { 2, 2, 2 } };`: This line defines a 2D array called mat2 with the dimensions R2 x C2, and initializes it with the values 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, and 2.
22. `// Function call`: This line is a comment indicating that the mulMat function will be called.
23. `mulMat(mat1, mat2);`: This line calls the mulMat function with the mat1 and mat2 arrays as input.
24. `return 0;`: This line returns 0 from the main function, indicating that the program ran successfully.

As for the SystemC code, here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixMultiplier) {
    sc_in<int> A[SIZE_A];
    sc_in<int> B[SIZE_B];
    sc_out<int> C[SIZE_RESULT];

    void multiply() {
        int rslt[R1][C2];

        for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                rslt[i][j] = 0;

                for (int k = 0; k < R2; k++) {
                    rslt[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
                }

                C[i][j] = rslt[i][j];
            }
        }
    }

    SC_CTOR(MatrixMultiplier) {
        SC_METHOD(multiply);
        sensitive << A << B;
    }
};
```
In this code, there is a module called MatrixMultiplier that takes in two 2D arrays of integers as input and outputs a 2D array of integers. The module contains a method called multiply that performs the matrix multiplication and assigns the result to the output array C. The method is triggered by changes to the input arrays A and B.

Note that the module also includes the same MACROs as the original C++/C code to define the matrix dimensions. These MACROs ensure that the module is flexible and can be easily modified for different matrix sizes.
