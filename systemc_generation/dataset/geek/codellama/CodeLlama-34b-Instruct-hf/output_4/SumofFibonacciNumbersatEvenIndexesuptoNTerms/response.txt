  **Inputs:**

* `n`: an integer representing the number of Fibonacci numbers to consider in the sum.

**Outputs:**

* `sum`: an integer representing the sum of the even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to the `n`-th term.

**Line-by-Line Analysis:**
The C++/C code is a single function, `calculateEvenSum`, which takes an integer `n` as an input and outputs the sum of the even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to the `n`-th term.

1. The function starts by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns 0.
2. It then declares an array `fibo` of size `2 * n + 1`, and initializes the first two elements to 0 and 1, respectively.
3. It then initializes a variable `sum` to 0 and starts a for loop from 2 to `2 * n` (inclusive) to compute the remaining Fibonacci numbers using the formula: `fibo[i] = fibo[i - 1] + fibo[i - 2]`.
4. In each iteration of the loop, if the current index `i` is even, the value of `fibo[i]` is added to the `sum`.
5. The loop continues until the last iteration, and the function then returns the computed `sum`.

**Equivalent SystemC Code:**

```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds the even-indexed Fibonacci numbers
SC_MODULE(EvenFibonacciSum) {
    sc_in<int> n;  // Input port for the number of Fibonacci numbers to consider
    sc_out<int> sum;  // Output port for the sum of even-indexed Fibonacci numbers

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(EvenFibonacciSum) {
        // Process to compute the sum
        SC_METHOD(compute);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to compute the sum
    void compute() {
        int fibo[2 * n.read() + 1];
        fibo[0] = 0;
        fibo[1] = 1;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= 2 * n.read(); i++) {
            fibo[i] = fibo[i - 1] + fibo[i - 2];
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                sum += fibo[i];
            }
        }
        sum.write(sum);
    }
};
```

In this SystemC code, we create a module called `EvenFibonacciSum` that takes an input `n` and produces an output `sum`. The `compute` method is the process that performs the computation, and it is sensitive to the input `n`. The method first declares an array `fibo` of size `2 * n + 1` and initializes the first two elements to 0 and 1, respectively. It then initializes a variable `sum` to 0 and starts a for loop from 2 to `2 * n` (inclusive) to compute the remaining Fibonacci numbers using the same formula as the original C++/C code. In each iteration of the loop, if the current index `i` is even, the value of `fibo[i]` is added to the `sum`. The loop continues until the last iteration, and the `sum` is written to the output port.
