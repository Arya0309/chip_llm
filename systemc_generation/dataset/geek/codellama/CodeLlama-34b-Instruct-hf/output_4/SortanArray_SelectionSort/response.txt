  **Inputs:**

* `arr`: an array of integers to sort
* `n`: the number of elements in the array

**Outputs:**

* `arr`: the sorted array

**Summary:**

The provided code implements the selection sort algorithm in C++. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize the first element of the array as the minimum element.
2. Iterate through the array and find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array.
3. Swap the minimum element with the first element of the array.
4. Move the boundary of the unsorted subarray by one position.
5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the entire array is sorted.

The code has four functions:

1. `swap`: a function to swap two integers.
2. `selectionSort`: the selection sort algorithm.
3. `printArray`: a function to print an array.
4. `main`: the main function that tests the selection sort algorithm.

**Equivalent SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that represents the selection sort algorithm
SC_MODULE(SelectionSort) {
    sc_in<bool> clk;  // clock signal
    sc_in<bool> start;  // start signal
    sc_out<bool> done;  // done signal

    // Array of integers to sort
    sc_in<int> arr[10];

    // Number of elements in the array
    sc_in<int> n;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SelectionSort) {
        // Process to perform selection sort
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << clk.pos() << start.pos();
    }

    // Selection sort algorithm
    void sort() {
        int i, j, min_idx;

        // Initialize the first element of the array as the minimum element
        min_idx = 0;

        // Iterate through the array and find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array
        for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] < arr[min_idx]) {
                min_idx = i;
            }
        }

        // Swap the minimum element with the first element of the array
        swap(arr, min_idx, 0);

        // Move the boundary of the unsorted subarray by one position
        for (j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            swap(arr, j, j-1);
        }

        // Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the entire array is sorted
        for (i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            for (j = i; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) {
                    min_idx = j;
                }
            }
            for (j = i; j < n; j++) {
                swap(arr, j, j-1);
            }
        }

        // Signal completion
        done.write(true);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined a `SelectionSort` module that takes in an array of integers to sort, the number of elements in the array, and the clock and start signals. The module has a `sort` method that implements the selection sort algorithm described above. The `sort` method is triggered by the rising edge of the clock signal and the `start` signal. The module has an output signal `done` that is set to `true` when the sorting is complete.
