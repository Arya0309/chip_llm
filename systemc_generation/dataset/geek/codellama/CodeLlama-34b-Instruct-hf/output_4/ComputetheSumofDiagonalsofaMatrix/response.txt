  **Inputs**:

* `mat`: A 2D square array of integers.
* `n`: The size of the square matrix.

**Outputs**:

* `principal`: The sum of the elements on the principal diagonal of the matrix.
* `secondary`: The sum of the elements on the secondary diagonal of the matrix.

**Code Summary**:

The provided code defines a function `printDiagonalSums` that takes in a 2D square array of integers and its size as inputs, and computes the sum of the elements on the principal diagonal and the secondary diagonal of the matrix.

The function first initializes two variables `principal` and `secondary` to 0.

It then iterates through each row and column of the matrix using two nested for-loops.

For each element in the matrix, it checks if the element is on the principal diagonal by checking if the row index is equal to the column index. If it is, it adds the element to the `principal` variable.

It also checks if the element is on the secondary diagonal by checking if the sum of the row index and the column index is equal to the size of the matrix minus 1. If it is, it adds the element to the `secondary` variable.

After the loops are completed, the function prints out the sum of the elements on the principal and secondary diagonals to the console.

**SystemC Code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSums) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE]; // Input matrix
    sc_out<int> principal; // Output for principal diagonal sum
    sc_out<int> secondary; // Output for secondary diagonal sum

    void diagonalSums() {
        int principal = 0;
        int secondary = 0;

        // Iterate through the matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                // Check if element is on the principal diagonal
                if (i == j) {
                    principal += matrix[i][j];
                }
                // Check if element is on the secondary diagonal
                if ((i + j) == (SIZE - 1)) {
                    secondary += matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
        }

        // Print out the sums
        cout << "Principal Diagonal: " << principal << endl;
        cout << "Secondary Diagonal: " << secondary << endl;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a `DiagonalSums` module that takes in a 2D square array of integers as an input matrix, and has two output ports for the principal and secondary diagonal sums.

The module defines a `diagonalSums` method that computes the sum of the elements on the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix, using the same logic as the C++/C code.

The method iterates through the matrix, checking each element's position to determine if it is on the principal or secondary diagonal. If it is, it adds the element to the corresponding sum.

After computing the sums, the method prints out the results to the console.

To integrate this SystemC code with the provided testbench, we can simply replace the `printDiagonalSums` function call in the testbench with an instance of the `DiagonalSums` module, and connect the input port to the `matrix` signal, and the output ports to the `principal` and `secondary` signals.
