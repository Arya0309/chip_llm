  Inputs:

* `arr[]`: an array of integers
* `n`: the length of the array

Output:

* `average`: the average of the array elements

Summary of C++ code:

1. The function `average` takes an array of integers `a` and its length `n` as inputs.
2. The function first calculates the sum of the array elements using a for loop.
3. The function then divides the sum by the length of the array (i.e., `n`) to get the average.
4. The function returns the average.

In the `main` function, an array `arr` is defined with some integer values. The length of the array `n` is calculated using the `sizeof` operator. The `average` function is called with the array `arr` and its length `n` as inputs. The result of the `average` function is printed to the console.

Equivalent SystemC code:
```
// Module that calculates the average of an array of integers
SC_MODULE(Average) {
    // Input ports for the array and its length
    sc_in<int> in_array[];
    sc_in<int> in_length;

    // Output port for the average
    sc_out<int> out_average;

    // Constructor to initialize ports
    SC_CTOR(Average) {
        // Initialize input ports
        in_array.init(0, sizeof(in_array) / sizeof(in_array[0]));
        in_length.init(0);
        // Initialize output port
        out_average.init(0.0);
    }

    // Method to calculate the average
    void calculate_average() {
        // Calculate the sum of the array elements
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < in_length; i++) {
            sum += in_array[i];
        }
        // Calculate the average using the sum and the length
        double average = (double)sum / in_length;
        // Write the average to the output port
        out_average.write(average);
    }
};
```
In the `Average` module, we have three ports: `in_array`, `in_length`, and `out_average`. The `in_array` and `in_length` ports are input ports that take the array and its length as inputs, respectively. The `out_average` port is an output port that returns the average.

In the `calculate_average` method, we first calculate the sum of the array elements using a for loop. We then calculate the average using the sum and the length of the array. Finally, we write the average to the `out_average` port using the `write` method.

Note that in the SystemC code, we have used the `sc_in` and `sc_out` types to define the input and output ports, respectively. We have also used the `sc_method` construct to define a method that can be called by the SystemC simulation kernel.
