  **Inputs and Outputs**

* Inputs:
	+ `n`: A positive integer that represents the order of the Fibonacci number to be calculated.
* Outputs:
	+ `result`: The nth Fibonacci number.

**Summary**

The provided C++/C code calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a loop. The code starts by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns `n` as the Fibonacci number. Otherwise, it initializes two variables, `prev1` and `prev2`, to 1 and 0, respectively. It then declares an `int` variable called `curr` to store the current Fibonacci number.

The code then enters a `for` loop that iterates from 2 to `n`. Inside the loop, it calculates the next Fibonacci number by adding `prev1` and `prev2` and stores the result in `curr`. Then, it updates `prev2` to be the current value of `prev1`, and `prev1` to be the current value of `curr`. This continues until the loop finishes. The final value of `curr` is the nth Fibonacci number.

**SystemC Code**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Fibonacci) {
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<int> result;

    SC_METHOD(calculate) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            result.write(n);
        } else {
            int prev1 = 1;
            int prev2 = 0;
            int curr = 0;

            for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
                curr = prev1 + prev2;
                prev2 = prev1;
                prev1 = curr;
            }
            result.write(curr);
        }
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code above, we define a module called `Fibonacci` that takes two ports: `n` and `result`. The `calculate` method is sensitive to changes in `n` and calculates the Fibonacci number accordingly. The method first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it writes the value of `n` to `result`. Otherwise, it initializes `prev1` and `prev2` to 1 and 0, respectively, and declares an `int` variable called `curr` to store the current Fibonacci number.

The method then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `n`. Inside the loop, it calculates the next Fibonacci number by adding `prev1` and `prev2` and stores the result in `curr`. Then, it updates `prev2` to be the current value of `prev1`, and `prev1` to be the current value of `curr`. This continues until the loop finishes. The final value of `curr` is the nth Fibonacci number, which is written to `result`.

Note that the SystemC code includes the required signals `n` and `result`, which are connected to the appropriate ports in our testbench.
