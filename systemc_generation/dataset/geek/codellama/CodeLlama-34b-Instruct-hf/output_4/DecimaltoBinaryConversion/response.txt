  **Inputs**:

* `dec_in`: An integer input port to receive a decimal number to be converted to binary.

**Outputs**:

* `binary_out`: An integer output port that provides the binary representation of the decimal input.

**C++/C Code**:

The C++/C code defines a function `decToBinary` that takes an integer input `n` and converts it to its binary representation using a recursive approach. The function first checks if the input is zero, and if so, returns zero. Otherwise, it shifts the binary representation of `n/2` (i.e., `n` divided by 2) to the left by one bit, and sets the least significant bit (LSB) to 1 if `n` is odd.

**Line-by-Line Explanation**:

Line 1-3: This section includes the necessary header files and using namespace directives for the ISO C++ standard library.

Line 4-6: This section defines a function `decToBinary` with a single integer input `n`.

Line 7-10: This section checks if the input `n` is zero, and if so, returns zero.

Line 11-13: This section shifts the binary representation of `n/2` to the left by one bit, and sets the LSB to 1 if `n` is odd.

Line 14-16: This section recursively calls the `decToBinary` function with the updated input `n/2`.

Line 17-19: This section returns the binary representation of `n`.

**SystemC Code**:

Based on the analysis of the C++/C code, we can generate the following SystemC code that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(decToBinary) {
  sc_in<int> dec_in; // Input port for the decimal number
  sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for the binary representation

  void decToBinary() {
    int n = dec_in.read();
    if (n == 0) {
      binary_out.write(0);
      return;
    }
    int binaryNum[32];
    int i = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
      binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
      n = n / 2;
      i++;
    }
    for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
      binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
    }
  }
};
```
In the SystemC code above, we define a module `decToBinary` that has two ports: `dec_in` and `binary_out`. The `decToBinary` function takes the input `dec_in` and generates the binary representation using the same logic as the C++/C code. The `decToBinary` function is called recursively until the input is zero, at which point the function returns the binary representation through the output port `binary_out`.

Note that we have used the same signals defined in the problem statement to ensure seamless integration with the existing testbench.
