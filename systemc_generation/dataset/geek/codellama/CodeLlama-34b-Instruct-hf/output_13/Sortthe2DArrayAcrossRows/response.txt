  **Inputs:**

* `m`: a two-dimensional array representing a matrix with dimensions `r x c`, where `r` is the number of rows and `c` is the number of columns.
* `r`: the number of rows in the matrix.
* `c`: the number of columns in the matrix.

**Outputs:**

* The sorted matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix, with each row sorted in ascending order.

**Summary:**

The C++/C code provided implements a function to sort a two-dimensional array, representing a matrix, row-wise in ascending order. The function starts by declaring two variables, `i` and `j`, to be used as indices for the loop. It then iterates over each row of the matrix using a nested for loop, with the outer loop controlling the row index, `i`, and the inner loop controlling the column index, `j`.

In the inner loop, the code checks if the element at the current row and column index is greater than the element at the next column index. If it is, the function swaps the two elements using a swap function. After the inner loop completes, the row is sorted in ascending order, and the function moves on to the next row.

The function then prints the sorted matrix using a nested for loop.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Sorter) {
    sc_in<sc_matrix<int> > m;
    sc_in<int> r;
    sc_in<int> c;
    sc_out<sc_matrix<int> > sorted;

    SC_CTOR(Sorter) {
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << m << r << c;
    }

    void sort() {
        int i, j, k;
        sc_matrix<int> new_m;
        for (i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                for (k = 0; k < c - j - 1; k++) {
                    if (m[i][k] > m[i][k + 1]) {
                        swap(m[i][k], m[i][k + 1]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        sorted.write(m);
    }

private:
    void swap(sc_matrix<int> &m, int i, int j) {
        int temp = m[i];
        m[i] = m[j];
        m[j] = temp;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined a module `Sorter` that takes in the input matrix `m`, the number of rows `r`, and the number of columns `c`, and outputs the sorted matrix `sorted`. The `sort` method performs the same row-wise sorting as the C++/C code, but uses the `swap` function to swap elements in the matrix. The `swap` function is defined as a private method within the `Sorter` module.

The `sort` method is sensitive to changes in the `m`, `r`, and `c` input signals, and is triggered whenever any of them change. This ensures that the sorted matrix is updated whenever the input matrix or its dimensions change.

Note that in this SystemC code, we have used the `sc_matrix` class to represent the input and output matrices. This class is provided by the SystemC library and allows for easy manipulation of matrices in SystemC. We have also used the `sc_in` and `sc_out` ports to define the input and output signals for the `Sorter` module.
