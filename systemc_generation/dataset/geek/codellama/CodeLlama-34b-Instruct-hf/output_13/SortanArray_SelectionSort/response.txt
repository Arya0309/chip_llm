  **Inputs:**

* `arr`: An integer array that needs to be sorted.
* `n`: The number of elements in the array.

**Outputs:**

* The sorted array `arr` (the original array is sorted in place).

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code implements the selection sort algorithm, which is a simple sorting algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (i.e., the smallest value) from the unsorted portion of the array and placing it at the beginning. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array.

The code begins by including the necessary header files and declaring some global variables. The `selectionSort` function takes an integer array `arr` and its size `n` as input and sorts it in place.

The function first sets the `i` variable to 0 and then iterates through the array for i less than n-1. The inner loop iterates through the unsorted portion of the array (i.e., from i+1 to n-1) and finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion. The index of the minimum element is stored in the `min_idx` variable.

The `swap` function is then called to swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted portion (i.e., the element at index `i`). This is done by swapping the references to the elements using a temporary variable.

The outer loop then increments `i` by 1 to move the boundary of the unsorted portion by 1 element towards the end of the array. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

Once the sorting is done, the `printArray` function is called to print the sorted array.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SelectionSort) {
  // Inputs
  sc_in<int> arr[];
  sc_in<int> n;

  // Outputs
  sc_out<int> sorted_arr[];

  // Method to sort the array
  void sort() {
    int i, j, min_idx;

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      // Find the minimum element in the unsorted portion
      min_idx = i;
      for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
        if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) {
          min_idx = j;
        }
      }

      // Swap the minimum element with the first element of the unsorted portion
      if (i != min_idx) {
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[min_idx];
        arr[min_idx] = temp;
      }
    }

    // Output the sorted array
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      sorted_arr[i] = arr[i];
    }
  }

  SC_CTOR(SelectionSort) {
    SC_METHOD(sort);
    sensitive << arr << n;
    SC_METHOD(printArray);
    sensitive << sorted_arr << n;
  }

  void printArray() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cout << sorted_arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we define a module called `SelectionSort` that takes an integer array `arr` and its size `n` as input and sorts it in place. The output of the module is the sorted array `sorted_arr`.

The `sort` method sorts the array `arr` in place using the selection sort algorithm and stores the sorted array in `sorted_arr`. The `printArray` method is used to print the sorted array.

The `SelectionSort` constructor initializes the `sort` and `printArray` methods and makes them both sensitive to the `arr` and `n` inputs, respectively. This ensures that whenever the `arr` or `n` inputs change, the `sort` and `printArray` methods are called automatically.

The SystemC code is more verbose than the C++/C code, but it faithfully captures the logic of the original code and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.
