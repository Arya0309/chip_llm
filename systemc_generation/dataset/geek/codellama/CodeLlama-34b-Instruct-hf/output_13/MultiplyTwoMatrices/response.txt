  Inputs:

* `mat1`: A 2D array of integers representing the first matrix.
* `mat2`: A 2D array of integers representing the second matrix.
* `R1`: The number of rows in `mat1`.
* `C1`: The number of columns in `mat1`.
* `R2`: The number of rows in `mat2`.
* `C2`: The number of columns in `mat2`.

Outputs:

* `rslt`: A 2D array of integers representing the product of `mat1` and `mat2`.

Explanation:

The provided C++ code implements a function `mulMat` that takes two 2D arrays of integers `mat1` and `mat2` as input, and returns a 2D array `rslt` representing the product of the two matrices. The function first checks if the number of columns in `mat1` is equal to the number of rows in `mat2`, and if not, it prints an error message and exits the program. If the dimensions are correct, the function calculates the product of `mat1` and `mat2` and stores the result in `rslt`. The product is calculated by iterating over the rows and columns of `mat1` and `mat2`, and for each element, calculating the dot product of the two vectors and storing the result in the corresponding element of `rslt`.

Now, let's convert this code to SystemC. Here's a snippet that implements the same logic:
```c++
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to multiply two matrices
SC_MODULE(Multiplier) {
    // Input ports
    sc_in<int> mat1[R1][C1];
    sc_in<int> mat2[R2][C2];

    // Output port
    sc_out<int> result[R1][C2];

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Multiplier) {
        // Process to perform multiplication
        SC_METHOD(mul);
        sensitive << mat1 << mat2;
    }

    // Method to multiply the two matrices
    void mul() {
        // Check if the number of columns in mat1 is equal to the number of rows in mat2
        if (C1 != R2) {
            cout << "The number of columns in mat1 must be equal to the number of rows in mat2" << endl;
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }

        // Initialize the result matrix
        int rslt[R1][C2];

        // Multiply the matrices
        for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                rslt[i][j] = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < R2; k++) {
                    rslt[i][j] += mat1[i][k] * mat2[k][j];
                }
            }
        }

        // Copy the result to the output port
        result.write(rslt);
    }
};
```
In this code, we define a SystemC module called `Multiplier` that takes two 2D array input ports `mat1` and `mat2` and one 2D array output port `result`. The module has a process called `mul` that performs the multiplication. The process first checks if the number of columns in `mat1` is equal to the number of rows in `mat2`. If not, it prints an error message and exits the program. If the dimensions are correct, it initializes the result matrix `rslt` and calculates the product of `mat1` and `mat2` and stores the result in `rslt`. Finally, it copies the result to the output port `result`. The `mul` process is triggered when either `mat1` or `mat2` changes its value.

Note that we use the same names for the variables as in the original C++ code to make the conversion easier. However, in SystemC, it's common to use a more descriptive naming convention for the ports and signals.
