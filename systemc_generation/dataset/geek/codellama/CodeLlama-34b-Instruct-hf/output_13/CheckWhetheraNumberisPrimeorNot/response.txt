  **Inputs**:

* `n` (integer)

**Outputs**:

* `is_prime` (boolean)

**C++/C Code Summary**

The provided code is a C++ program that checks if a given integer `n` is a prime number using a simple trial division method. The program first initializes an integer variable `cnt` to 0, which will store the number of divisors of `n`.

The program then checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, and if so, it is not prime. Otherwise, it enters a loop that checks for divisors from 1 to `n`. For each divisor, the code checks if `n` is divisible by the divisor using the modulo operator `%`. If `n` is divisible by a divisor, the program increments the `cnt` variable.

After the loop is finished, the program checks if `cnt` is greater than 2. If it is, it means that `n` is divisible by more than 2 numbers and is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime. The program outputs the result using the `std::cout` statement.

**SystemC Code Snippet**

Here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that implements the same logic as the provided C++/C code:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n;  // Input port for the number to be checked
    sc_out<bool> is_prime;  // Output port for the result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        /* Process to perform the prime check */
        SC_METHOD(check_prime);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is prime
    void check_prime() {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n.read(); i++) {
            if ((n.read() % i) == 0) {
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        is_prime.write(cnt <= 2);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined a `PrimeChecker` module that takes in an input `n` and outputs the result `is_prime`. The `PrimeChecker` module contains a process called `check_prime` that implements the same logic as the provided C++/C code. The process starts by initializing a `cnt` variable to 0. It then enters a loop that checks for divisors from 1 to `n`. For each divisor, the code checks if `n` is divisible by the divisor using the modulo operator `%`. If `n` is divisible by a divisor, the process increments the `cnt` variable.

After the loop is finished, the process checks if `cnt` is greater than 2. If it is, it means that `n` is divisible by more than 2 numbers and is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime. The process outputs the result using the `is_prime.write` statement.

Note that the `PrimeChecker` module uses the `sc_in` and `sc_out` classes to define the input and output ports, respectively. These classes are part of the SystemC library and provide a convenient way to define input and output ports for a module.
