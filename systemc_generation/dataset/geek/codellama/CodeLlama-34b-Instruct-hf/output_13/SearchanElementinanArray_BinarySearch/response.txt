  Input(s):

* `v`: A vector of integers that contains the elements to be searched.
* `target`: The element that needs to be searched in the vector `v`.

Output(s):

* `found`: A boolean value that indicates whether the element `target` exists in the vector `v` or not.

Line-by-line explanation:

1. The first line includes the necessary header files.
2. The `using namespace std` statement brings all the standard library functions into scope.
3. The `binarySearch` function takes two parameters: a reference to a vector of integers `v` and an integer `target`. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the element `target` exists in the vector `v` or not.
4. The `low` and `high` variables are initialized to the first and last indices of the vector `v`, respectively.
5. The `while` loop continues until `low` is greater than `high`, which means that the vector `v` cannot be divided into more parts.
6. The `mid` variable is calculated as the midpoint between `low` and `high`.
7. If the middle element of the vector `v` (at index `mid`) is equal to the `target` element, the function returns `true`.
8. If the middle element is greater than the `target`, the `high` index is set to `mid - 1`.
9. If the middle element is less than the `target`, the `low` index is set to `mid + 1`.
10. If the loop completes without finding the `target` element, the function returns `false`.
11. The `main` function initializes a vector of integers `v` and an integer `target`.
12. The `binarySearch` function is called with `v` and `target` as arguments.
13. If the `target` element is found in the vector `v`, the function prints the message "found.".
14. If the `target` element is not found in the vector `v`, the function prints the message "NOT found.".

Now, we need to generate SystemC code that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source and utilizes the provided signals. Here's an example SystemC code that performs the same binary search algorithm as the C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Binary Search Module
SC_MODULE(BinarySearch) {
    sc_in<int>   target;      // Input target element
    sc_in<bool>  found;       // Output found/not found
    sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v;  // Input vector

    // Binary Search Algorithm
    void search() {
        int low = 0;
        int high = v.size() - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (high - low) / 2 + low;

            if (v[mid] == target) {
                found.write(true);
                return;
            }

            if (v[mid] > target)
                high = mid - 1;

            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }

        found.write(false);
    }

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinarySearch) {
        // Add sensitivity list for target and v
        SC_THREAD(search);
        sensitive << target;
        sensitive << v;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a `BinarySearch` module that contains two input ports, `target` and `v`, and one output port, `found`. The `search` method performs the iterative binary search algorithm. It takes the `target` and `v` vectors as inputs and sets the `found` output based on whether the `target` element is found in the vector or not.

Note that we have added sensitivity to both `target` and `v` vectors in the constructor to ensure that the search method is called whenever there is a change in either of the input vectors.
