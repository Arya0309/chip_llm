  **Inputs:**

* `v`: A vector of integers to be searched.
* `key`: The value to be searched in the vector.

**Outputs:**

* `i`: The index of the element in the vector that matches the key, or -1 if the key is not found.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

* `int linearSearch(vector<int> v, int key) {`: This line defines a function called `linearSearch` that takes two parameters: a vector of integers `v` and an integer `key`. The function returns an integer value.
* `// We test all the elements of the vector v against the given key`: This comment indicates that the function will compare each element of the vector `v` against the `key` to find a match.
* `for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {`: This line initializes a loop that will iterate through each element of the vector `v`. The loop will run `v.size()` times, where `v.size()` is the number of elements in the vector.
* `if (v[i] == key) {`: This line checks whether the current element of the vector `v` at index `i` matches the `key`. If the condition is true, the code inside the curly braces will be executed.
* `return i;`: This line returns the index of the matching element from the function.
* `return -1;`: This line is executed if no match is found. It returns -1 to indicate that the key was not found.
* `int main() {`: This line begins the definition of the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.
* `vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};`: This line defines a vector of integers `v` and initializes it with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 11.
* `int key = 8;`: This line defines an integer variable `key` and initializes it with the value 8.
* `// Searching the key in the vector v`: This comment indicates that the program is searching for the `key` in the vector `v`.
* `int i = linearSearch(v, key);`: This line calls the `linearSearch` function and passes the vector `v` and the `key` as parameters. The result of the function call is stored in the variable `i`.
* `if (i != -1) {`: This line checks whether the value stored in `i` is not equal to -1. If the condition is true, the code inside the curly braces will be executed.
* `cout << key << " Found at Position: " << i + 1;`: This line prints a message to the console indicating that the `key` was found at position `i + 1`.
* `else {`: This line begins the else clause of the if statement.
* `cout << key << " NOT found.";`: This line prints a message to the console indicating that the `key` was not found.
* `return 0;`: This line returns a value of 0 from the `main` function to indicate that the program executed successfully.

**SystemC Code:**

Here is an equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic of the original C++/C code and utilizes the signals defined above:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LinearSearch) {
  sc_in<int> key;
  sc_out<int> index;
  sc_vector< sc_in<int> > data;

  SC_CTOR(LinearSearch) {
    SC_CTHREAD(search, pos.write());
    sensitive << data.size();
  }

  void search() {
    for (int i = 0; i < data.size(); i++) {
      if (data[i] == key) {
        index.write(i);
        return;
      }
    }
    index.write(-1);
  }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};
  int key = 8;

  LinearSearch search0("search0");
  search0.data.bind(v);
  search0.key.write(key);
  search0.run();

  cout << "RESULT: " << search0.index.read() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `LinearSearch` that has two input ports: `key` and `data`. The `key` input port is a single integer, while the `data` input port is a vector of integers. The module also has one output port called `index`, which is also an integer.

The `SC_CTOR` constructor initializes the `search` thread, which searches the `data` vector for the `key` and stores the index of the matching element in the `index` output port. If no match is found, the `index` output port is set to -1.

In the `main` function, we create an instance of the `LinearSearch` module called `search0`. We bind the `data` vector to the `data` input port of the module, and write the `key` value to the `key` input port. We then run the `search` thread by calling the `run` method on the module.

Finally, we print the result of the search to the console by reading the `index` output port of the module. If the `index` output port is not -1, we return the value read from the `index` output port. Otherwise, we return -1 to indicate that the `key` was not found.
