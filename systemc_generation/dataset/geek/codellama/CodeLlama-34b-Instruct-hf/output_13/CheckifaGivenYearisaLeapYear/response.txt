  **Inputs:**

* `year`: An integer that represents the year to be checked.

**Outputs:**

* `is_leap_year`: A boolean that indicates whether the input year is a leap year or not.

**Code Summary:**

The provided C++/C code is a simple program that checks if a given year is a leap year or not. It contains a single function called `checkYear` that takes an integer `year` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.

The `checkYear` function uses a series of if-else statements to determine whether the year is a leap year or not. It checks if the year is divisible by 400 and returns `true` in that case. If the year is not divisible by 400, it checks if it is divisible by 100 and returns `false` in that case. If the year is not divisible by 100, it checks if it is divisible by 4 and returns `true` in that case. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The `main` function simply calls the `checkYear` function with the input year, and then prints "Leap Year" if the function returns `true` and "Not a Leap Year" if it returns `false`.

**SystemC Code Snippet:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    sc_in<int> year;  // Input port for the year
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year; // Output port for the leap year status

    SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
        // Process to check the year
        SC_METHOD(checkYear);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    void checkYear() {
        is_leap_year.write(checkYear(year.read()));
    }

    bool checkYear(int year) {
        if (year % 400 == 0) {
            return true;
        } else if (year % 100 == 0) {
            return false;
        } else if (year % 4 == 0) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code snippet, we define a module called `LeapYearChecker` that takes an input `year` and an output `is_leap_year`. The module has a single process `checkYear` that is triggered by the input `year`. The process calls the `checkYear` function, which checks if the input year is a leap year or not and returns a boolean value indicating the result. The output `is_leap_year` is written with the result of the `checkYear` function.

The `checkYear` function is the same as the one in the original C++/C code. It uses a series of if-else statements to determine whether the input year is a leap year or not.

Note that in this SystemC code, we use the `sc_cthread` construct to create a concurrent process that runs in parallel with the main thread. This allows the `is_leap_year` output to be updated as soon as the input `year` changes.
