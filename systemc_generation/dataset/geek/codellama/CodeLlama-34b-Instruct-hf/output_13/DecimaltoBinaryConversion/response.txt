  The provided C++/C code is a function that takes a decimal number as input and prints its binary representation to the console. Here is the line-by-line explanation of the code:

1. The code starts with a comment that explains its purpose: "C++ program to convert a decimal number to binary number".
2. The code includes the necessary header files: `<iostream>`.
3. The code defines a function `decToBinary` that takes an integer `n` as input and has no return type. The function is not static, so it can be called from other parts of the code.
4. The function first creates an array `binaryNum` of 32 integers, which will be used to store the binary representation of the input number.
5. The variable `i` is declared and initialized to 0. It will be used to keep track of the index of the current number in the binaryNum array.
6. The function then enters a `while` loop that runs as long as `n` is greater than 0.
7. Inside the loop, the function computes the remainder of `n` divided by 2 and stores it in the `binaryNum` array at the index `i`. This represents the least significant bit (LSB) of the binary representation.
8. The function then divides `n` by 2 and updates its value. This is repeated until `n` is 0, at which point the binary representation has been computed.
9. After the loop, the function enters a `for` loop that prints the contents of the `binaryNum` array in reverse order. This gives us the binary representation of the input decimal number.
10. The function returns `void`, indicating that it does not return any values.
11. The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It first declares a variable `n` and initializes it to 10.
12. The function then calls the `decToBinary` function, passing `n` as an argument.
13. The `main` function then returns 0, indicating that the program completed successfully.

To generate equivalent SystemC code, we can define a module that takes a decimal number as input and outputs its binary representation as a string. Here is an example:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinaryConverter) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for decimal number
    sc_out<string> binary_out;  // Output port for binary representation

    void convert() {
        // Create an array to store the binary representation
        int binaryNum[32];

        // Initialize the array
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {
            binaryNum[i] = 0;
        }

        // Get the decimal input
        const int n = dec_in.read();

        // Compute the binary representation
        int i = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }

        // Create a string to hold the binary representation
        string binaryString = "";

        // Add each bit to the string
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {
            binaryString += binaryNum[i];
        }

        // Output the binary representation
        binary_out.write(binaryString);
    }

    SC_CTOR(BinaryConverter) {
        // Process to perform conversion
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }
};
```
In this code, we define a module called `BinaryConverter` that takes an input port `dec_in` of type `int` and an output port `binary_out` of type `string`. The module has a `convert` method that performs the conversion from decimal to binary.

The method first creates an array `binaryNum` of 32 integers, which will be used to store the binary representation of the input number. It then initializes the array to zero.

The method then gets the decimal input `n` from the `dec_in` input port and computes its binary representation using a loop that runs as long as `n` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, it stores the least significant bit (LSB) of `n` in the `binaryNum` array at the index `i`. It then divides `n` by 2 and updates its value. This process is repeated until `n` is 0, at which point the binary representation has been computed.

After the loop, the method creates a string `binaryString` to hold the binary representation. It then adds each bit to the string using a loop that runs from 0 to 32. Finally, it outputs the binary representation through the `binary_out` output port.

In the constructor of the module, we define a process that calls the `convert` method whenever the `dec_in` input port changes. This ensures that the binary representation is updated whenever the input decimal number changes.
