  **Inputs:**

* `arr`: An array of integers.
* `n`: The length of the array.

**Outputs:**

* `min_val`: The minimum value in the array.
* `max_val`: The maximum value in the array.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. The first line includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which allows us to use various C++ standard library functions.
2. The second line declares the `using namespace std;` statement, which enables us to use the standard library functions without the `std::` prefix.
3. The third line declares the `getMin()` function, which takes an array of integers and its size as input and returns the minimum value in the array.
4. The fourth line declares the `getMax()` function, which takes an array of integers and its size as input and returns the maximum value in the array.
5. The fifth line declares the `main()` function, which is the entry point of the program.
6. The sixth line declares an array of integers named `arr`.
7. The seventh line calculates the size of the array using the `sizeof` operator.
8. The eighth line calls the `getMin()` function to find the minimum value in the array and stores it in a variable named `min_val`.
9. The ninth line calls the `getMax()` function to find the maximum value in the array and stores it in a variable named `max_val`.
10. The tenth line prints the minimum and maximum values to the console using the `std::cout` object.

**SystemC Equivalent:**

Here is a possible SystemC equivalent of the given C++ code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MinMax) {
    sc_in<int> arr;       // Input port for the array of integers
    sc_in<int> n;         // Input port for the size of the array
    sc_out<int> min_val;  // Output port for the minimum value
    sc_out<int> max_val;  // Output port for the maximum value

    SC_CTOR(MinMax) {
        SC_METHOD(find_min_max);
        sensitive << arr << n;
    }

    void find_min_max() {
        min_val.write(min_element(arr.read(), arr.read() + n.read()));
        max_val.write(max_element(arr.read(), arr.read() + n.read()));
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have declared three input ports: `arr`, `n`, and `n`. The `arr` port is used to input the array of integers, the `n` port is used to input the size of the array, and the `n` port is used to input the number of elements in the array. We have also declared two output ports: `min_val` and `max_val`. The `min_val` port is used to output the minimum value in the array, and the `max_val` port is used to output the maximum value in the array.

We have also defined a `find_min_max()` method, which takes no inputs but uses the `arr`, `n`, and `n` inputs to find the minimum and maximum values in the array. The method writes the results to the `min_val` and `max_val` outputs, respectively.

In this SystemC code, we have used the `min_element()` and `max_element()` functions from the SystemC standard library to find the minimum and maximum values in the array. We have also used the `read()` and `write()` methods to access and modify the input and output ports, respectively.
