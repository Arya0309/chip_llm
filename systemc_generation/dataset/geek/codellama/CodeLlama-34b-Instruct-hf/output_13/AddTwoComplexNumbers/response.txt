  **Summary of C++/C Code**:

The provided C++/C code defines a custom `Complex` class to represent a complex number with real and imaginary parts. The class has a constructor that initializes the real and imaginary parts, and a method `addComp` that adds two complex numbers and returns their sum. The code also includes a `main` function that creates two `Complex` objects and calls the `addComp` method to compute their sum.

**SystemC Equivalent**:

To generate a SystemC code that preserves the logic of the original code, we need to define a module that has input and output ports to represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers, and a method to perform the addition. Here's a SystemC code snippet that does just that:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;   // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;   // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;   // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;   // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum; // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum; // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```


In the above SystemC code, we define a `ComplexAdder` module that has input and output ports to represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers. The module also has a constructor that initializes the input and output ports, and a method `add` that performs the addition.

**Explanation**:

In the `ComplexAdder` module, we define four input ports `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2` to represent the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers to be added. We also define two output ports `real_sum` and `imag_sum` to represent the real and imaginary parts of the sum.

In the constructor, we create a process that is sensitive to the input ports `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`, and calls the `add` method whenever any of these inputs change.

In the `add` method, we add the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers and write the result to the output ports `real_sum` and `imag_sum`.

Note that we have used the same port names as the original C++/C code to facilitate testing and integration with the existing testbench.
