  **Inputs and Outputs:**

The input to the C++/C code is a 2D integer array `m` of size `n x n`, where `n` is a constant defined as 4. The output of the code is a modified version of the input array, where the elements of the first and last columns are swapped. The original array is also overwritten with the swapped elements.

 **Detailed Analysis:**

The code begins by including the `iostream` header file and defining the constant `n` to be 4. The `void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n])` function is then defined, which takes an `int` matrix of size `n x n` as input.

The function first declares an `int` variable `t` and an iterator `i` that will be used to traverse the matrix. The function then enters a loop that runs `n` times, where each iteration swaps the element at index `0` with the element at index `n-1` in the `m[i]`th row of the matrix. This loop swaps the elements of the first and last columns of the matrix.

The `main()` function then calls the `interchangeFirstLast(m)` function with the input matrix `m`. The function modifies the input matrix by swapping the elements of the first and last columns.

The modified matrix is then printed to the console using a loop that traverses the matrix and prints each element to the console.

**Equivalent SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Matrix) {
    sc_in<int> in[SIZE]; // Input matrix
    sc_out<int> out[SIZE]; // Output matrix
    int n = 4; // Size of the matrix

    // Function to swap the elements of the first and last columns
    void interchangeFirstLast() {
        int t; // Temporary variable
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            t = in[i][0];
            in[i][0] = in[i][n - 1];
            in[i][n - 1] = t;
        }
    }

    // Method to print the matrix
    void printMatrix() {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                out[i][j] = in[i][j];
                cout << out[i][j] << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Matrix) {
        // Process to perform matrix swapping and printing
        interchangeFirstLast();
        printMatrix();
    }
};
```
In the above SystemC code, we define a `Matrix` module that takes an input matrix of size `n x n` and an output matrix of the same size. The module includes a `void` function `interchangeFirstLast()` that swaps the elements of the first and last columns of the input matrix and a `void` method `printMatrix()` that prints the output matrix to the console.

In the `SC_CTOR`, we first define a `n` variable to be 4, and then define the input and output matrices. We then call the `interchangeFirstLast()` function to swap the elements of the first and last columns of the input matrix, and then call the `printMatrix()` method to print the output matrix to the console.

Note that theSystemC code uses the `sc_in<int> in[SIZE]` and `sc_out<int> out[SIZE]` signals provided in the testbench integration instructions, and incorporates the logic of the original C++/C code while also preserving the same functionality.
