  **Inputs:**

* `num`: An array of integers to be sorted.
* `len`: The length of the array.

**Outputs:**

* `num`: The sorted array.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. `void sort(int num[], int len)`: This function takes an integer array and its length as inputs, and sorts the array in ascending order.
2. `bool isSwapped`: This is a boolean variable that keeps track of whether any swaps were performed during a pass through the array.
3. `for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)`: This loop iterates over the array `num` from the first element to the last element.
4. `for (int j = 1; j < len - i; j++)`: This loop iterates over the remaining elements of the array. It starts from the second element and ends at the last element minus the current position in the outer loop.
5. `if (num[j] < num[j - 1])`: This condition checks if the current element is smaller than the previous element.
6. `swapNums(num, j, (j - 1))`: This function swaps the elements at positions `j` and `j-1` in the array.
7. `isSwapped = true`: If a swap is performed, we set `isSwapped` to `true`.
8. `if (!isSwapped) break;`: If no swaps were performed during a pass through the array, we break out of the loop.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Sort) {
    sc_in<int> num[];
    sc_in<int> len;
    sc_out<int> sorted;

    SC_CTOR(Sort) {
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << num << len;
    }

    void sort() {
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < len - i; j++) {
                if (num[j] < num[j - 1]) {
                    swapNums(num[j], num[j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        sorted.write(num);
    }

    void swapNums(int num1, int num2) {
        int temp;
        temp = num1;
        num1 = num2;
        num2 = temp;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have a module called `Sort` that takes an array of integers `num`, its length `len`, and an output port `sorted` for the sorted array. The `sort` method is sensitized to `num` and `len`, and it sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm. The `swapNums` method is used to swap elements in the array. The `sorted` output port is written with the sorted array.
