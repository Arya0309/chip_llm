  **Inputs:**

* `n`: The number until which the Fibonacci series must be generated.

**Outputs:**

* `sum`: The sum of even-indexed elements in the Fibonacci series.

**Major Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. The program first includes the required header file, `iostream`, which provides the necessary functions for input/output operations.
2. The `using namespace std;` directive brings all the functions and variables defined in the standard namespace into the current scope, which is the `std` namespace.
3. The `calculateEvenSum` function is defined, which takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of even-indexed elements in the Fibonacci series up to the `n`th term.
4. The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the function returns 0 immediately.
5. A 1D array of length `2 * n + 1` is declared, which stores the consecutive Fibonacci numbers. The array is initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1).
6. The function then calculates the remaining Fibonacci numbers by adding the previous two numbers and storing the result in the next index of the array.
7. The function then calculates the sum of even-indexed elements in the Fibonacci series by iterating over the array, skipping the odd-indexed elements, and adding the even-indexed elements to the sum.
8. The function returns the alternating sum.
9. The `main` function initializes `n` to 8 and computes the even-indexed sum of the Fibonacci series up to 8 terms using the `calculateEvenSum` function. The result is printed to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Fibonacci) {
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<int> sum;

    SC_CTOR(Fibonacci) {
        SC_METHOD(calculateEvenSum);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    void calculateEvenSum() {
        if (n <= 0) {
            sum.write(0);
            return;
        }

        int fibo[2 * n + 1];
        fibo[0] = 0, fibo[1] = 1;
        int sum = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i <= 2 * n; i++) {
            fibo[i] = fibo[i - 1] + fibo[i - 2];
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                sum += fibo[i];
            }
        }

        sum.write(sum);
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we have defined a module called `Fibonacci` that has two ports: `n` (input) and `sum` (output). The module has a single method called `calculateEvenSum` that is triggered by the `n` input port. The `calculateEvenSum` method implements the same logic as the original C++/C code, but it uses SystemC signals (`n` and `sum`) to interact with the outside world.

The `calculateEvenSum` method first checks if `n <= 0` and, if it is, it returns the value 0 directly. It also initializes the `fibo` array and the `sum` variable.

After that, it starts the loop that calculates the Fibonacci series and calculates the sum of even-indexed elements. The method uses the `fibo` array to store the intermediate values of the Fibonacci series, and it uses the `sum` variable to keep track of the sum.

At the end of the method, the sum is written to the `sum` port using the `write` method. This will make the sum available to the outside world through the `sum` signal.
