  **Input:**

* `n`: an integer value that is passed in through the `main()` function.

**Output:**

* `Even` or `Odd`: a string value indicating whether the input number is even or odd.

**Explanation:**

The C++ code provided is a simple program that checks whether a given number is even or odd using the modulo operator. The program starts by defining an integer variable `n` and initializing it with a value of 11.

The next step is to use the if-else statement to check if the value of `n` is completely divisible by 2. If the result of `n % 2` is 0, then the number is even, and the program will print "Even" to the console. Otherwise, the number is odd, and the program will print "Odd".

**SystemC Code:**

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic of the C++ code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(EvenOdd) {
    sc_in<int> number;
    sc_out<string> result;

    void checkEvenOdd() {
        if (number % 2 == 0) {
            result = "Even";
        } else {
            result = "Odd";
        }
    }

    SC_CTOR(EvenOdd) {
        SC_METHOD(checkEvenOdd);
        sensitive << number;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `EvenOdd` module has two ports: `number` and `result`. The `number` port is an input port that is connected to the `number_in` signal defined in the testbench, and the `result` port is an output port that is connected to the `result_out` signal defined in the testbench.

The `checkEvenOdd()` method is the central part of the module. It checks if the value of `number` is completely divisible by 2 using the modulo operator. If the result is 0, then the number is even, and the method sets the `result` port to "Even". Otherwise, the number is odd, and the method sets the `result` port to "Odd".

The `SC_METHOD` macro defines the `checkEvenOdd()` method as a process that is sensitive to changes in the `number` input port. This means that the method will be triggered whenever the value of `number` changes.
