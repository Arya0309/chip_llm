  **Inputs:**

* principal: The initial amount of money in the investment.
* rate: The annual percentage rate of interest.
* time: The time in years over which the money is invested.

**Output:**

* ci: The compound interest earned over the investment period.

**Summary:**

The program defines three variables:

* principal: The initial amount of money in the investment.
* rate: The annual percentage rate of interest.
* time: The time in years over which the money is invested.

It then calculates the compound interest using the formula:

Compound Interest (CI) = Principal \* (1 + (Rate/100))^Time

Finally, it prints the compound interest to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```{cpp}
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates compound interest
SC_MODULE(CompoundInterest) {
    sc_in<double> principal; // Input port for the principal amount
    sc_in<double> rate; // Input port for the annual percentage rate
    sc_in<double> time; // Input port for the time period
    sc_out<double> ci; // Output port for the compound interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterest) {
        // Process to perform compound interest calculation
        SC_METHOD(calculate_interest);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculate_interest() {
        double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + (rate.read() / 100)), time.read());
        ci.write(A - principal.read());
    }
};
```
**Explanation:**

The SystemC code defines a module named `CompoundInterest` that takes three input ports - `principal`, `rate`, and `time`. It also has one output port - `ci`.

The `calculate_interest` method is sensitive to changes in `principal`, `rate`, and `time`. Whenever one of these inputs changes, the method is triggered.

The method first calculates the compound interest using the formula:

Compound Interest (CI) = Principal \* (1 + (Rate/100))^Time

The calculation is performed using the `pow` function from the `<cmath>` library, which returns the value of `principal` raised to the power of `(1 + (rate/100))^time`.

Finally, the method subtracts the principal amount from the compound interest and writes the result to the output port `ci`.
