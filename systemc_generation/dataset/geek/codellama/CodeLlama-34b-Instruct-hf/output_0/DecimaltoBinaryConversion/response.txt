  Input:

* A decimal number represented by the integer variable `n`

Output:

* The binary representation of the input number, printed to the console

Summary:

* The program defines a function `decToBinary` that takes a decimal number `n` as input and converts it to its binary representation.
* The function first declares an array `binaryNum` of 32 integers to store the binary digits of `n`.
* The function then sets a counter `i` to 0 and enters a while loop that runs as long as `n` is greater than 0.
* Inside the loop, the function calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 2 and stores it in `binaryNum[i]`. It then divides `n` by 2 and increments `i`.
* After the loop ends, the function prints the binary representation of `n` to the console in reverse order, using another for loop that starts from `i-1` and goes backward until 0.

SystemC Code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DecimalToBinary) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out;  // Output port for the binary number

    void decToBinary() {
        int binaryNum[32];
        int i = 0;
        int n = dec_in.read();
        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `decToBinary` function is implemented in a `SC_METHOD` process, which is triggered by the `dec_in` input port. The function follows the same logic as the original C++/C code, using the `binaryNum` array to store the binary digits of the input number. The output is written to the `binary_out` output port in the reverse order, using another `SC_METHOD` process.

Note that the SystemC code uses the `sc_in`, `sc_out`, and `sc_clock` signals defined above. The `dec_in` input port is used to read the input decimal number, and the `binary_out` output port is used to write the binary representation of the input number.
