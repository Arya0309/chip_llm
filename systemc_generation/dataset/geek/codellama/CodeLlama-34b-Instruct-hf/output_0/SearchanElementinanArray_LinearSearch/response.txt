  **Inputs:**

* `v`: a vector of integers to search in
* `key`: the integer value to search for in `v`

**Outputs:**

* `index`: the index of the first occurrence of `key` in `v`, or `-1` if `key` does not occur in `v`

**Line-by-line analysis:**

* `int linearSearch(vector<int> v, int key) {` : This is the start of the `linearSearch` function. The function takes two parameters: a vector of integers `v` and an integer `key`.
* `for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {` : This starts a `for` loop that iterates over the elements of `v`. The loop variable is `i`, which is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. The loop runs until `i` is greater than or equal to the size of `v`.
* `if (v[i] == key) {` : This checks if the element at index `i` in `v` is equal to `key`. If this condition is true, the `if` statement body is executed.
* `return i;` : If the condition in the previous line is true, the index `i` is returned. This will be the index of the first occurrence of `key` in `v`.
* `}` : Closing brace for the `if` statement.
* `}` : Closing brace for the `for` loop.
* `return -1;` : If the `for` loop completes without finding `key` in `v`, this line is executed. It returns `-1` to indicate that `key` was not found in `v`.
* `int i = linearSearch(v, key);` : This line calls the `linearSearch` function with `v` and `key` as parameters. The return value of `linearSearch` is assigned to `i`.
* `if (i != -1) {` : This checks if `i` is not equal to `-1`. If this condition is true, the `if` statement body is executed.
* `cout << key << " Found at Position: " << i + 1;` : This prints a message to the console indicating that `key` was found at position `i + 1` in `v`.
* `} else {` : Closing brace for the `if` statement.
* `cout << key << " NOT found.";` : This prints a message to the console indicating that `key` was not found in `v`.
* `return 0;` : This line returns a value of 0 to indicate that the program completed successfully.

**SystemC code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

// SystemC module that implements linear search algorithm
SC_MODULE(LinearSearch) {
    sc_in<int> key;  // Input port for the key to search for
    sc_in<int> index;  // Input port for the index to start searching from
    sc_in<unsigned> n;  // Input port for the number of elements in the vector
    sc_in<sc_int> v;  // Input port for the vector of integers to search in
    sc_out<int> i;  // Output port for the index of the first occurrence of the key

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LinearSearch) {
        // Process to perform linear search
        SC_METHOD(linearSearch);
        sensitive << key << index << n;
    }

    void linearSearch() {
        index = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (v[i] == key) {
                index = i;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
Note that the SystemC code uses input ports for `key`, `index`, `n`, and `v`, and output ports for `i`. The `sensitive` attribute is used to specify that the `linearSearch` process should resume whenever any of the input ports change.
