  **Inputs**:

* `mat1`: An integer matrix with `R1` rows and `C1` columns, representing matrix 1.
* `mat2`: An integer matrix with `R2` rows and `C2` columns, representing matrix 2.
* `R1`: The number of rows in matrix 1.
* `C1`: The number of columns in matrix 1.
* `R2`: The number of rows in matrix 2.
* `C2`: The number of columns in matrix 2.

**Outputs**:

* `rslt`: The result of multiplying matrix 1 by matrix 2.

**Code Summary**:

The code starts by defining the dimensions of the two matrices as macros. The `R1`, `C1`, `R2`, and `C2` macros are defined to be 2, 2, 2, and 3, respectively. The `mulMat` function takes two matrices as input and computes the product of the two matrices. The function first initializes a 2D array `rslt` of size `R1` x `C2`, which will store the product of the two matrices.

The function then prints "The number of columns in Matrix-1 must be equal to the number of rows in Matrix-2" if the number of columns in matrix 1 is not equal to the number of rows in matrix 2. This is followed by printing "Please update MACROs according to your array dimension in #define section".

After the check, the function proceeds to compute the product of the two matrices. It does this by iterating over the rows of matrix 1 and the columns of matrix 2, and for each iteration, it multiplies the elements of the two matrices and stores the result in the corresponding element of the `rslt` matrix. Finally, the function prints the result of the multiplication.

**SystemC Code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixMultiplier) {
    sc_in<int> mat1[R1][C1];   // Input matrix 1
    sc_in<int> mat2[R2][C2];   // Input matrix 2
    sc_out<int> rslt[R1][C2];  // Output matrix

    SC_CTOR(MatrixMultiplier) {
        // Process to perform matrix multiplication
        SC_METHOD(mulMat);
        sensitive << mat1 << mat2;
    }

    void mulMat() {
        // Initialize the result matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                rslt[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }

        // Perform matrix multiplication
        for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k < R2; k++) {
                    rslt[i][j] += mat1[i][k] * mat2[k][j];
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, the `MatrixMultiplier` module takes two input matrices `mat1` and `mat2` and produces an output matrix `rslt`. The `mulMat` method is called in the constructor and is sensitive to changes in both input matrices. The method first initializes the `rslt` matrix to zero and then performs the matrix multiplication using the nested loops.
