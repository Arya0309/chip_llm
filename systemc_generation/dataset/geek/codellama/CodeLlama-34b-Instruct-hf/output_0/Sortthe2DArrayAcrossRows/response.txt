  **Inputs:**

* `m`: A 2D matrix of integers to be sorted.
* `r`: The number of rows in the matrix.
* `c`: The number of columns in the matrix.

**Outputs:**

* Sorts the input matrix `m` in-place in row-wise order and prints the sorted matrix to the console.

**Summary:**

The code defines a function `sortRowWise` that takes a 2D matrix `m` of integers, the number of rows `r`, and the number of columns `c` as input. The function first loops over each row of the matrix and sorts the elements in each row in increasing order using a bubble sort algorithm. After sorting each row, the function prints the sorted matrix to the console.

Here is a line-by-line explanation of the code:

1. Include the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which includes the standard library for C++.
2. Use the `using namespace std;` directive to import the standard library functions into the global namespace.
3. Define a helper function `swap` that takes two integer pointers `xp` and `yp` and swaps the values they point to.
4. Define the `sortRowWise` function, which takes a 2D matrix `m` of integers, the number of rows `r`, and the number of columns `c` as input.
5. Loop over each row of the matrix using a `for` loop.
6. In each row, loop over each column using a nested `for` loop.
7. In each column, loop over each element using a nested `for` loop, starting from the first element and ending at the second-last element.
8. In each iteration of the innermost loop, compare the current element with the next element and swap them if the current element is greater than the next element.
9. Once the innermost loop completes, the row is sorted in increasing order.
10. After sorting each row, print the sorted matrix to the console.
11. Define the `main` function, which serves as the entry point for the program.
12. Declare an array of arrays `m` filled with random integer values.
13. Compute the number of rows and columns in the matrix using the `sizeof` operator.
14. Call the `sortRowWise` function with the matrix, number of rows, and number of columns as input.
15. Return 0 to indicate successful execution.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include "systemc.h"

SC_MODULE(SortRowWise) {
    sc_in<int> m[10][10];      // Input matrix
    sc_in<int> r;      // Number of rows
    sc_in<int> c;      // Number of columns
    sc_out<int> sorted;    // Output matrix

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SortRowWise) {
        // Initialize input and output ports
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
                m[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }
        r = 0;
        c = 0;
        sorted = 0;
    }

    // Sorting algorithm
    void sortRowWise() {
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                // Bubble sort each row
                for (int k = 0; k < c - j - 1; k++) {
                    if (m[i][k] > m[i][k + 1]) {
                        // Swap elements
                        int temp = m[i][k];
                        m[i][k] = m[i][k + 1];
                        m[i][k + 1] = temp;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        // Print sorted matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                sorted.write(m[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `SortRowWise` module has three input ports: `m`, `r`, and `c`. The `m` port is a 10x10 matrix of integers, the `r` port is an integer representing the number of rows in the matrix, and the `c` port is an integer representing the number of columns in the matrix. The `sorted` port is an output port that contains the sorted matrix.

The `SortRowWise` module also has a `sortRowWise` function that takes no arguments. This function implements the same sorting algorithm as the C++ code, but it uses the `for` loops and `if` statements available in SystemC. The sorted matrix is printed to the console using the `sorted.write` method.

Note that this is just one possible implementation of the SystemC code, and there are many variations and optimizations that could be made depending on the specific requirements of the design.
