  **Inputs and Outputs**
The input to the code is an integer year, which is read from the user in the main function. The output is a boolean value indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.

**Summary**
The code defines a function called `checkYear` that takes an integer argument `year`. The function checks whether the year is a leap year or not based on the following conditions:

1. If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
2. If the year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is not a leap year.
3. If the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it is a leap year.
4. If the year is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year.

The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.

The main function reads an integer year from the user and calls the `checkYear` function to check if the year is a leap year. If the year is a leap year, the main function prints "Leap Year" to the console, otherwise it prints "Not a Leap Year".

**SystemC**
Here is the equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    sc_in<int> year;  // Input port for the year
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;  // Output port for the leap year status

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
        // Process to check if the year is a leap year
        SC_METHOD(checkYear);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    // Method to check if the year is a leap year
    void checkYear() {
        if (year.read() % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year.read() % 100 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        } else if (year.read() % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```
In this code, the `LeapYearChecker` module has two input and output ports: `year` and `is_leap_year`, respectively. The `checkYear` method is triggered whenever the `year` input changes, and it checks the year using the same conditions as the original C++/C code. The result is written to the `is_leap_year` output port.

Note that the signals defined in the original code (e.g., `int year`, `bool is_leap_year`) are used as input and output ports in the SystemC code to facilitate integration with the testbench.
