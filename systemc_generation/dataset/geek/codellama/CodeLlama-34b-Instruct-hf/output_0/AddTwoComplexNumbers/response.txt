  **Inputs:**

* `real1`: The real part of the first complex number.
* `imag1`: The imaginary part of the first complex number.
* `real2`: The real part of the second complex number.
* `imag2`: The imaginary part of the second complex number.

**Outputs:**

* `real_sum`: The real part of the sum of the two complex numbers.
* `imag_sum`: The imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers.

**Summary of C++/C Code:**

1. The code defines a `Complex` class that represents a complex number.
2. The `Complex` class has two member variables: `real` and `imaginary`.
3. The `Complex` class has a constructor that initializes the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
4. The `Complex` class has a method `addComp` that takes two `Complex` objects as parameters and returns their sum as another `Complex` object.
5. The `main` function creates two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` with real and imaginary parts initialized to 3 and 2, and 9 and 5, respectively.
6. The `main` function then calls the `addComp` method to add `C1` and `C2` and stores the result in `C3`.
7. The `main` function then prints the real and imaginary parts of `C3` to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a `ComplexAdder` module that has four input ports for the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers and two output ports for the real and imaginary parts of their sum. The `ComplexAdder` module has a constructor that instantiates a process to perform the addition and makes the module sensitive to all four inputs. The `add` method performs the addition and writes the results to the output ports.

The `ComplexAdder` module can be used in a SystemC testbench as follows:
```
#include "ComplexAdder.h"

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // Create instances of the ComplexAdder module
    ComplexAdder adder_1("adder_1");
    ComplexAdder adder_2("adder_2");

    // Connect the input and output ports of the adder_1 module
    adder_1.real1(3);  // Real part of complex number 1
    adder_1.imag1(2);  // Imaginary part of complex number 1
    adder_1.real2(9);  // Real part of complex number 2
    adder_1.imag2(5);  // Imaginary part of complex number 2
    adder_1.real_sum();  // Real part of the sum
    adder_1.imag_sum();  // Imaginary part of the sum

    // Connect the input and output ports of the adder_2 module
    adder_2.real1(3);  // Real part of complex number 1
    adder_2.imag1(2);  // Imaginary part of complex number 1
    adder_2.real2(9);  // Real part of complex number 2
    adder_2.imag2(5);  // Imaginary part of complex number 2
    adder_2.real_sum();  // Real part of the sum
    adder_2.imag_sum();  // Imaginary part of the sum

    return 0;
}
```
In this testbench, we create two instances of the `ComplexAdder` module, `adder_1` and `adder_2`, and connect their input and output ports accordingly. The `adder_1` module performs the addition of two complex numbers, 3 + 2i and 9 + 5i, and the `adder_2` module performs the addition of two complex numbers, 3 + 2i and 9 + 5i, again. The results are stored in the output ports of each module, which can be accessed in the simulation.
