  **Inputs:**

* `nums[]`: an array of integers to be sorted
* `len`: the length of the `nums[]` array

**Outputs:**

* `nums[]`: the sorted array

**Line-by-line summary:**

1. The program starts with a banner that declares the file to be a C++ program and includes the standard library.
2. The `using namespace std` statement allows the use of the standard library without the need to prefix everything with `std::`.
3. The `sort` function is declared, along with two additional functions: `swapNums` and `main`.
4. The `sort` function takes an array of integers and its length as input. It sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm, which exchanges adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The function checks if a swap has occurred in the previous iteration, and if it hasn't, it breaks out of the loop.
5. The `swapNums` function takes an array of integers, the indices of two elements to be swapped, and swaps them.
6. The `main` function initializes an array of integers with some predefined values, prints the array to the console, calls the `sort` function to sort the array, and then prints the sorted array to the console.

**SystemC code:**

To generate a SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source, we need to create a module that takes the input array, length, and output array as ports. We can then implement the sorting logic in the module using SystemC constructs.

Here is a possible SystemC code snippet that captures the logic of the original C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BubbleSort) {
    sc_in<int> nums[];      // Input array of integers to be sorted
    sc_in<int> len;         // Length of the input array
    sc_out<int> sorted[];   // Output sorted array
    sc_signal<bool> is_swapped; // Used to check if a swap has occurred

    // Constructor to initialize ports
    SC_CTOR(BubbleSort) {
        // Process to perform bubble sort
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        // We need to check if a swap has occurred,
        // so we use a separate signal to check it
        SC_METHOD(check_swap);
    }

    // Method to perform bubble sort
    void sort() {
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < len - i; j++) {
                if (nums[j] < nums[j-1]) {
                    swapNums(nums, j, (j-1));
                    is_swapped.write(true);
                }
            }
            if (!is_swapped.read()) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // Method to check if a swap has occurred
    void check_swap() {
        is_swapped.write(false);
    }

    // Method to swap two numbers in the array
    void swapNums(int nums[], int first, int second) {
        int curr = nums[first];
        nums[first] = nums[second];
        nums[second] = curr;
    }
};
```
This SystemC code defines a module called `BubbleSort` that has four ports: two input ports (`nums[]` for the input array and `len` for the length of the array), one output port (`sorted[]` for the sorted array), and one signal (`is_swapped`) to check if a swap has occurred. The constructor initializes the ports and processes to perform the bubble sort and check if a swap has occurred. The `sort` method implements the bubble sort algorithm, and the `check_swap` method checks if a swap has occurred. The `swapNums` method swaps two numbers in the array.

Note that this is just one possible implementation of the SystemC code to preserve the logic of the original C++/C source. There are many other ways to implement the same logic using SystemC constructs.
