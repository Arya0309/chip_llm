  **Inputs:**

* `num`: The number for which the factorial is to be computed.

**Outputs:**

* `cout`: The output stream where the factorial of `num` is displayed.

**Line-by-line explanation:**

1. `// C++ program for factorial of a number`: A comment indicating the purpose of the code.
2. `include <iostream>`: A header file that provides input and output functionality.
3. `using namespace std;`: A directive that allows the user to access the contents of the standard namespace without having to prefix them with `std::`.
4. `// Function to find factorial of`: A comment indicating the purpose of the following code block.
5. `unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)`: The declaration of a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer argument named `n` and returns an unsigned integer.
6. `int res = 1, i;`: The declaration and initialization of two integer variables named `res` and `i`.
7. `for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)`: A for loop that iterates from 2 to `n` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
8. `res *= i;`: In each iteration, the value of `res` is multiplied by `i`.
9. `return res;`: The value of `res` is returned as the result of the `factorial` function.
10. `// Driver code`: A comment indicating the start of the driver code.
11. `int main()`: The declaration of the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.
12. `int num = 5;`: The declaration and initialization of an integer variable named `num` with the value 5.
13. `cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is "`: The `cout` statement prints the string "Factorial of " followed by the value of `num`.
14. `factorial(num) << endl;`: The `factorial` function is called with `num` as its argument and the result is inserted into the `cout` statement using the `insertion operator`. The `endl` manipulator is used to insert a newline character and flush the buffer.
15. `return 0;`: The `main` function returns the value 0 to indicate successful completion.

**Equivalent SystemC code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> num;  // Input port for the number
    sc_out<unsigned int> factorial;  // Output port for the factorial

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
        // Process to compute the factorial
        SC_METHOD(compute_factorial);
        sensitive << num;
    }

    // Method to compute the factorial
    void compute_factorial() {
        unsigned int res = 1, i;
        for (i = 2; i <= num.read(); i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        factorial.write(res);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the module `Factorial` has two ports: an input port named `num` of type `sc_in<unsigned int>` and an output port named `factorial` of type `sc_out<unsigned int>`. The `compute_factorial` method is responsible for computing the factorial of the input number and storing the result in the `factorial` output port. The `sensitive` statement is used to specify that the method is sensitive to changes in the value of `num`. When the value of `num` changes, the `compute_factorial` method is triggered and the factorial is recomputed and stored in the `factorial` output port.
