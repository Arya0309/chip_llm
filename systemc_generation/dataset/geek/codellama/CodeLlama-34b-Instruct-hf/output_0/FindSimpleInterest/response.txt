  **Inputs:**

* P: Principal amount of the loan
* R: Rate of interest
* T: Time (in years) for which the interest is being calculated

**Output:**

* SI: Simple interest calculated using the principal amount, rate of interest, and time

**Line-by-line explanation:**

1. The program prompts the user to enter the principal amount (P), rate of interest (R), and time (T) in years.
2. The program calculates the simple interest using the formula: `SI = (P * T * R) / 100`
3. The program then prints the resultant value of SI.

**SystemC code equivalent:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SimpleInterest) {
    sc_in<float> P;
    sc_in<float> R;
    sc_in<float> T;
    sc_out<float> SI;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SimpleInterest) {
        // Process to calculate simple interest
        SC_METHOD(calculate);
        sensitive << P << R << T;
    }

    // Method to calculate simple interest
    void calculate() {
        SI.write((P.read() * T.read() * R.read()) / 100);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined an `sc_in` port for each input signal (P, R, and T), and an `sc_out` port for the output signal SI. We have also defined a constructor that instantiates the process to calculate simple interest and makes it sensitive to changes in the input signals. Finally, we have defined a method to calculate simple interest that writes the result to the output port SI.
