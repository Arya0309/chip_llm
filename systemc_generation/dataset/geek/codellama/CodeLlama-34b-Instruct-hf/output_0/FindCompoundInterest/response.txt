  **Inputs**:

* `principal`: a double representing the initial investment or principal amount
* `rate`: a double representing the interest rate as a percentage
* `time`: a double representing the time period in years

**Outputs**:

* `ci`: a double representing the compound interest

**Line-by-line explanation**:

1. `double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;`
	* Declare and initialize three local variables: `principal`, `rate`, and `time`.
	* Their values are set to 10000, 5, and 2 respectively.
2. `double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time));`
	* Calculate the compound interest over the given time period using the formula: `A = P * (1 + r/100)^t`.
	* `P` is the principal, `r` is the interest rate, and `t` is the time period.
	* Here, `P` is set to `principal`, `r` is set to `rate/100`, and `t` is set to `time`.
	* The `pow` function is used to compute the result of `(1 + rate/100)` to the power of `time`.
3. `double CI = A - principal;`
	* Calculate the compound interest by subtracting the initial principal from the compound interest over the time period.
	* The result is stored in the local variable `CI`.
4. `cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;`
	* Output the compound interest to the console.

**SystemC Code**:
```scss
#include <systemc>

SC_MODULE(CompoundInterest) {
	sc_in<double> principal;
	sc_in<double> rate;
	sc_in<double> time;
	sc_out<double> ci;

	SC_CTOR(CompoundInterest) {
		// Calculate compound interest
		CI = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));
		ci.write(CI);
	}
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module named `CompoundInterest` that takes the same inputs and produces the same output as the original C++/C code. The module has three input ports: `principal`, `rate`, and `time`, which are connected to the signals `sc_in<double> principal`, `rate`, and `time`. The module also has one output port, `ci`, which is connected to the signal `sc_out<double> ci`.

The module constructor `SC_CTOR` calculates the compound interest using the formula `A = P * (1 + r/100)^t`, where `P` is the principal, `r` is the interest rate, and `t` is the time period. The result is stored in the local variable `CI` and written to the output port `ci.write(CI)`.
