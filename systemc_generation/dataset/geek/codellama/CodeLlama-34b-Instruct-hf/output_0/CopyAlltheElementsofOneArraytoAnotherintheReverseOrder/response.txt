  **Inputs:**

* `original_arr`: an integer array containing the original data to be copied
* `len`: an integer indicating the length of `original_arr`

**Outputs:**

* `copied_arr`: an integer array containing the copied data from `original_arr` in reverse order

**Summary:**

The provided C code defines a function, `printArray`, which takes an integer array and its length as input and prints the contents of the array to the console. The main function then initializes an integer array, `original_arr`, with some sample data and calculates the length of the array. It then declares an integer array, `copied_arr`, with the same length as `original_arr`.

The main function then enters a loop that iterates over each element of `original_arr` and copies its value to the corresponding position in `copied_arr`, but in reverse order. The loop starts from the end of `original_arr` and iterates backwards to the beginning.

After the copy is complete, the main function prints the original and copied arrays to the console using the `printArray` function.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArrayReverser) {
    sc_in<bool> clk;
    sc_in<bool> start;
    sc_out<bool> done;

    // Original array and length
    sc_in<int> original_arr[5];
    sc_in<int> len = 5;

    // Copied array and length
    sc_out<int> copied_arr[5];
    sc_out<int> copied_len = 5;

    // Process to perform array reversal
    SC_THREAD(reverse) {
        // Wait for start signal
        wait();

        // Copy the elements of the array in reverse order
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            copied_arr[i] = original_arr[len - i - 1];
        }

        // Signal that the copy is complete
        done.write(true);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `ArrayReverser` that takes in the original array and its length, and produces the copied array and its length as outputs. The module has three input signals: `clk`, `start`, and `original_arr[5]`. It also has two output signals: `done` and `copied_arr[5]`.

The `reverse` process runs when the `start` signal is active. It loops over the elements of the `original_arr` array in reverse order, copies the values to the corresponding positions in the `copied_arr` array, and signals that the copy is complete when the loop is finished.

The code uses the `sc_in` and `sc_out` types to declare the input and output ports, and the `sc_thread` type to define the `reverse` process. The `sc_write` method is used to write the copied data to the `copied_arr` port.
