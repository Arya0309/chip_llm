  Inputs:

* a: The first number to be swapped.
* b: The second number to be swapped.

Outputs:

* a: The first number after swapping.
* b: The second number after swapping.

Line-by-line explanation:

* `int a = 2, b = 3;`: Declares two integer variables `a` and `b` and initializes them to 2 and 3, respectively.
* `cout << "Before swapping a = " << a << " , b = " << b << endl;`: Prints the message "Before swapping a = " followed by the value of `a`, then " , b = " followed by the value of `b`, and finally a newline character. This line is used to display the original values of `a` and `b` before swapping.
* `temp = a;`: Declares a temporary variable `temp` and sets its value to `a`.
* `a = b;`: Sets the value of `a` to `b`.
* `b = temp;`: Sets the value of `b` to `temp`.
* `cout << "After swapping a = " << a << " , b = " << b << endl;`: Prints the message "After swapping a = " followed by the value of `a`, then " , b = " followed by the value of `b`, and finally a newline character. This line is used to display the new values of `a` and `b` after swapping.

The program simply swaps the values of `a` and `b` using a temporary variable `temp`.

Here is the SystemC code that implements the same logic:
```c
#include <systemc.h>

sc_module(Swapper) {
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;
    sc_out<int> out_a;
    sc_out<int> out_b;

    void swapping() {
        int temp = a; // temporary variable for storing the value of a
        a = b; // set a to the value of b
        b = temp; // set b to the value of temp
        out_a.write(a.read()); // write the new value of a to out_a
        out_b.write(b.read()); // write the new value of b to out_b
    }
}
```
The SystemC code implements the same logic as the C++ program, but it uses the `sc_in` and `sc_out` ports to communicate with the external world. The `swapping()` method is called when the `a` and `b` inputs change, and it swaps the values of `a` and `b` using a temporary variable `temp`. The new values of `a` and `b` are then written to the `out_a` and `out_b` output ports.
