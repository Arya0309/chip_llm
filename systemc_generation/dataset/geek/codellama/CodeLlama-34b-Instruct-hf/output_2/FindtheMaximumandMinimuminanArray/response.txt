  **Inputs:**

* `arr[]`: an array of integer elements
* `n`: the size of the array

**Outputs:**

* `min_val`: the minimum element in the array
* `max_val`: the maximum element in the array

**Major Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. `int getMin(int arr[], int n)`:
	* This function takes an array of integers and its size as input, and returns the minimum element in the array.
	* The function uses the `min_element` function from the C++ standard library to find the minimum element.
	* The `min_element` function takes two arguments: an iterator to the beginning of the array, and an iterator to the end of the array.
	* The function returns the minimum element found, which is passed to the `cout` statement in `main()`.
2. `int getMax(int arr[], int n)`:
	* This function is similar to `getMin`, but it finds the maximum element in the array instead.
	* The function uses the `max_element` function from the C++ standard library, which works the same way as `min_element`.
3. `main()`:
	* This is the main function of the program, where the program starts executing.
	* The function declares an array of integer elements, and sets its size to 5.
	* The function calls `getMin` and `getMax` with the array and its size as arguments, and prints the results to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MinMax) {
    sc_in<int> arr[5];  // Input port for the array
    sc_out<int> min_val;  // Output port for the minimum value
    sc_out<int> max_val;  // Output port for the maximum value

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MinMax) {
        // Process to find the minimum and maximum elements
        SC_METHOD(compute);
        sensitive << arr;
    }

    // Method to compute the minimum and maximum elements
    void compute() {
        // Find the minimum and maximum elements
        int min = INT_MAX;
        int max = INT_MIN;
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            if (arr[i] < min) min = arr[i];
            if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
        }

        // Output the results
        min_val.write(min);
        max_val.write(max);
    }
};

```

**Explanation:**

The provided SystemC code defines a module called `MinMax`, which has three ports: `arr`, `min_val`, and `max_val`. The `arr` port is an input port that takes an array of integers, and the `min_val` and `max_val` ports are output ports that indicate the minimum and maximum values in the array, respectively.

The `MinMax` module has a single process called `compute`, which is sensitive to the `arr` port. This means that whenever the `arr` port is written to, the `compute` process is executed.

The `compute` process iterates over the elements of the `arr` array and finds the minimum and maximum elements. The minimum element is stored in the `min` variable, and the maximum element is stored in the `max` variable.

Finally, the `compute` process writes the minimum and maximum values to the `min_val` and `max_val` ports, respectively. These values are then available for other modules to read.

Note that the SystemC code does not use the `clk` and `start` signals, as they are not necessary for this specific module. However, these signals can be used to control the execution of the `compute` process and ensure that it only runs when the clock signal is high and the start signal is active.
