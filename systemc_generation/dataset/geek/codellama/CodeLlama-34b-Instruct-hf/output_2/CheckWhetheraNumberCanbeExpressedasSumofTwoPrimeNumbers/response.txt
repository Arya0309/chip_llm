  The C++/C code provided is a program that checks if a prime number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. It has the following inputs and outputs:

* Inputs:
	+ `n`: A positive integer.
* Outputs:
	+ `result`: A boolean value indicating whether `n` can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

The program defines two functions: `isPrime`, which checks if a given number is prime, and `isPossible`, which checks if `n` can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The `main` function is the driver code that calls `isPossible` with `n` as an argument and prints "Yes" if the result is true, and "No" otherwise.

In English, the program can be described as follows:

1. The `isPrime` function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n`. If `n` is not prime, the function returns `false`.
2. The `isPossible` function takes an integer `N` as input and checks if it is prime and `N-2` is also prime. If both conditions are true, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
3. The `main` function takes no input and calls `isPossible` with `n` as an argument. If the result is `true`, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

Here is a SystemC code snippet that reflects the logic of the C++/C code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks if a prime number can be expressed as sum of two Prime Numbers 
SC_MODULE(Checker) {
    sc_in<int> n_in; // Input port for the prime number
    sc_out<bool> result_out; // Output port for the result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Checker) {
        // Process to check if the prime number can be expressed as sum of two prime numbers
        SC_METHOD(check);
        sensitive << n_in;
    }

    // Method to check if the prime number can be expressed as sum of two prime numbers
    void check() {
        int n = n_in.read();
        bool is_prime = isPrime(n);
        result_out.write(is_prime && isPrime(n-2));
    }
};
```
In this code, we define a `Checker` module that has an input port `n_in` for the prime number and an output port `result_out` for the result. The `check` method is sensitive to `n_in` and performs the necessary checks to determine if `n` can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The result is written to `result_out`.

Note that we have defined the `isPrime` function within the `Checker` module, so that it is accessible to the `check` method.
