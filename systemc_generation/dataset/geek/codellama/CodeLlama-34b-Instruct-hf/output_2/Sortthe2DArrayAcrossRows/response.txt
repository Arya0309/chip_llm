  **Inputs:**

* `m`: A 2D array of integers representing the matrix to be sorted.
* `r`: The number of rows in the matrix.
* `c`: The number of columns in the matrix.

**Outputs:**

* The sorted matrix `m` after performing row-wise sorting.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code defines a function `sortRowWise` that takes a 2D array of integers `m`, the number of rows `r`, and the number of columns `c` as inputs, and sorts the matrix row-wise. The function first loops through each row of the matrix and then loops through each column of the row to compare adjacent elements. If an element is less than its adjacent element, the function swaps them. This process continues until all elements in the row are sorted. The function then prints the sorted matrix to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(RowWiseSort) {
    sc_in<bool> clk;
    sc_in<bool> start;
    sc_out<bool> done;
    sc_in<int> m[32][32]; // Assume max 32x32 matrix
    sc_in<int> r; // Number of rows
    sc_in<int> c; // Number of columns

    void sortRowWise(int m[][], int r, int c) {
        // Loop through each row
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            // Loop through each column
            for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                // Loop through each element in the row
                for (int k = 0; k < c - j - 1; k++) {
                    if (m[i][k] > m[i][k + 1]) {
                        // Swap elements
                        int temp = m[i][k];
                        m[i][k] = m[i][k + 1];
                        m[i][k + 1] = temp;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(RowWiseSort) {
        // Initialize ports
        clk(clk);
        start(start);
        done(done);
        m(m);
        r(r);
        c(c);
        // Add reset functionality
        SC_METHOD(sortRowWise);
        sensitive << clk.pos();
        // Configure done to be asserted after sorting is complete
        done.write(true);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `RowWiseSort` that contains the necessary ports to interface with the testbench. The module contains the same functionality as the original C++/C code, with the addition of a `sortRowWise` method that is sensitive to the clock signal. The method sorts the matrix row-wise and asserts the `done` output when the sorting is complete. The `sortRowWise` method is called when the `start` input is asserted.
