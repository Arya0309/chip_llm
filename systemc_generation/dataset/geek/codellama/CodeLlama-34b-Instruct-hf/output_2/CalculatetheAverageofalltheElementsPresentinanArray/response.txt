  **Inputs**:

* `arr`: an array of integers
* `n`: the size of the array

**Outputs**:

* `average_out`: the average of the array elements

**Summary**:

The provided C++ code defines a function `average` that calculates the average of an array of integers. The function takes two arguments: `a`, which is an array of integers, and `n`, which is the size of the array. The function calculates the sum of the array elements using a for loop and then divides the sum by the number of elements to get the average. The calculated average is returned by the function.

The driver code defines an array `arr` of integers and its size `n`, and calls the `average` function with `arr` and `n` as arguments. The output of the function is printed to the console using `cout`.

**SystemC Code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates the average of an array of integers
SC_MODULE(AverageCalculator) {
    // Inputs
    sc_vector<sc_in<int>> data_in; // Input port for the array of integers
    sc_in<size_t> n;               // Input port for the size of the array
    
    // Output
    sc_out<double> average_out;  // Output port for the average of the array elements
    
    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(AverageCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate the average
        SC_METHOD(calculate_average);
        sensitive << data_in << n;
    }
    
    // Method to calculate the average
    void calculate_average() {
        // Calculate the sum of the array elements
        int sum = 0;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < n.read(); i++) {
            sum += data_in[i].read();
        }
        // Calculate the average
        double average = (double)sum / n.read();
        // Write the output to the port
        average_out.write(average);
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we define a module `AverageCalculator` that takes two inputs:

* `data_in`: a vector of input ports for the array of integers
* `n`: an input port for the size of the array

The module has one output port:

* `average_out`: output port for the average of the array elements

The module has a constructor that defines a process for calculating the average. The process is triggered by the inputs `data_in` and `n`. It calculates the sum of the array elements using a for loop and then divides the sum by the number of elements to get the average. The average is written to the output port `average_out`.

The SystemC code follows the structure of the original C++ code while using the provided signals to ensure seamless integration with our existing testbench.
