  **Inputs:**

* `data`: A vector of integers to search.
* `key`: The value to search for in the vector.

**Outputs:**

* `index`: The index of the first occurrence of `key` in the vector, or -1 if it is not found.

**Summary:**
The provided C++/C code implements a linear search algorithm to search for the first occurrence of a given value in a vector. The function `linearSearch` takes two inputs: a vector of integers `v` and an integer `key`. The function iterates through the vector using a for loop and checks if the value at each index is equal to `key`. If `key` is found, the function returns the index of the first occurrence. If `key` is not found, the function returns -1.

The main function creates a vector `v` with the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11] and an integer `key` with the value 8. The function `linearSearch` is called with these values, and the output is printed to the console.

**Equivalent SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LinearSearch) {
  sc_in<std::vector<int>> data; // Input port for the vector of integers
  sc_in<int> key; // Input port for the value to search
  sc_out<int> index; // Output port for the index of the first occurrence of key

  // Constructor
  SC_CTOR(LinearSearch) {
    // Process to perform the linear search
    SC_METHOD(search);
    sensitive << data << key;
  }

  // Method to search for the key in the vector
  void search() {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < data.size(); i++) {
      if (data[i] == key) {
        // Key found, return the index
        index.write(i);
        break;
      }
    }
    if (i == data.size()) {
      // Key not found, return -1
      index.write(-1);
    }
  }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `LinearSearch` that takes two input ports: a vector of integers `data` and an integer `key`. The module also has an output port `index` that returns the index of the first occurrence of `key` in the input vector.

The constructor `SC_CTOR` creates a process `search` that is triggered when the inputs `data` and `key` change. The process iterates through the input vector using a for loop and checks if the value at each index is equal to `key`. If `key` is found, the index is written to the output port `index`. If `key` is not found, the output port is set to -1.
