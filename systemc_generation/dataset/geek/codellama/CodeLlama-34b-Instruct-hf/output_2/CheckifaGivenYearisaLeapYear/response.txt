  **Summary:**

The provided C++/C code is a simple program that takes in an input "year" and checks whether it is a leap year or not. It uses a function called "checkYear" to perform the check. The function checks the input year and returns a boolean value indicating whether it is a leap year or not. The main function of the program takes in the year as input, calls the checkYear function, and then outputs whether the year is a leap year or not using a conditional statement.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

The code starts by includes the appropriate header file:
```#include <iostream>
```
This header file provides the necessary functionality to perform input and output operations.

Next, the code uses the "using namespace std;" statement to bring all the symbols from the standard namespace into the global namespace.

The following line defines the function "checkYear", which takes in an integer argument called "year".
```
bool checkYear(int year)
{
```
The function checks if the year is divisible by 400 using the modulo operator (%). If it is, then it returns true, indicating that the year is a leap year.
```
if (year % 400 == 0) {
        return true;
```
If the year is not divisible by 400, then the function checks if it is divisible by 100. If it is, then it returns false, indicating that the year is not a leap year.
```
else if (year % 100 == 0) {
        return false;
```
If the year is not divisible by 100, then the function checks if it is divisible by 4. If it is, then it returns true, indicating that the year is a leap year.
```
else if (year % 4 == 0) {
        return true;
```
If the year is not divisible by 4, then it is not a leap year.
```
else {
        return false;
```
The last line of the code defines the main function, which takes in the integer argument "year" and calls the checkYear function with the year as an argument. Based on the return value of the function, it outputs whether the year is a leap year or not using a conditional statement.
```
int main()
{
    int year = 2000;

    checkYear(year) ? cout << "Leap Year"
            		: cout << "Not a Leap Year";

    return 0;
}
```
**SystemC Code:**

Here is a SystemC code snippet that captures the same logic as the original C++/C code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    sc_in<int> year;  // Input port for the year
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;  // Output port for the leap year status

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
        // Process to perform the leap year check
        SC_METHOD(checkLeapYear);
        sensitive << year;
        is_leap_year.write(checkLeapYear());
    }

    // Method to check if the year is a leap year
    bool checkLeapYear() {
        if (year.read() % 400 == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        else if (year.read() % 100 == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        else if (year.read() % 4 == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        else {
            return false;
        }
    }
};
```
In this code, we define a module called "LeapYearChecker" that has an input port called "year" and an output port called "is_leap_year". The module has a method called "checkLeapYear" that takes no arguments and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input year is a leap year or not. The method checks the year using the same logic as the original C++/C code.

In the constructor of the module, we create a process called "checkLeapYear" that is sensitive to the input port "year". Whenever the value of the input port changes, the process is triggered and the "checkLeapYear" method is called. The return value of the method is written to the output port "is_leap_year".
