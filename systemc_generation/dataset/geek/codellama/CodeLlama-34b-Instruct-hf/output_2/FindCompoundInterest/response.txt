  **C++/C Code Summary:**
The provided code is a C++ program that calculates compound interest for a given principal amount, rate, and time. The code first declares the principal amount, interest rate, and time in years as double-precision floating-point variables. Then, it calculates the compound interest using the formula: A = P * (1 + r/100)^t, where P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years. The code then calculates the difference between the compound interest and the principal amount to get the total compound interest. Finally, the code prints the total compound interest to the console.

**SystemC Code Snippet:**
The SystemC code snippet represents the same functionality as the given C++/C code. The module has four ports:

* principal (sc_in<double>): Input port for the principal amount.
* rate (sc_in<double>): Input port for the interest rate.
* time (sc_in<double>): Input port for the time in years.
* ci (sc_out<double>): Output port for the compound interest.

The module has a single method, "compoundInterest," which performs the following operations:

* Calculates the compound interest using the formula: A = P \* (1 + r/100)^t.
* Retrieves the principal amount, rate, and time from the respective input ports.
* Calculates the total compound interest by subtracting the principal amount from the compound interest.
* Writes the total compound interest to the output port.

Here is the SystemC code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates compound interest.
SC_MODULE(CompoundInterest) {
    sc_in<double> principal; // Input port for the principal amount.
    sc_in<double> rate; // Input port for the interest rate.
    sc_in<double> time; // Input port for the time in years.
    sc_out<double> ci; // Output port for the compound interest.

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterest) {
        // Process to perform compound interest calculation.
        SC_METHOD(compoundInterest);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest.
    void compoundInterest() {
        double A = principal.read() * (1.0 + rate.read() / 100.0) / pow(1.0 + rate.read() / 100.0, time.read());
        ci.write(A - principal.read());
    }
};
```
