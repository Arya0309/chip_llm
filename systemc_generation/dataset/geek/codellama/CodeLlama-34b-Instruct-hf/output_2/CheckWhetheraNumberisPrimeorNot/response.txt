  **Inputs and Outputs**:

1. `n`: an integer value passed as an argument to the `main()` function and used as an input to the algorithm.
2. `is_prime`: a boolean value output by the algorithm, indicating whether the input number `n` is prime or not.

**Line-by-Line Block-by-Block Explanation**:

The code begins with the inclusion of the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which imports the C++ standard library. This allows the use of standard C++ library functions and data structures.

The next line declares the `main()` function, which is the entry point for the program.

The `main()` function begins by declaring two variables:

1. `n`: an integer value initialized to `29`. This is the input value for the algorithm.
2. `cnt`: an integer value initialized to `0`. This variable will be used to count the number of divisors for the input value `n`.

The next block of code is an `if` statement that checks whether the input value `n` is less than or equal to `1`. If it is, then the algorithm immediately prints the message "is NOT prime" and exits the function.

Otherwise, the algorithm enters the `else` block, which performs the following operations:

1. Declares an integer variable `i` and initializes it to `1`.
2. Enters a `for` loop that iterates `i` from `1` to `n`.
3. Inside the loop, the algorithm checks whether `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator `%`. If it is, then the algorithm increments the `cnt` variable by `1`.
4. After the loop, the algorithm checks whether `cnt` is greater than `2`. If it is, then the algorithm prints the message "is NOT prime" and exits the function.
5. Otherwise, the algorithm prints the message "is prime" and exits the function.

**SystemC Code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<bool> is_prime;

    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        SC_METHOD(check);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    void check() {
        if (n <= 1) {
            is_prime.write(false);
            return;
        }

        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                cnt++;
            }
        }

        is_prime.write(cnt >= 2);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `PrimeChecker` module takes in an input of type `sc_in<int>` and returns an output of type `sc_out<bool>`. The `check()` method performs the prime number check by using a similar algorithm as the C++/C code. The `for` loop is replaced with a `do-while` loop, which is more suitable for the SystemC paradigm. Additionally, the `SC_METHOD` call is used to specify that the `check()` method is a method that can be triggered by changes to the input signals.
