  **Tasks**:

1. Read and thoroughly analyze the provided C++/C code.
2. Identify the input(s) and output(s) of the code.
3. Provide a detailed, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language summary that explains:
    - The inputs and outputs of the code.
    - Each major line or block of code and its functionality (e.g., declarations, loops, conditions, data transformations).
4. Finally, based on your analysis, generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.

**Provided Signals** (for testbench integration):

`sc_in<int> n;`

`sc_out<int> result;`

**C++/C Code**:
```cpp
// C++ Program to find the nth fibonacci number using loops
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int fib(int n) {
    // For 0th and 1st term
    if (n <= 1)
        return n;

    // Variable to store the last two terms
    int prev1 = 1, prev2 = 0;

    // Variable that stores the current fibonacci term
    int curr;

    // Calculating the next fibonacci number by using
    // the previous two number
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        curr = prev1 + prev2;
        prev2 = prev1;
        prev1 = curr;
    }
    return curr;
}

int main() {
    // Finding the nth fibonacci number
    cout << fib(6);
    return 0;
}
```

**Instructions**:

- Your answer must explicitly list the inputs and outputs.
- Your answer must include a clear, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language explanation.
- After the summary, generate SystemC code that reflects the same behavior.
- In your SystemC code, incorporate the signals defined above.
- Provide the SystemC code in a compilable snippet.

**Inputs**:

* `n`: The integer value in the range `[0, âˆž)` representating the position of the Fibonacci number to compute.

**Outputs**:

* `result`: The computed Fibonacci number at the given position `n`.

**Summary**:

The provided C++/C code computes the Fibonacci sequence using loop-based recursion. The code defines a function `fib` that takes an integer `n` and returns the `n`th Fibonacci number. The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `n` as the result. Otherwise, it initializes two variables `prev1` and `prev2` to 1 and 0, respectively, and sets a variable `curr` to 0.

The function then enters a `for` loop that iterates from 2 to `n`, incrementing `i` by 1 each iteration. Within the loop, the function computes the next Fibonacci number by adding the previous two numbers and updating `prev1` and `prev2` accordingly. Finally, the function returns the computed Fibonacci number at the given position `n`.

In the `main` function, the code calculates the Fibonacci number at position 6 and prints it to the console.

**SystemC Equivalent**:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that computes the nth Fibonacci number
SC_MODULE(Fibonacci) {
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<int> result;

    void fib();

    SC_CTOR(Fibonacci) {
        // Process for computing the Fibonacci sequence
        SC_METHOD(fib);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    void fib() {
        if (n <= 1) {
            result.write(n);
            return;
        }

        int prev1 = 1, prev2 = 0;
        int curr = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            curr = prev1 + prev2;
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = curr;
        }

        result.write(curr);
    }
};
```
In the above SystemC code, the `Fibonacci` module takes input `n` and output `result`, and computes the `n`th Fibonacci number using the same logic as the C++/C code. The module has a single process `fib` that is sensitive to changes in `n` and computes the Fibonacci number when `n` changes. The process first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it writes `n` to `result` and returns. Otherwise, it initializes `prev1`, `prev2`, and `curr` to 1, 0, and 0, respectively, and executes a `for` loop that iterates from 2 to `n`. Within the loop, the process computes the next Fibonacci number by adding the previous two numbers and updating `prev1`, `prev2`, and `curr` accordingly. Finally, the process writes the computed Fibonacci number to `result`.
