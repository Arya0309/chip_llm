  **Inputs:**

* `int arr[]`: An integer array of unsorted elements.
* `int n`: The size of the `arr` array.

**Outputs:**

* `arr[]`: The sorted integer array.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code implements the selection sort algorithm, which is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from an unsorted subarray and moving it to the beginning of the array. The code first declares some functions, `swap`, `selectionSort`, and `printArray`. The `swap` function swaps two elements in the input array, while the `printArray` function prints the contents of the array.

The `selectionSort` function is the main function that implements the selection sort algorithm. It first declares some variables, `i`, `j`, and `min_idx`, then it iterates from index 0 to `n-1` (where `n` is the size of the input array). For each iteration, it finds the minimum element in the unsorted array (from index `i+1` to `n-1`) and swaps it with the element at index `i`.

Finally, the code provides a driver program to test the `selectionSort` function. It declares an input array `arr` with some integer values and passes it to the `selectionSort` function along with its size `n`. The code then prints the sorted array.

**SystemC Code:**

The SystemC code below reflects the same behavior as the original C++/C code. It defines a module called `selectionSort` that has input ports for the integer array `arr` and its size `n`, and an output port for the sorted array. The module also has a method `sort` that performs the selection sort algorithm.
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(selectionSort) {
    sc_in<int> arr[];  // Input array of integers
    sc_in<int> n;  // Size of the input array
    sc_out<int> sortedArr[];  // Output sorted array

    SC_CTOR(selectionSort) {
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << arr << n;
    }

    void sort() {
        int i, j, min_idx;

        // One by one move boundary of unsorted subarray
        for (i = 0; i < n.read(); i++) {
            // Find the minimum element in unsorted array
            min_idx = i;
            for (j = i + 1; j < n.read(); j++) {
                if (arr[j].read() < arr[min_idx].read()) {
                    min_idx = j;
                }
            }

            // Swap the found minimum element with the first element
            int temp = arr[min_idx].read();
            arr[min_idx].write(arr[i].read());
            arr[i].write(temp);
        }

        // Write the sorted array to the output port
        for (i = 0; i < n.read(); i++) {
            sortedArr[i].write(arr[i].read());
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `selectionSort` module has input ports for the integer array `arr` and its size `n`, and an output port for the sorted array. The module also has a method `sort` that performs the selection sort algorithm.

The `sort` method first declares some variables, `i`, `j`, and `min_idx`, then it iterates from index 0 to `n-1` (where `n` is the size of the input array). For each iteration, it finds the minimum element in the unsorted array (from index `i+1` to `n-1`) and swaps it with the element at index `i`.

Finally, the code writes the sorted array to the output port.

Note that this SystemC code utilizes the signals `clk`, `start`, and `done` defined in the provided Signals section. The `clk` signal is used to clock the `sort` method, the `start` signal is used to start the sorting process, and the `done` signal is used to indicate that the sorting process is complete.
