  Inputs:

* `real1`: real part of the first complex number
* `imag1`: imaginary part of the first complex number
* `real2`: real part of the second complex number
* `imag2`: imaginary part of the second complex number

Outputs:

* `real_sum`: real part of the sum of the two complex numbers
* `imag_sum`: imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers

Line-by-Line Summary:

1. Line 14: The `Complex` class is defined with two public variables, `real` and `imaginary`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.
2. Line 17: The constructor for the `Complex` class accepts two arguments: `tempReal` and `tempImaginary`. These are used to initialize the `real` and `imaginary` variables.
3. Line 22: The `addComp` method is defined, which takes two `Complex` objects, `C1` and `C2`, as input.
4. Line 23: The `addComp` method creates a temporary `Complex` object called `temp`.
5. Line 24: The real part of `C1` and `C2` is added and saved in `temp.real`.
6. Line 25: The imaginary part of `C1` and `C2` is added and saved in `temp.imaginary`.
7. Line 26: The `temp` object is returned.
8. Line 30: The first complex number is created with a real part of 3 and an imaginary part of 2.
9. Line 32: The second complex number is created with a real part of 9 and an imaginary part of 5.
10. Line 35: A temporary `Complex` object called `C3` is created, which is used to store the sum.
11. Line 37: The `addComp` method is called with `C1` and `C2` as arguments, and the result is saved in `C3`.
12. Line 40: The real and imaginary parts of `C3` are printed.

SystemC Code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE (ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;
    sc_in<int> imag1;
    sc_in<int> real2;
    sc_in<int> imag2;
    sc_out<int> real_sum;
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;

    void addComplex() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
}
```
In the above SystemC code, we have defined a module called `ComplexAdder` that takes 4 input signals: `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`, and 2 output signals: `real_sum` and `imag_sum`. The module has a single `addComplex` method that adds the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers and writes the result to the output signals.

Note that the input and output signals in the SystemC code are named `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, `real_sum`, and `imag_sum` to match the names used in the provided signals. This is important for seamless integration with our existing testbench.
