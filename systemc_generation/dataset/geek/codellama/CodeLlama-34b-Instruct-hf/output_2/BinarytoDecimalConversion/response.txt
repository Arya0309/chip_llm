  **Inputs:**

* `num`: an integer representing the binary number to be converted.

**Outputs:**

* `dec_value`: an integer representing the decimal equivalent of the input binary number.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code defines a function, `binaryToDecimal`, which takes an integer, `num`, as an input and returns its decimal equivalent as an integer.

The function starts by initializing two variables, `dec_value` and `base`, to 0 and 1, respectively. `base` is used as the power of 2 to compute the decimal equivalent of each digit in the binary number.

The function then iterates over each digit in the input binary number, starting with the least significant digit (rightmost digit). For each digit, it computes the decimal equivalent by multiplying it with the current value of `base` and adds it to `dec_value`.

After iterating over all the digits, the function returns the final value of `dec_value` as the decimal equivalent of the input binary number.

**Equivalent SystemC code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that converts binary to decimal
SC_MODULE(BinaryToDecimal) {
    sc_in<int> binary_in;  // Input port for the binary number
    sc_out<int> decimal_out;  // Output port for the decimal equivalent

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinaryToDecimal) {
        // Process to perform the conversion
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << binary_in;
    }

    // Method to convert the binary number to decimal
    void convert() {
        int dec_value = 0;
        int base = 1;
        int num = binary_in.read();

        while (num) {
            int last_digit = num % 10;
            num = num / 10;
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base = base * 2;
        }

        decimal_out.write(dec_value);
    }
};
```

In this SystemC code, we have defined a module called `BinaryToDecimal` with two ports: `binary_in` for the input binary number and `decimal_out` for the output decimal equivalent. The module also contains a process called `convert` that performs the conversion from binary to decimal.

The process `convert` initializes `dec_value` and `base` to 0 and 1, respectively, and then iterates over each digit in the input binary number. For each digit, it computes the decimal equivalent by multiplying it with the current value of `base` and adds it to `dec_value`. After iterating over all the digits, it writes the final value of `dec_value` to the output port `decimal_out`.

Note that this SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source, and the signals defined above have been incorporated into the code.
