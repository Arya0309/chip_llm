  **Inputs**:

* `mat` is a two-dimensional integer array representing a square matrix.
* `n` is the size of the square matrix.

**Outputs**:

* `trace` is an integer representing the trace of the matrix.
* `norm` is an integer representing the normal of the matrix.

**Code Summary**:

The code consists of two functions: `findTrace()` and `findNormal()`.

1. `findTrace()` takes a two-dimensional integer array `mat` and an integer `n` as inputs, and returns the trace of the matrix.
2. `findNormal()` takes a two-dimensional integer array `mat` and an integer `n` as inputs, and returns the normal of the matrix.
3. The main function declares a two-dimensional integer array `mat` and an integer `n`, and calls the functions `findTrace()` and `findNormal()`.
4. The functions iterate over the matrix elements, calculate the trace and normal, and return the respective values.

**SystemC Code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixOperation) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];
    sc_out<int> trace;
    sc_out<int> norm;
    
    void findTrace() {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                sum += matrix[i][j] * matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        trace.write(sqrt(sum));
    }
    
    void findNormal() {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            sum += matrix[i][i];
        }
        norm.write(sum);
    }
    
    SC_CTOR(MatrixOperation) {
        SC_METHOD(findTrace);
        sensitive << matrix;
        SC_METHOD(findNormal);
        sensitive << matrix;
    }
};

In this SystemC code, we have defined a module `MatrixOperation` that takes a two-dimensional integer array `matrix` as input, and outputs the `trace` and `norm` of the matrix.

The module consists of two methods: `findTrace()` and `findNormal()`. These methods iterate over the matrix elements, calculate the trace and normal, and write the respective values to the output ports `trace` and `norm`.

The module also has a constructor that generates the processes for each method. The constructor reads the input matrix, and triggers the processes for the `findTrace()` and `findNormal()` methods.

In the `findTrace()` method, we have used the same logic as in the original C++/C code to calculate the trace of the matrix. We first initialize the `sum` variable to 0, then iterate over the matrix elements using nested for-loops, and calculate the sum of the elements on the diagonal. Finally, we calculate the trace as the square root of the sum, and write it to the `trace` output port.

In the `findNormal()` method, we have used the same logic as in the original C++/C code to calculate the normal of the matrix. We first initialize the `sum` variable to 0, then iterate over the matrix elements using nested for-loops, and calculate the sum of the elements along the diagonal. Finally, we calculate the normal as the square root of the sum, and write it to the `norm` output port.

Note that we have used the `sensitive` keyword to make the processes sensitive to the inputs in the constructor. This ensures that the processes are triggered whenever the input matrix changes.
