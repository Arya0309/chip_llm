  **Inputs and Outputs**:

* Inputs:
	+ `matrix`: a 2D array of integers representing a matrix
	+ `n`: the size of the matrix (assuming it is a square matrix)
* Outputs:
	+ `principal`: the sum of the elements on the principal diagonal of the matrix
	+ `secondary`: the sum of the elements on the secondary diagonal of the matrix

**Line-by-line summary**:

1. The first `#include` statement includes the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which is a part of the C++ standard library and includes various header files in a single header. The `using namespace std` statement brings all the names in the `std` namespace into the current scope, so that we don't have to use the `std::` prefix for the C++ standard library objects and functions.
2. The `const int MAX` statement declares a constant integer variable `MAX` and initializes it to 100.
3. The `void printDiagonalSums(int mat[][MAX], int n)` function takes a 2D array of integers `mat` and its size `n` as input, and calculates the sum of the elements on the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix.
4. Inside the function, we declare two integer variables `principal` and `secondary` and initialize them to 0.
5. The nested `for` loops iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix, and for each iteration, we check whether the current element is on the principal or secondary diagonal using the if-else condition.
6. If the current element is on the principal diagonal, we add it to the `principal` sum. If it is on the secondary diagonal, we add it to the `secondary` sum.
7. After the loops are completed, we print the values of `principal` and `secondary` to the console.
8. The `main()` function defines a 4x4 matrix `a` and calls the `printDiagonalSums()` function with it and its size 4.

**SystemC code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates the diagonal sums of a matrix
SC_MODULE(DiagonalSums) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE][MAX]; // Input port for the matrix
    sc_in<int> n; // Input port for the size of the matrix
    sc_out<int> principal; // Output port for the principal diagonal sum
    sc_out<int> secondary; // Output port for the secondary diagonal sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSums) {
        // Process to calculate the diagonal sums
        SC_METHOD(calculateSums);
        sensitive << matrix << n;
    }

    // Method to calculate the diagonal sums
    void calculateSums() {
        int principal = 0;
        int secondary = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == j) {
                    principal += matrix[i][j];
                } else if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) {
                    secondary += matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
        }

        principal = matrix[0][0];
        secondary = matrix[0][n - 1];
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we define a module `DiagonalSums` that takes as input a 2D array of integers `matrix` and its size `n`, and produces as output the principal and secondary diagonal sums `principal` and `secondary`.

The `calculateSums()` method is sensitive to changes in `matrix` and `n`, and calculates the diagonal sums by iterating over the rows and columns of the matrix using nested `for` loops. Inside the loops, we check whether the current element is on the principal or secondary diagonal using the if-else condition, and add it to the corresponding sum.

After the loops are completed, we assign the values of the principal and secondary diagonals to the output ports `principal` and `secondary`, respectively.

Note that in the SystemC code, we have used the `sc_in` and `sc_out` data types to define the input and output ports, respectively. These data types are used to model the ports of a SystemC module, and are declared in the `systemc.h` header file.
