  **Inputs:**

* `P`: The principal amount of the investment.
* `R`: The rate of interest as a decimal.
* `T`: The time period of the investment in years.

**Outputs:**

* `SI`: The simple interest calculated as (P \* T \* R) / 100.

**Detailed Explanation:**

The provided C++/C code is a program that computes the simple interest for a given principal amount, time period, and rate of interest. The code follows these steps:

1. Declarations: The program starts by including the `iostream` header file, which provides input/output operations, and the `std` namespace, which contains standard library functions. The next step is to declare the input/output signals and their data types.
2. Driver code: The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It initializes the input signals (`P`, `R`, and `T`) with default values for testing purposes.
3. Calculation: The program calculates the simple interest using the formula (P \* T \* R) / 100. The input values are multiplied, and the result is divided by 100. The result is stored in the `SI` output signal.
4. Output: The program then prints the resultant value of `SI`.

**SystemC Code:**

The following SystemC code preserves the logic of the original C++/C program and utilizes the provided signals:

```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates simple interest
SC_MODULE(InterestCalculator) {
    sc_in<float> P;  // Input port for principal amount
    sc_in<float> R;  // Input port for rate of interest
    sc_in<float> T;  // Input port for time period
    sc_out<float> SI;  // Output port for simple interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(InterestCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate simple interest
        SC_METHOD(calculate);
        sensitive << P << R << T;
    }

    // Method to calculate simple interest
    void calculate() {
        SI.write((P.read() * R.read() * T.read()) / 100);
    }
};
```

In the above code, the `InterestCalculator` module consists of input ports for the principal amount (`P`), rate of interest (`R`), and time period (`T`), and an output port for the simple interest (`SI`). The module has a single method named `calculate` that calculates the simple interest using the formula (P \* T \* R) / 100. The method is sensitive to changes in the input signals, ensuring that the calculation is triggered whenever any of the input signals changes.
