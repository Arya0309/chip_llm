  **Inputs:**

* `octal_input`: Octal value to be converted.

**Outputs:**

* `decimal_output`: Decimal equivalent of the input octal value.

**Natural Language Summary:**

The code takes in an octal input and converts it to its decimal equivalent. The input is first assigned to a variable `num` and then a function `octalToDecimal` is called to perform the conversion.

The `octalToDecimal` function takes the input and stores it in a variable `n`. The function then initializes a variable `dec_value` to 0, which will be used to store the decimal equivalent of the input.

The function then initializes a variable `base` to 1, which will be used to represent the base value for the octal number (i.e., 8^0).

The function then uses a loop to extract the last digit of the input number and multiply it with the appropriate base value, which is obtained by multiplying the current base value by 8. The result is then added to the `dec_value` variable.

The function then increments the base value and repeats the process until all digits of the input number are processed.

Finally, the function returns the `dec_value` variable, which contains the decimal equivalent of the input octal number.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(OctalToDecimal) {
    // Input port for the octal value
    sc_in<int> octal_input;

    // Output port for the decimal equivalent
    sc_out<int> decimal_output;

    SC_CTOR(OctalToDecimal) {
        // Process to convert octal to decimal
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << octal_input;
    }

    void convert() {
        int num = octal_input.read();
        int dec_value = 0;
        int base = 1;

        while (num) {
            int last_digit = num % 10;
            num /= 10;
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base *= 8;
        }

        decimal_output.write(dec_value);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined an `OctalToDecimal` module that takes in an octal input and outputs the decimal equivalent. The `convert` method is responsible for converting the input octal value to decimal.

The method first initializes two variables, `num` and `dec_value`, to the input value and 0, respectively. It then initializes a variable `base` to 1, which will represent the base value for the octal number.

The method then uses a loop to extract the last digit of the input number and multiply it with the appropriate base value, which is obtained by multiplying the current base value by 8. The result is then added to the `dec_value` variable.

The method then increments the base value and repeats the process until all digits of the input number are processed.

Finally, the method writes the decimal equivalent of the input octal number to the `decimal_output` port.
