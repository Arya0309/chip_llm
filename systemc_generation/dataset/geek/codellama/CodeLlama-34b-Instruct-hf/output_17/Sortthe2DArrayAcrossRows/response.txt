  **Inputs and Outputs**:

* The C++/C code takes two inputs:
	+ `m[][4]`: a 2D matrix of integers.
	+ `r` and `c`: the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.
* The code has one output:
	+ The sorted matrix `m[][4]`.

**Code Explanation**:

1. The first section of the code declares the `swap` function, which swaps the values of two integers.
2. The `sortRowWise` function takes the matrix and its dimensions as inputs and sorts the rows of the matrix in ascending order.
	* The function loops through each row of the matrix.
	* For each row, it loops through each column, starting from the leftmost column.
	* For each column, it compares the current element with the one on its right and swaps them if the current element is greater.
	* The sorting continues until the rightmost column is reached.
3. The `main` function is the driver code that tests the `sortRowWise` function.
	* It declares a 2D matrix `m[][4]` with some initial values.
	* It calculates the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
	* It calls the `sortRowWise` function with the matrix and its dimensions as inputs.
	* It prints the sorted matrix.

**SystemC Code**:

The following SystemC code performs the same logic as the C++/C code, using the same inputs and outputs.

```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that sorts a 2D matrix row-wise
SC_MODULE(SortRowWise) {
    // Inputs:
    sc_in<int> m[4][4];   // 2D array of integers as input
    sc_in<int> r, c;   // Number of rows and columns in the matrix as input

    // Outputs:
    sc_out<int> sorted[4][4];   // Sorted 2D array of integers as output

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SortRowWise) {
        // Process to swap elements
        SC_METHOD(swap);
        sensitive << m;
    }

    // Method to perform the sort
    void sort() {
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k < c - j - 1; k++) {
                    if (m[i][k] > m[i][k + 1]) {
                        swap(m[i][k], m[i][k + 1]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Method to swap elements
    void swap(int *xp, int *yp) {
        int temp = *xp;
        *xp = *yp;
        *yp = temp;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `SortRowWise` module takes an input matrix `m[][4]`, the number of rows `r`, and the number of columns `c` as inputs. It has an output matrix `sorted[][4]`. The `sort()` method swaps elements in the input matrix to sort the rows in ascending order. The `swap()` method swaps the values of two integers.

Note that the `SortRowWise` module uses the same signals as the C++/C code: `r`, `c`, and `m[][4]`. This ensures that the SystemC code can seamlessly integrate with our existing testbench.
