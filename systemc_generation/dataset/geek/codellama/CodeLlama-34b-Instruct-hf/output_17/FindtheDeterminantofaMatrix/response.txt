  **Inputs:**

* `n`: The size of the square matrix `a`
* `a`: The square matrix to be used for computing the determinant

**Outputs:**

* `det`: The determinant of the matrix `a`

**Summary:**

The given C++/C code is a program that computes the determinant of a square matrix using the Gauss-Jordan elimination method. The program first defines the size of the matrix `a` as `n`, and then initializes the matrix `a` with the given values. Then, it calls the function `determinant(n)` to compute the determinant of the matrix. The function `determinant(n)` is implemented as a recursive function that uses Gauss-Jordan elimination method to compute the determinant of the matrix. The function starts by finding the pivot element in the first column of the matrix, and then swaps the pivot element with the element in the first row and the first column if the pivot is not already in the first row. Then, it computes the determinant of the matrix by recursively calling the function on the submatrix obtained by removing the first row and column of the original matrix. Finally, the function returns the determinant of the matrix.

The main function of the program is used to test the `determinant(n)` function by calling it with the given matrix `a` and printing the result to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that computes the determinant of a square matrix
SC_MODULE(Determinant) {
    sc_in<double>* a;  // Input port for the matrix
    sc_out<double> det; // Output port for the determinant

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Determinant) {
        // Process to compute the determinant
        SC_METHOD(compute_determinant);
        sensitive << a;
    }

    // Method to compute the determinant
    void compute_determinant() {
        // Declare variables
        double det = 1.0;
        double pivot;
        int n = a.size();

        // Loop through each row of the matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Find the pivot element in the current row
            pivot = a[i][i];
            // Swap the pivot element with the element in the first column if it is not already there
            if (pivot != a[i][0]) {
                swap(a[i][0], a[i][i]);
                det *= -1;
            }
            // Compute the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing the first row and column of the original matrix
            double sub_det = determinant(n - 1, a);
            // Multiply the determinant of the submatrix by the pivot element
            det *= sub_det;
        }
        // Return the determinant of the matrix
        det.write(det);
    }
