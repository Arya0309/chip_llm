  **Inputs and Outputs:**

The C++/C code provided as input has one input, `n`, which is a 32-bit integer. The output is a string that indicates whether the number is even or odd.

**Line-by-Line Analysis:**

1. The first line is a comment that explains the purpose of the code.
2. The second line includes the header file `bits/stdc++.h`, which provides the standard library for C++.
3. The third line brings the `std` namespace into the current scope.
4. The fourth line defines the `main` function, which is the entry point for the program.
5. The fifth line defines an integer variable named `n` and initializes it to 11.
6. The sixth line uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if `n` is evenly divisible by 2. If the result is 0, then `n` is even; otherwise, it is odd.
7. The seventh line prints the appropriate message to the console based on the result of the modulo operation.
8. The eighth line returns 0 to indicate that the program ran successfully.

**SystemC Code:**

The following SystemC code snippet implements the same logic as the C++/C code, using the `number_in` and `result_out` ports defined in the provided signals:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks if a number is even or odd
SC_MODULE(EvenOdd) {
    sc_in<int> number_in;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<int> result_out;  // Output port for the result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(EvenOdd) {
        // Process to check if the number is even
        SC_METHOD(check_even);
        sensitive << number_in;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is even
    void check_even() {
        // Use modulo operator to check if the number is evenly divisible by 2
        if (number_in.read() % 2 == 0) {
            result_out.write(1);  // Even
        } else {
            result_out.write(0);  // Odd
        }
    }
};
```
In this code, the `number_in` input port receives the number to be checked, and the `result_out` output port indicates whether the number is even or odd. The `check_even` method uses the modulo operator to determine if the number is evenly divisible by 2. If the result is 0, then the number is even; otherwise, it is odd. The `check_even` method is triggered whenever the `number_in` input port changes value.
