  **Inputs and Outputs:**

* Input: Two matrices, mat1 and mat2, of sizes R1xC1 and R2xC2 respectively.
* Output: The product matrix, rslt, of size R1xC2.

**Code Summary:**

The code defines two functions: `mulMat` and `main`.

The `mulMat` function takes two matrices as input and computes their product. It first initializes the product matrix, rslt, to zero, and then iterates over the rows and columns of the matrices. Inside each iteration, it calculates the dot product of the row of the first matrix with the column of the second matrix and stores the result in the corresponding position of the product matrix.

The `main` function is the driver code that initializes the matrices and calls the `mulMat` function. It also checks that the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix, as required for matrix multiplication.

**SystemC Code Snippet:**

Here is a SystemC code snippet that implements the same behavior as the C++/C code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that multiplies two matrices
SC_MODULE(MatMul) {
    sc_in<int> mat1[SIZE_A][SIZE_B];  // Input port for matrix 1
    sc_in<int> mat2[SIZE_A][SIZE_B];  // Input port for matrix 2
    sc_out<int> rslt[SIZE_RESULT][SIZE_B]; // Output port for product matrix

    // Construction
    SC_CTOR(MatMul) {
        // Process to perform matrix multiplication
        SC_METHOD(mul);
        sensitive << mat1 << mat2;
    }

    // Method to multiply the matrices
    void mul() {
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE_RESULT; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE_B; j++) {
                rslt[i][j] = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < SIZE_A; k++) {
                    rslt[i][j] += mat1[i][k] * mat2[k][j];
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In this code, we define a module called `MatMul` that takes two matrices as input and outputs the product matrix. We use two-dimensional arrays to represent the matrices, with sizes specified by the global constants `SIZE_A`, `SIZE_B`, and `SIZE_RESULT`. The multiplication is performed inside the `mul` method, which is triggered by changes to either input matrix.

Note that this code snippet assumes that the matrices are of fixed size, as specified by the global constants. If the matrices have different sizes, the code would need to be modified accordingly.
