  **Inputs:**

* `A`: A string representing a binary number.
* `B`: A string representing a binary number.

**Outputs:**

* `sum`: A string representing the sum of `A` and `B` in binary format.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code defines a function `addBinary` that takes two binary strings `A` and `B` as inputs and returns the sum of `A` and `B` as a string. The function first checks if the length of `A` is greater than the length of `B`, and if so, it swaps the two strings and calls the function again to preserve the original behavior of the code.

The function then calculates the difference in length between the two strings and adds leading zeros to the shorter string to make it the same length as the longer string. It then iterates over the longer string and calculates the sum digit by digit, using a carry flag to track any overflow. Finally, it reverses the result string and returns it.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two binary strings
SC_MODULE(BinaryAdder) {
    sc_in<std::string> A;  // Input port for the first binary string
    sc_in<std::string> B;  // Input port for the second binary string
    sc_out<std::string> sum;  // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinaryAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << A << B;
    }

    // Method to add the two binary strings
    void add() {
        std::string result;
        int carry = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length(); i++) {
            if (A[i] == '1' && B[i] == '1') {
                result.push_back('1');
                carry = 1;
            } else if (A[i] == '0' && B[i] == '0') {
                result.push_back('0');
                carry = 0;
            } else if (A[i] != B[i]) {
                result.push_back('1');
                carry = 1;
            }
        }
        if (carry == 1) {
            result.push_back('1');
        }
        sum.write(result);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `BinaryAdder` that takes two input ports `A` and `B` and an output port `sum`. The module contains a method called `add` that performs the addition of `A` and `B` and writes the result to the output port `sum`. The method iterates over each bit of the longer string (either `A` or `B`) and calculates the sum digit by digit, using a carry flag to track any overflow. Finally, it appends the carry flag to the result string and writes it to the output port.

The code also includes a constructor that initializes the process for the addition.
