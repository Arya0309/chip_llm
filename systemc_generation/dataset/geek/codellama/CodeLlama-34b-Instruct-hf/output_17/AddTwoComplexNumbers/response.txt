  **Inputs**:

* `real1`: Real part of the first complex number
* `imag1`: Imaginary part of the first complex number
* `real2`: Real part of the second complex number
* `imag2`: Imaginary part of the second complex number

**Outputs**:

* `real_sum`: Real part of the sum of the two complex numbers
* `imag_sum`: Imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers

**Summary**:

The code provided is a C++ implementation of a class for complex numbers and a main function that tests the class. The class definition includes two member variables, `real` and `imaginary`, to represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. The class also includes a constructor that takes in two integers, `tempReal` and `tempImaginary`, and assigns their values to the `real` and `imaginary` member variables, respectively.

The class also includes a method called `addComp()` that takes in two complex numbers, `C1` and `C2`, and returns a new complex number that represents the sum of the two inputs. The method first creates a new complex number, `temp`, and then sets its `real` and `imaginary` values to the sum of the corresponding values of `C1` and `C2`. The method then returns `temp`.

In the driver code, two complex numbers are created, `C1` and `C2`, and their real and imaginary parts are printed to the console. A new complex number, `C3`, is then created and its `real` and `imaginary` values are set to the sum of the corresponding values of `C1` and `C2` using the `addComp()` method. The real and imaginary parts of `C3` are then printed to the console.

**SystemC Code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for the real part of the first number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the first number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for the real part of the second number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for the imaginary part of the second number
    sc_out<int> real_sum; // Output port for the real part of the sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum; // Output port for the imaginary part of the sum

    // Constructor
    ComplexAdder(sc_module_name name) : sc_module(name)
    {
        SC_METHOD(addComp);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void addComp()
    {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `ComplexAdder` that includes input ports for the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers being added, as well as output ports for the real and imaginary parts of the sum. The constructor for the module includes `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2` as sensitivity lists, so that the `addComp()` method is called whenever any of these variables change.

The `addComp()` method first reads the values of `real1`, `real2`, `imag1`, and `imag2` from their corresponding input ports, and then calculates the sum of the real and imaginary parts using the same formula as the `addComp()` method in the C++ code. The real and imaginary parts of the sum are then written to the output ports, `real_sum` and `imag_sum`, respectively.
