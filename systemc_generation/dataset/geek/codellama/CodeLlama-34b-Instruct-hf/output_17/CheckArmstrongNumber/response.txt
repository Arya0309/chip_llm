  **Inputs:**

* `n`: An integer value representing the user input.

**Outputs:**

* `p`: An integer value representing the sum of the individual digits of the user input.
* Console output indicating whether the user input is an Armstrong number or not.

**Major lines/blocks and their functionality:**

* `temp = n;`: The temporary variable `temp` is assigned the value of `n`.
* `while (n > 0) { ... }`: This is the main loop of the program. It repeatedly takes the last digit of `n` and calculates its cube. The cube is then added to `p`, and `n` is shortened by one digit. This process is repeated until `n` is equal to zero.
* `int rem = n % 10;`: This line of code calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by 10. This remainder is the last digit of `n`.
* `p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);`: This line of code calculates the cube of the last digit of `n` and adds it to the previous value of `p`.
* `n = n / 10;`: This line of code shortens `n` by one digit by dividing it by 10.
* `if (temp == p) { ... }`: This line of code checks whether the value of `p` is equal to the original user input `temp`. If they are equal, then the user input is an Armstrong number.

**Equivalent SystemC code:**
```
void armstrong() {
    integer n;
    n = num_in.read();

    integer p = 0;
    integer temp = n;

    while (n > 0) {
        integer rem = n % 10;
        p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
        n = n / 10;
    }

    if (temp == p) {
        cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
	is_armstrong.write(true);
    } else {
        cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
	is_armstrong.write(false);
    }
}
```
The SystemC code above receives the user input `n` from the `num_in` signal and stores it in the variable `n`. It then initializes the variable `p` to zero and copies the input `n` to `temp`. The next while loop repeatedly calculates the sum of the individual digits of `n` by taking the last digit, cubing it, and adding it to `p`. After that, it shortens `n` by one digit using integer division. The while loop continues until `n` is equal to zero. Finally, the code checks whether the value of `p` is equal to `temp` and outputs the appropriate message to the console as well as writes the boolean value to the `is_armstrong` signal indicating whether the input was an Armstrong number or not.
