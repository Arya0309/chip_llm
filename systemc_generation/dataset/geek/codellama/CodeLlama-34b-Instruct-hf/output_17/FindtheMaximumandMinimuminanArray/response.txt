  **Inputs:**

* `arr`: An array of integers for which the minimum and maximum values will be found.
* `n`: The size of the array `arr`.

**Outputs:**

* `min_val`: The minimum value in the array `arr`.
* `max_val`: The maximum value in the array `arr`.

**Line-by-Line Natural Language Summary:**

The code defines two functions `getMin` and `getMax` that take an array of integers and its size as input and return the minimum and maximum values in the array, respectively.

The `getMin` function uses the `min_element` function from the `<algorithm>` header file to find the minimum element in the array. The `min_element` function returns an iterator that points to the first minimum element in the range `[arr, arr + n)`. The `getMin` function then dereferences this iterator to obtain the minimum value.

Similarly, the `getMax` function uses the `max_element` function to find the maximum element in the range `[arr, arr + n)`. This function also returns an iterator that points to the first maximum element in the range, and the `getMax` function dereferences this iterator to obtain the maximum value.

The `main` function declares an array of integers, `arr`, and its size, `n`, and then calls the `getMin` and `getMax` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the array. The results are then printed to the console using `cout`.

**Equivalent SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include "systemc.h"

SC_MODULE(MinMaxFinder) {
    sc_in<int> arr[];
    sc_out<int> min_val;
    sc_out<int> max_val;

    SC_CTOR(MinMaxFinder) {
        // Process to find the minimum and maximum values
        SC_METHOD(findMinAndMax);
        sensitive << arr;
    }

    void findMinAndMax() {
        int n = arr.size();
        int min_val = min_element(arr, arr + n);
        int max_val = max_element(arr, arr + n);
        min_val.write(min_val);
        max_val.write(max_val);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `MinMaxFinder` module has two input ports `arr` and `n`, and two output ports `min_val` and `max_val`. The `arr` port is connected to the input array, and the `n` port is connected to the size of the input array. The `min_val` and `max_val` ports are connected to the output ports of the `findMinAndMax` method, which computes the minimum and maximum values in the input array.

The `findMinAndMax` method uses the `min_element` and `max_element` functions from the `<algorithm>` header file to find the minimum and maximum elements in the range `[arr, arr + n)`. These functions return iterators that point to the first minimum and maximum elements in the range. The method then dereferences these iterators to obtain the minimum and maximum values.

The method writes the `min_val` and `max_val` outputs to the corresponding ports using the `write` method.

The SystemC code can be used in a high-level synthesis flow to generate a hardware component that finds the minimum and maximum values in an input array. The `clk` and `start` signals from the testbench can be used to reset the component and start the search, respectively. The `done` signal from the testbench can be used to indicate when the search is complete, and the `min_val` and `max_val` signals from the testbench can be used to check the results of the search.
