  * Inputs:
	+ P: The principal amount of the investment.
	+ R: The interest rate as a decimal.
	+ T: The time period of the investment.
* Output:
	+ SI: The simple interest calculated using the formula: (P \* T \* R) / 100.

* Line-by-line explanation:
	+ `#include<iostream>`: This line includes the iostream library, which provides the necessary functions for input and output operations.
	+ `using namespace std;`: This line declares that the standard namespace will be used.
	+ `float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1;`: These lines declare and initialize the input variables in the scope of the main function. The values are initialized to 1 for testing purpose.
	+ `float SI = (P * T * R) / 100;`: This line calculates the simple interest using the formula (P \* T \* R) / 100. The result is stored in the variable SI.
	+ `cout << "Simple Interest = " << SI;`: This line prints the result of the calculation to the console.
	+ `return 0;`: This line ends the main function and returns an integer value of 0 to indicate successful execution.

* SystemC code snippet:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SimpleInterest) {
  sc_in<float> P; // input port for principal amount
  sc_in<float> R; // input port for interest rate
  sc_in<float> T; // input port for time period
  sc_out<float> SI; // output port for simple interest

  SC_METHOD(computeInterest) {
    SI.write((P.read() * T.read() * R.read()) / 100);
  }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we've defined a module `SimpleInterest` that has input ports for the principal amount, interest rate, and time period. The module also has an output port for the simple interest. The `computeInterest` method is responsible for calculating the simple interest using the formula (P \* T \* R) / 100 and storing the result in the output port `SI`.

Note that the names of the ports have been preserved in the SystemC code to ensure compatibility with the testbench.
