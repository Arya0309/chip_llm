  The C++/C code you provided is a program that takes a 2D integer array as input and calculates the trace and normal of the matrix. The arrays rows and columns are assumed to be equal to `SIZE`, which is defined as 100.

The program first defines two functions: `findTrace` and `findNormal`, which are responsible for calculating the trace and normal of the input matrix, respectively. The functions take the matrix and its size as input and return the corresponding metric as an `int` value.

The program then defines the `main` function, which is the entry point for the program. In the `main` function, a 2D integer array is defined and initialized with 5 rows and 5 columns. The values of the array elements are not important, as the program only reads them to calculate the trace and normal.

After the initialization of the input array, the program calls the two functions `findTrace` and `findNormal` passing the input array and its size as arguments. The results of these functions are then printed to the console using `cout`.

After analysis, the line-by-line explanation of the code is as follows:

1. The program starts by defining two functions: `findTrace` and `findNormal`. These functions are declared before the `main` function, which is the entry point for the program.
2. The `findTrace` function takes an integer array and its size as input and returns the trace of the matrix as an integer value. The function first initializes a local integer variable `sum` to 0.
3. Then, the function uses two nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the input matrix. For each row and column, the function multiplies the element at the corresponding position with itself and adds the result to the `sum` variable.
4. After the loops are finished, the function takes the square root of the `sum` variable and returns the value as the trace of the matrix.
5. The `findNormal` function is similar to the `findTrace` function, but it calculates the normal of the matrix instead of the trace. Instead of multiplying the elements with themselves, the function uses the absolute value of each element.
6. The program then defines the `main` function, which is the entry point for the program. In the `main` function, a 2D integer array is defined and initialized with 5 rows and 5 columns.
7. The program then calls the `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions, passing the input array and its size as arguments. The results of these functions are then printed to the console using `cout`.

Based on the above analysis, the equivalent SystemC code would be:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixCalculator)
{
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE][SIZE]; // Input matrix
    sc_out<int> trace; // Output trace
    sc_out<int> norm; // Output normal

    void findTrace()
    {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                sum += matrix[i][j] * matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        trace.write(sqrt(sum));
    }

    void findNormal()
    {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                sum += abs(matrix[i][j]);
            }
        }
        norm.write(sqrt(sum));
    }

    SC_CTOR(MatrixCalculator) {
        sensitive << matrix << trace << norm;
    }
};
```
Note that in the SystemC code, we have declared two output ports `trace` and `norm`, which will be connected to the testbench. The `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions are member functions of the `MatrixCalculator` module, which will be executed according to the sensitivity list. The `findTrace` function calculates the trace of the input matrix and writes the result to the `trace` port. The `findNormal` function calculates the normal of the input matrix and writes the result to the `norm` port.
