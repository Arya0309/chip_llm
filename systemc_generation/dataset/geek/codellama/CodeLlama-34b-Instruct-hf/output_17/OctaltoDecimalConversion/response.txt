  **Inputs**:

* `octal_input`: An integer representing the octal number to be converted.

**Outputs**:

* `decimal_output`: An integer representing the decimal equivalent of the input octal number.

**Summary**:

The provided C++ code defines a function `octalToDecimal` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the decimal equivalent of the input octal number. The function works by iterating through the digits of the input octal number, extracting the last digit, multiplying it with the appropriate base value (which is 8 in this case), and adding it to the decimal value. The base value is updated after each iteration to reflect the fact that we are working with an octal number.

Here's a line-by-line explanation of the code:

1. `int num = n;`: This line declares an integer variable `num` and initializes it to the value of the input integer `n`.
2. `int dec_value = 0;`: This line declares an integer variable `dec_value` and initializes it to 0.
3. `int base = 1;`: This line declares an integer variable `base` and initializes it to 1. The value of `base` will be updated after each iteration to reflect the fact that we are working with an octal number.
4. `int temp = num;`: This line declares an integer variable `temp` and initializes it to the value of `num`.
5. `while (temp) {...}`: This line begins a loop that will iterate until the value of `temp` is 0.
6. `int last_digit = temp % 10;`: This line extracts the last digit of the input octal number by using the modulo operator (%). For example, if the input octal number is 67, the last digit is 7.
7. `temp = temp / 10;`: This line updates the value of `temp` by dividing it by 10. This is done to eliminate the last digit that was extracted in the previous line.
8. `dec_value += last_digit * base;`: This line updates the value of `dec_value` by adding the last digit of the input octal number multiplied by the appropriate base value. The base value is updated after each iteration to reflect the fact that we are working with an octal number.
9. `base = base * 8;`: This line updates the value of `base` by multiplying it by 8.
10. `return dec_value;`: This line returns the final decimal value, which is the sum of all the octal digits multiplied by their appropriate base value.

**SystemC Code**:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(OctalToDecimal) {
    // Input port for the octal number
    sc_in<int> octal_input;
    
    // Output port for the decimal value
    sc_out<int> decimal_output;
    
    // Decimal value
    int dec_value = 0;
    
    // Base value
    int base = 1;

    // Process to convert octal to decimal
    SC_CTOR(OctalToDecimal) {
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << octal_input;
    }

    // Method to convert the octal number to decimal
    void convert() {
        int temp = octal_input.read();
        while (temp) {
            int last_digit = temp % 10;
            temp = temp / 10;
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base = base * 8;
        }
        decimal_output.write(dec_value);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `OctalToDecimal` that has two ports: `octal_input` and `decimal_output`. The `octal_input` port is used to input the octal number, and the `decimal_output` port is used to output the decimal equivalent of the input octal number.

The `convert` method is a process that converts the input octal number to decimal. It works by iterating through the digits of the input octal number, extracting the last digit, multiplying it with the appropriate base value, and adding it to the decimal value. The base value is updated after each iteration to reflect the fact that we are working with an octal number. Finally, the decimal value is output through the `decimal_output` port.

The `OctalToDecimal` module can be used in a high-level synthesis flow by instantiating it in a SystemC design and connecting its ports to other modules or signals. For example:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    unsigned int octal_input = 67;
    int decimal_output;

    OctalToDecimal octal_to_decimal("octal_to_decimal");
    octal_to_decimal.octal_input.write(octal_input);
    decimal_output = octal_to_decimal.decimal_output.read();

    cout << "Octal input: " << octal_input << endl;
    cout << "Decimal output: " << decimal_output << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we instantiate an `OctalToDecimal` module and connect its `octal_input` port to the `octal_input` signal, and its `decimal_output` port to the `decimal_output` signal. We then drive the `octal_input` signal with the value 67, and read the `decimal_output` signal to get the decimal equivalent of 67. Finally, we print the results to the console.
