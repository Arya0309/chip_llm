  **Inputs:**

* `mat[][MAX]`: a 2D array of integers representing the input matrix.
* `n`: the size of the `mat` array.

**Outputs:**

* `principal`: the sum of the principal diagonal of the input matrix.
* `secondary`: the sum of the secondary diagonal of the input matrix.

**C++/C Code Analysis:**

The program defines a function `printDiagonalSums()` that takes a 2D array of integers and its size as input. The function first initializes two variables, `principal` and `secondary`, to 0. It then performs a nested iteration through the `mat` array using two `for` loops.

In the inner loop, the function checks whether the current element is on the principal diagonal using the condition `i == j`. If this is the case, the function adds the current element to the `principal` variable.

Similarly, the function checks whether the current element is on the secondary diagonal using the condition `(i + j) == (n - 1)`. If this is the case, the function adds the current element to the `secondary` variable.

Finally, the function prints the values of `principal` and `secondary` to the console.

**SystemC Code Generation:**

The proposed SystemC code for the program above can be generated as follows:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSum) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];
    sc_out<int> principal;
    sc_out<int> secondary;

    void calculateDiagonalSums() {
        int principal = 0, secondary = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                if (i == j) {
                    principal += matrix[i][j];
                }
                if ((i + j) == (SIZE - 1)) {
                    secondary += matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        principal.write(principal);
        secondary.write(secondary);
    }
};
```
In this code, we define a `DiagonalSum` module that takes the input matrix `matrix` and two output ports `principal` and `secondary`. The module has a single method, `calculateDiagonalSums()`, which implements the logic of the original C++/C program.

In the method, we first initialize the `principal` and `secondary` variables to 0. We then perform a nested iteration through the input matrix using two `for` loops, similar to the original C++/C program.

In the inner loop, we check whether the current element is on the principal diagonal using the condition `i == j`. If this is the case, we add the current element to the `principal` variable. We also check whether the current element is on the secondary diagonal using the condition `(i + j) == (SIZE - 1)`. If this is the case, we add the current element to the `secondary` variable.

Finally, we write the values of `principal` and `secondary` to the output ports, which are of type `sc_out<int>`.

Note that this SystemC code can be used in a high-level synthesis flow to generate a hardware circuit that implements the logic of the original C++/C program.
