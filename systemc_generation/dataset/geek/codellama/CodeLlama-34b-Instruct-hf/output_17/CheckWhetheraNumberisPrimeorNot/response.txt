  **Inputs:**

* `n`: An integer

**Outputs:**

* `is_prime`: A boolean indicating whether `n` is prime or not

**Line-by-line explanation:**

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This line includes the standard C++ header files.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line tells the compiler to use the standard C++ namespace.
3. `int main() {`: This line begins the `main` function, which is the entry point for the program.
4. `int n = 29;`: This line declares and initializes the variable `n` to the value `29`.
5. `int cnt = 0;`: This line declares and initializes the variable `cnt` to the value `0`.
6. `if (n <= 1) {`: This line checks if `n` is less than or equal to `1`. If it is, the program will execute the code inside the body of the `if` statement.
7. `cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;`: This line outputs a message saying that `n` is not prime. The `<<` operator is used to concatenate the text and the value of `n`. The `endl` statement outputs a newline character.
8. `else {`: This line begins an `else` statement, which will be executed if the condition in the preceding `if` statement is false.
9. `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {`: This line begins a `for` loop that will iterate from `1` to `n`.
10. `if (n % i == 0) {`: This line checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, the program will execute the code inside the body of the `if` statement.
11. `cnt++;`: This line increments the value of `cnt` by `1`.
12. `}`: This line ends the body of the `if` statement.
13. `}`: This line ends the `for` loop.
14. `if (cnt > 2) {`: This line checks if `cnt` is greater than `2`. If it is, the program will execute the code inside the body of the `if` statement.
15. `cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;`: This line outputs a message saying that `n` is not prime.
16. `else {`: This line begins an `else` statement, which will be executed if the condition in the preceding `if` statement is false.
17. `cout << n << " is prime" << endl;`: This line outputs a message saying that `n` is prime.
18. `}`: This line ends the `main` function.

**SystemC code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks if a number is prime
SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n;  // Input port for the number to check
    sc_out<bool> is_prime; // Output port for the result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        // Process to perform the check
        SC_METHOD(check);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to check if the number is prime
    void check() {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        is_prime.write(cnt > 2);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `PrimeChecker` that takes an integer input `n` and produces a boolean output `is_prime`. The `check` method is the principal method of the module, and it checks if `n` is prime by looping through the numbers from `1` to `n` and counting how many numbers `n` is divisible by. If `n` is divisible by more than two numbers, it is not prime, and the `is_prime` output is set to `false`. Otherwise, `n` is prime, and the `is_prime` output is set to `true`.

The `PrimeChecker` module is connected to the `n` input and the `is_prime` output using the `sensitive` keyword, which tells SystemC that these signals need to be monitored in order to trigger the `check` method. When the value of `n` changes, the `check` method will automatically be called.
