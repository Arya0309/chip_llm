  **Inputs:**

* `a`: The first number to be swapped.
* `b`: The second number to be swapped.

**Outputs:**

* `a`: The second number after the swap.
* `b`: The first number after the swap.

**Line-by-line explanation**:

1. `int a = 2, b = 3;`: Initialize variables `a` and `b` with values 2 and 3, respectively.
2. `cout << "Before swapping a = " << a << " , b = " << b << endl;`: Display the values of `a` and `b` before swapping.
3. `int temp;`: Declare a temporary variable `temp`.
4. `temp = a;`: Assign the value of `a` to `temp`.
5. `a = b;`: Assign the value of `b` to `a`.
6. `b = temp;`: Assign the value of `temp` to `b`.
7. `cout << "After swapping a = " << a << " , b = " << b << endl;`: Display the values of `a` and `b` after swapping.

**SystemC implementation**:

Here is a SystemC implementation of the C++/C code that utilizes the provided signals:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Swapper) {
    sc_in<int> a;   // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;   // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> out_a;  // Output port for the first number after swapping
    sc_out<int> out_b;  // Output port for the second number after swapping

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Swapper) {
        // Process to perform swapping
        SC_THREAD(swap);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to swap the two numbers
    void swap() {
        int temp;
        temp = a.read();
        a.write(b.read());
        b.write(temp);
    }
};
```
In this implementation, the `Swapper` module has input ports `a` and `b` for the two numbers to be swapped, and output ports `out_a` and `out_b` for the two numbers after swapping. The constructor declares a process called `swap` that performs the swapping operation. The `swap` method reads the values of `a` and `b`, assigns the values of `a` and `b` to `temp`, and then assigns the values of `b` and `temp` to `a` and `b`, respectively. The process is sensitive to changes in `a` and `b`, and it is executed whenever one of these inputs changes.
