  **Inputs**:

* `a`: An integer provided as input via the signal `sc_in<int> a`
* `b`: An integer provided as input via the signal `sc_in<int> b`

**Outputs**:

* `lcm_result`: The least common multiple of `a` and `b`, which is provided as output via the signal `sc_out<int> lcm_result`.

**Code Summary**:

1. The first step in the code is to determine which of `a` and `b` is the larger number. This is done using the ternary operator, which assigns the larger number to the variable `max_num`.
2. Once `max_num` is determined, the code enters a while loop that continues until a common multiple of `a` and `b` is found.
3. Inside the while loop, the code checks to see if `max_num` is a multiple of both `a` and `b`. If it is, the least common multiple is found and the program prints a message to the console indicating the LCM.
4. If `max_num` is not a multiple of both `a` and `b`, the loop variable is incremented and the process repeats until a common multiple is found.

**Equivalent SystemC Code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that finds the least common multiple of two integers
SC_MODULE(LeastCommonMultiple) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> lcm_result; // Output port for the least common multiple

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LeastCommonMultiple) {
        // Process to find the least common multiple
        SC_METHOD(find_lcm);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to find the least common multiple
    void find_lcm() {
        int max_num;
        int flag = 1;

        // Use ternary operator to get the larger number
        max_num = (a > b) ? a : b;

        while (flag) {
            if (max_num % a == 0 && max_num % b == 0) {
                lcm_result.write(max_num);
                break;
            }

            // update by 1 on each iteration
            max_num++;
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `LeastCommonMultiple` module takes two input ports `a` and `b`, and an output port `lcm_result`. The `find_lcm` method is triggered whenever either `a` or `b` changes, and it computes the least common multiple of `a` and `b` using the same logic as the original C++ code. Once the least common multiple is found, it is stored in the `lcm_result` output port.
