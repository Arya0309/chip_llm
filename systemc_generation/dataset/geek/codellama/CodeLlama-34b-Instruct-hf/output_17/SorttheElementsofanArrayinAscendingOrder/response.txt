  The provided C++/C code is a sorting algorithm that takes an integer array and its length as input and sorts the array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The output of the code is the sorted array.

The code starts by defining a `sort` function that takes the array and its length as input and performs the sorting operation. The `sort` function is called from the `main` function with the initialized array `nums` and its length `size_nums`.

The `sort` function is implemented using a bubble sort algorithm, which iterates through the array `n-1` times, where `n` is the length of the array. In each iteration, the maximum element in the array is swapped with the element at the last index. The algorithm continues until no swaps are made, indicating that the array is sorted.

The `sort` function also declares a boolean variable `isSwapped` to track whether any swaps have been made in the current iteration. If `isSwapped` is set to `true`, it means that the array is not sorted yet, and the algorithm should continue iterating. If `isSwapped` is set to `false`, it means that the array is sorted, and the algorithm should stop iterating.

The `swapNums` function is used in the `sort` function to swap two elements in the array. It takes the array, the index of the first element to be swapped, and the index of the second element to be swapped.

The `main` function is the driver code that initializes the array `nums` and its length `size_nums`, prints the array before and after sorting, and calls the `sort` function.

Here's a line-by-line explanation of the C++/C code:

1. The `sort` function is defined to take an integer array and its length as input and returns nothing.
2. The function iterates through the array `n-1` times, where `n` is the length of the array.
3. In each iteration, the maximum element in the array is swapped with the element at the last index.
4. The algorithm continues until no swaps are made, indicating that the array is sorted.
5. The `swapNums` function is used to swap two elements in the array.
6. The `main` function is the driver code that initializes the array `nums` and its length `size_nums`, prints the array before and after sorting, and calls the `sort` function.

Here's the equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:

```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that sorts an array of integers using bubble sort
SC_MODULE(BubbleSort) {
    sc_in<int> nums_in[MAX_NUM];  // Input port for the array of integers
    sc_in<int> len;               // Input port for the length of the array
    sc_out<int> nums_out[MAX_NUM]; // Output port for the sorted array
    sc_out<bool> is_sorted;       // Output port for the sorted flag

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BubbleSort) {
        // Process to perform bubble sort
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << nums_in << len;
    }

    // Sorting method using bubble sort
    void sort() {
        int n = len.read();
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (nums_in[j].read() > nums_in[j + 1].read()) {
                    // Swap the two elements
                    int tmp = nums_in[j].read();
                    nums_in[j].write(nums_in[j + 1].read());
                    nums_in[j + 1].write(tmp);
                }
            }
        }
        is_sorted.write(true);
    }
};
```

In the above SystemC code, we define a module called `BubbleSort` that takes an array of integers `nums_in` and its length `len` as input, and outputs the sorted array `nums_out` and a boolean flag `is_sorted` indicating whether the array is sorted or not.

The `BubbleSort` module has a constructor that declares a sorting process `sort` that is sensitive to changes in `nums_in` and `len`.

The `sort` process performs bubble sort on the input array using the same algorithm as the C++/C code. It iterates through the array `n-1` times, where `n` is the length of the array, and swaps the elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm stops when no swaps are made, indicating that the array is sorted. The `is_sorted` flag is set to `true` to indicate that the array is sorted.

Note that we have defined a constant `MAX_NUM` to specify the maximum size of the array, and `nums_in` and `nums_out` are defined as arrays of size `MAX_NUM`.

Also, note that this SystemC code can be used in a high-level synthesis flow by incorporating the provided signals `clk`, `start`, and `done` to create a testbench that can simulate the sorting algorithm and verify its correctness.
