  **Inputs and Outputs:**

* Inputs:
	+ `in`: A positive integer that represents the input number for which the factorial is being calculated.
* Outputs:
	+ `out`: The factorial of the input number.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the `iostream` header file, which allows us to use input/output stream functions like `cin` and `cout`.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line tells the compiler to use the `std` namespace, which contains functions like `cout` and `cin`.
3. `factorial(unsigned int n)`: This is a function that takes a positive integer `n` as an input and calculates its factorial.
4. `int res = 1, i;`: These lines declare two variables: `res` is the result of the factorial calculation, and `i` is a loop variable that will be used in the `for` loop.
5. `for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)`: This line starts a `for` loop that will execute `n-1` times, since we already have `res` as `1`. The loop starts from `2` since `0!` and `1!` are both `1`.
6. `res *= i;`: This line updates the value of `res` by multiplying it with the current value of `i`.
7. `return res;`: This line returns the final value of `res`, which is the factorial of `n`.
8. `int num = 5;`: This line declares a variable `num` and initializes it with the value `5`.
9. `cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;`: This line outputs the factorial of `num` to the console using the `cout` stream.
10. `return 0;`: This line is the return statement of the `main` function. Since the program terminated successfully, we return the value `0`.

**SystemC Code:**

Here's a SystemC code snippet that represents the same logic as the C++ source code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that computes the factorial of an input number
SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> in;     // Input port for the input number
    sc_out<unsigned int> out;   // Output port for the factorial

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
        SC_METHOD(factorial);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    // Function to compute the factorial
    void factorial() {
        sc_uint<32> res = 1;
        sc_uint<32> i;
        for (i = 2; i <= in.read(); i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        out.write(res);
    }
};

// Testbench to drive the Factorial module
int sc_main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    sc_signal<unsigned int> in;  // Input signal
    sc_signal<unsigned int> out;  // Output signal

    // Instantiate the Factorial module
    Factorial factorial("factorial", in, out);

    // Drive the input signal with a value of 5
    in.write(5);

    // Run the simulation
    sc_start();

    // Read the output signal and print it to the console
    sc_uint<32> result = out.read();
    std::cout << "Factorial of 5 is " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
Note that we've used the `sc_uint<32>` data type to represent the signed integers in the SystemC code. This data type represents a 32-bit signed integer. We've also used the `sc_signal<>` template to create input and output signals for the Factorial module.
