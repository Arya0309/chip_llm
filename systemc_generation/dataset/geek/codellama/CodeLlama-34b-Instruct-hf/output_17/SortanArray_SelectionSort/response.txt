  **Inputs:**

* `arr`: an array of integers to be sorted
* `n`: the size of the `arr` array

**Outputs:**

* `arr`: the sorted array
* `n`: the size of the sorted array

**Explanation:**

The code provided is a C++ implementation of the selection sort algorithm. The algorithm divides the input array into two parts: a sorted subarray and an unsorted subarray. Initially, the sorted subarray is empty, and the unsorted subarray contains all the elements of the input array. The algorithm iterates over the unsorted subarray, finds the smallest element in it, swaps it with the first element of the unsorted subarray, and inserts it into the end of the sorted subarray. This process continues until the unsorted subarray becomes empty, and the sorted subarray contains all the elements of the input array in sorted order.

The code starts by including the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which contains declarations for several standard library functions, including `cout` and `endl`. The `using namespace std;` statement allows us to use these functions without qualifying them with the `std::` prefix.

The `swap` function is a simple utility function that swaps the values of two integer variables. It takes two pointers `xp` and `yp` as parameters and uses a temporary variable to store the value of `*xp`, then assigns `*xp` the value of `*yp`, and finally assigns `*yp` the value of the temporary variable.

The `selectionSort` function is the main algorithm that performs the selection sort. It takes an array `arr` of integers and its size `n` as parameters. The function iterates over the array using the `for` loop, starting from the beginning of the unsorted subarray and ending at the end of the unsorted subarray.

Within the loop, the function finds the minimum element in the unsorted subarray using another `for` loop that starts from the current index of the outer loop and ends at the last index of the unsorted subarray. The minimum element is located at the index `min_idx`.

The function then swaps the minimum element with the first element of the unsorted subarray using the `swap` function. This moves the minimum element to the sorted subarray, and the first element of the unsorted subarray becomes the next element to be sorted.

The function ends when the outer loop has traversed the entire unsorted subarray, and the sorted subarray contains all the elements of the input array in sorted order.

The `main` function is the entry point of the program, which initializes an array `arr` of integers and its size `n`. It then calls the `selectionSort` function to sort the array. Finally, it prints the sorted array using the `printArray` function.

**SystemC Code:**
```c++
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to implement selection sort
SC_MODULE(SelectionSort) {
    sc_in<int> arr[];        // Input port for the array to be sorted
    sc_in<int> n;            // Input port for the size of the array
    sc_out<int> sorted[];    // Output port for the sorted array

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SelectionSort) {
        // Process to perform selection sort
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << arr[0] << n;
    }

    // Method to perform selection sort
    void sort() {
        int i, j, min_idx;
        // Iterate over unsorted subarray
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Find minimum element in unsorted subarray
            min_idx = i;
            for (j = i; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) {
                    min_idx = j;
                }
            }
            // Swap minimum element with first element of unsorted subarray
            swap(arr[min_idx], arr[i]);
        }
        // Set sorted array
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sorted[i] = arr[i];
        }
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we define a module called `SelectionSort` that takes three ports: an input port `arr` for the array to be sorted, an input port `n` for the size of the array, and an output port `sorted` for the sorted array.

The constructor initializes the `sort` method, which is sensitive to the `arr[0]` and `n` input ports. The `sort` method performs the selection sort algorithm by iterating over the unsorted subarray using the `for` loop, finding the minimum element using another `for` loop, and swapping the minimum element with the first element of the unsorted subarray using the `swap` function. Finally, the method sets the output port `sorted` to the sorted array.

Note that the SystemC code uses the same `swap` function as the C++ code, and the `sc_in` and `sc_out` ports are used to model the input and output ports of the algorithm, respectively.
