  **Inputs:**

* `real1`: The real part of the first complex number.
* `imag1`: The imaginary part of the first complex number.
* `real2`: The real part of the second complex number.
* `imag2`: The imaginary part of the second complex number.

**Outputs:**

* `real_sum`: The real part of the sum of the two complex numbers.
* `imag_sum`: The imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers.

**Summary of C++/C Code:**

The code defines a user-defined `Complex` class that represents a complex number. The class has two public members: `real` and `imaginary`, which are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively. The class also has a constructor, which initializes the `real` and `imaginary` parts of the complex number.

The `Complex` class has a method called `addComp()` that takes two `Complex` objects as input and returns a `Complex` object that represents the sum of the two input complex numbers. The method first computes the real part of the sum by adding the real parts of the two input complex numbers, and then computes the imaginary part of the sum by adding the imaginary parts of the two input complex numbers.

The main function creates two `Complex` objects, `C1` and `C2`, and initializes them with the given real and imaginary parts. It then calls the `addComp()` method on `C1` and `C2` to compute the sum of the two complex numbers, and finally prints the real and imaginary parts of the sum to the console.

**SystemC Code:**

Here is a SystemC code snippet that models the logic of the C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for real part of first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for imaginary part of first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for real part of second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for imaginary part of second complex number
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for real part of sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for imaginary part of sum

    // Process to perform addition
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        SC_METHOD(addComp);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void addComp() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```
This SystemC module has input ports for the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers, and output ports for the real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers. The `addComp()` method is a process that computes the sum of the two complex numbers and writes the result to the output ports. The `addComp()` method is triggered by changes to the input ports.
