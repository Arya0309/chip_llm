  **Inputs:**

* A 2D array of doubles named "a" with dimensions MAXN x MAXN, where MAXN is a constant with a value of 105.
* The size of the 2D array (i.e., the number of rows and columns) is passed as an integer parameter named "n".

**Outputs:**

* A double value named "det", which represents the calculated determinant of the input matrix.

**Summary:**
The program takes a 2D array of doubles as input, and calculates its determinant. The determinant is defined as the product of the elements on the main diagonal of the matrix, divided by the product of the elements on the sub diagonals. The program uses a recursive algorithm to calculate the determinant. It takes the size of the matrix as an input, and it works for square matrices only.

The program first initializes an array "a" with the input values, and then it calculates the determinant using the recursive algorithm. The program uses a temporary array "matrix" to store the values of the matrix, and a variable "det" to store the determinant.

The main logic of the program is located in the "determinant" function, which takes the size of the matrix as an input, and returns the calculated determinant. The function starts by initializing the determinant to 1.0, and then it loops through the elements of the matrix, starting from the top-left corner. For each element, it checks if the element on the sub diagonal is zero, and if it is not zero, it adds the product of the element and the determinant of the sub matrix to the determinant. If the element on the sub diagonal is zero, it adds the product of the element and the determinant of the sub matrix divided by the product of the elements on the sub diagonal.

After the loop, the function returns the calculated determinant.

**SystemC code:**

Here is a SystemC code snippet that reflects the same behavior of the original C++/C code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that computes the determinant of a 2D array of doubles
SC_MODULE(Determinant) {
    sc_in<double> matrix[SIZE];  // Input port for the 2D array of doubles
    sc_in<int> n;  // Input port for the size of the matrix
    sc_out<double> det;  // Output port for the determinant

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Determinant) {
        // Process to calculate the determinant
        SC_METHOD(determinant);
        sensitive << matrix << n;
    }

    // Method to calculate the determinant
    void determinant() {
        det.write(determinant(n.read(), matrix.read()));
    }

    // Function to calculate the determinant
    double determinant(int n, double** matrix) {
        double det = 1.0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int pivot = i;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (abs(matrix[j][i]) > abs(matrix[pivot][i])) {
                    pivot = j;
                }
            }
            if (pivot != i) {
                swap(matrix[i], matrix[pivot]);
                det *= -1;
            }
            if (matrix[i][i] == 0) {
                return 0;
            }
            det *= matrix[i][i];
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                double factor = matrix[j][i] / matrix[i][i];
                for (int k = i + 1; k < n; k++) {
                    matrix[j][k] -= factor * matrix[i][k];
                }
            }
        }
        return det;
    }
};
```
