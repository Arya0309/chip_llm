  **Inputs and Outputs:**

* Inputs:
	+ `matrix` - a two-dimensional array of integers, representing the input matrix.
	+ `n` - an integer, representing the size of the matrix (i.e. the number of rows/columns).
* Outputs:
	+ `principal` - an integer, representing the sum of the elements along the principal diagonal of the matrix.
	+ `secondary` - an integer, representing the sum of the elements along the secondary diagonal of the matrix.

**Code Summary:**

The provided C++ code defines a function called `printDiagonalSums` that takes two arguments: `mat` which is a two-dimensional array of integers, and `n` which is an integer. The function calculates the sum of the elements along the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix and prints the results to the console.

The code begins by declaring two local variables `principal` and `secondary`, which are initialized to 0. These variables will be used to store the sum of the elements along the diagonals of the matrix.

The function then enters a nested loop that iterates `n` times. In each iteration, the function checks whether the current element is on the principal diagonal (i.e. the element with indices `i` and `j` is on the same diagonal) or on the secondary diagonal (i.e. the element with indices `i` and `n-1-j` is on the same diagonal). If the current element is on either diagonal, its value is added to the appropriate variable (i.e. `principal` or `secondary`).

After the nested loop has finished, the function prints the results to the console by calling `cout` twice. The first call prints the sum of the principal diagonal, and the second call prints the sum of the secondary diagonal.

**SystemC Code:**

Here is a SystemC code snippet that captures the logic of the original C++ code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates the sum of the elements along the diagonals of a matrix
SC_MODULE(DiagonalSum) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE][SIZE]; // Input port for the matrix
    sc_out<int> principal; // Output port for the sum of the principal diagonal
    sc_out<int> secondary; // Output port for the sum of the secondary diagonal

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSum) {
        // Process to calculate the sums
        SC_METHOD(calculate);
        sensitive << matrix;
    }

    // Method to calculate the sums
    void calculate() {
        // Initialize outputs to 0
        principal.write(0);
        secondary.write(0);

        // Iterate over the matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                // Check if element is on principal diagonal
                if (i == j) {
                    principal.write(principal.read() + matrix[i][j]);
                }

                // Check if element is on secondary diagonal
                if ((i + j) == (SIZE - 1)) {
                    secondary.write(secondary.read() + matrix[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `DiagonalSum` module takes a two-dimensional array of integers as input, and outputs the sum of the elements along the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix. The `calculate` method iterates over the matrix and checks whether each element is on either diagonal. If the element is on a diagonal, its value is added to the appropriate output port.
