  **Inputs:**

* P: The principal amount
* R: The rate of interest
* T: The time period

**Outputs:**

* SI: The simple interest

**Summary:**
This C++ program calculates the simple interest for a given principal amount, time period, and rate of interest. The program first defines the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period as input variables and then calculates the simple interest by multiplying the principal amount, time period, and rate of interest and dividing the result by 100. Finally, the program prints the resultant value of simple interest.

**Corresponding SystemC Code with Integrated Signals:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(InterestCalculator) {
    sc_in<float> P;  // Input port for principal amount
    sc_in<float> R;  // Input port for rate of interest
    sc_in<float> T;  // Input port for time period
    sc_out<float> SI;  // Output port for simple interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(InterestCalculator) {
        // Process to calculate simple interest
        SC_METHOD(calculateInterest);
        sensitive << P << R << T;
    }

    // Method to calculate simple interest
    void calculateInterest() {
        SI.write((P.read() * T.read() * R.read()) / 100);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined three input ports, P, R, and T, and one output port, SI, which correspond to the input variables and the output of the interest calculation, respectively. We have also defined a constructor that sets up the sensitivity of the module to the input ports P, R, and T. The method `calculateInterest` performs the calculation of the simple interest and writes the result to the output port SI.

Note that the signals defined in the testbench (`sc_in<float> P;`, `sc_in<float> R;`, `sc_in<float> T;`, and `sc_out<float> SI;`) are used in the SystemC code to ensure seamless integration with the existing testbench.
