  **Inputs:**

* `n`: an integer input representing the number to be checked for armstrong numberness.

**Outputs:**

* `is_armstrong`: a boolean output indicating whether `n` is an armstrong number (the method returns `True` if `n` is an armstrong number and `False` otherwise).

**Summary:**

The given C++/C code is a simple program that takes an integer input `n` and checks whether it is an armstrong number. An armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits. For example, 153 is an armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.

The program defines a variable `temp` to store the value of `n` before any changes are made to it. The program then declares a variable `p` to store the sum of the cubes of the digits of `n`.

The program then enters a `while` loop that runs until `n` is equal to 0. Inside the loop, the program first calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 and assigns it to a variable `rem`. It then increments `p` by the cube of `rem`. Finally, the program divides `n` by 10 and assigns the result back to `n`.

After the `while` loop terminates, the program checks if the value of `p` is equal to `temp`. If it is, then `n` is an armstrong number, and the program prints a message to the console. Otherwise, the program prints a message to the console indicating that `n` is not an armstrong number.

**SystemC Equivalent:**

Here is a SystemC equivalent of the given C++/C code:
```c++
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong;

    // Process to calculate the sum of the cubes of the digits
    SC_METHOD(calculate_cube_sum) {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int p = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p += rem * rem * rem;
            n /= 10;
        }
        is_armstrong.write(p == num_in.read());
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define an `ArmstrongChecker` module that takes in an integer input `num_in` and an output `is_armstrong`. The module has a process named `calculate_cube_sum` that calculates the sum of the cubes of the digits of `num_in` and stores the result in `is_armstrong`. The process is triggered when there is a change in `num_in`.

Note that in the `while` loop of the SystemC code, we use the `.read()` method to read the value of `num_in` and the `.write()` method to write the result back to `is_armstrong`. These methods are used to synchronize the access to the signals between the process and the outside world.
