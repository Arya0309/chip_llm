  **Inputs:**

* `dec_in`: a decimal integer to be converted to binary.

**Outputs:**

* `binary_out`: a binary representation of the input decimal number.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. The code starts by including the `iostream` header file, which is required for input/output operations in C++.
2. The `using namespace std;` statement allows us to use the standard C++ namespace, which contains the input/output functionality.
3. The `decToBinary` function is declared, which takes a single argument `n`, which is the decimal number to be converted to binary.
4. The function declares an array `binaryNum` of size 32, which will store the binary representation of the input decimal number.
5. The function declares a counter `i` to keep track of the current bit being processed in the binary representation.
6. The function starts a `while` loop to convert the input decimal number. The loop continues until the number is 0.
7. Inside the loop, the remainder is calculated by `n % 2`, which is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the last bit of the number is 0 or 1. The remainder is then stored in the `binaryNum` array at the position indicated by the `i` counter.
8. The loop increments the `i` counter and divides the number by 2 using `n = n / 2`.
9. After the loop finishes, the binary representation is printed to the console in reverse order using a `for` loop. The loop starts at the highest bit (position `i-1`) and goes down to the lowest bit (position 0).
10. The `main` function is where the program starts executing. It initializes the input decimal number to 10 and calls the `decToBinary` function to convert it to binary.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that converts a decimal number to binary
SC_MODULE(Dec2Bin) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out;  // Output port for binary number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Dec2Bin) {
        // Process to perform conversion
        SC_METHOD(convert);
    }

    // Method to convert decimal to binary
    void convert() {
        int i = 0;
        while (dec_in.read() > 0) {
            binary_out.write(dec_in.read() % 2);
            dec_in.write(dec_in.read() / 2);
            i++;
        }
        binary_out.write(dec_in.read());
    }
};
```
The SystemC code defines a module `Dec2Bin` with two input ports:

* `dec_in`: an `sc_in<int>` port for the input decimal number.
* `binary_out`: an `sc_out<int>` port for the output binary number.

The module has one method, `convert`, which performs the conversion of the input decimal number to a binary number and writes the result to the `binary_out` port. The method starts by initializing a counter `i` to 0. Then it enters a `while` loop that continues until the input decimal number is 0. Inside the loop, the method calculates the remainder of `dec_in.read()` by 2 and writes it to the `binary_out` port using `binary_out.write()`. It then divides the input decimal number by 2 using `dec_in.write(dec_in.read() / 2)`, and increments the counter `i`. After the loop finishes, it writes the final value of `dec_in.read()` to the `binary_out` port.
