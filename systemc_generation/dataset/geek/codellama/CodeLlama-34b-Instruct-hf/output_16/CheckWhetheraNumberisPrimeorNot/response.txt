  Inputs:

* `n`: An integer that is tested for primality.

Outputs:

* `is_prime`: A boolean value indicating whether `n` is prime or not.

Summary:

The program first initializes an integer variable `cnt` to 0, which will be used to count the number of divisors of `n`.

Then, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it is not prime, and the program prints a message to that effect.

Otherwise, the program enters a loop that checks the divisibility of `n` by each integer from 1 to `n`. For each integer `i` that divides `n`, `cnt` is incremented.

After the loop, the program checks if `cnt` is greater than 2. If so, `n` is not prime, and the program prints a message to that effect. Otherwise, `n` is prime, and the program prints a message to that effect.

Finally, the program returns 0, indicating successful termination.

Translation to SystemC:

Here's an equivalent SystemC code snippet, using the provided signals:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n;       // input n
    sc_out<bool> is_prime;  // output is_prime

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        SC_METHOD(check_prime);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to check for primality
    void check_prime() {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        is_prime.write(cnt > 2 ? false : true);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have a module `PrimeChecker` that takes an input `n` and produces an output `is_prime`, which indicates whether `n` is prime or not.

The constructor initializes the method `check_prime` and declares it sensitive to changes in `n`.

The method `check_prime` first initializes `cnt` to 0, Then, it loops through each integer from 1 to `n`, increments `cnt` for each divisor of `n`, and finally, sets `is_prime` to `true` if `cnt` is less than or equal to 2, and `false` otherwise.

Note that this SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code, and it is a direct translation of the former into the latter.
