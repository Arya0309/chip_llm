  Input:

* `in[SIZE]` (array of integers)
* `out[SIZE]` (array of integers)

Output:

* `m` (a 2D array of integers)

Line-by-line explaining the C++/C code:

1. The code starts by including the required header file `iostream`.
2. The next line defines a macro `n` and sets its value to 4.
3. The `interchangeFirstLast` function takes a 2D array of integers as input and has no return type.
4. The function declares two local variables, `rows` and `i`, and initializes `rows` to the number of rows in the array.
5. The function then enters a for loop that iterates over the first row of the array (index 0) and the last row of the array (index `rows - 1`).
6. Inside the for loop, a temporary variable `t` is declared and assigned the value of the element at row 0, column `i`.
7. The element at row 0, column `i` is then assigned the value of the element at row `rows - 1`, column `i`.
8. The element at row `rows - 1`, column `i` is then assigned the value of `t`.
9. The function then exits the for loop and returns.

Next, the code jumps to the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.
10. The `main` function declares a 2D array of integers `m` and initializes it with some test data.
11. The function then calls the `interchangeFirstLast` function, passing `m` as the input.
12. Finally, the function prints the resulting 2D array to the console.

SystemC code:
```c++
#include <systemc.h>

#define n 4

SC_MODULE(Interchanger) {
    sc_in<int> in[n];
    sc_out<int> out[n];

    Interchanger(sc_module_name) {
        // Swap the elements of the first and last rows of the input array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int t = in[0][i];
            in[0][i] = in[n - 1][i];
            in[n - 1][i] = t;
        }

        // Output the updated array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                out[i][j] = in[i][j];
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we define an `Interchanger` module that has two arrays of integers, `in` and `out`, as inputs and outputs. The constructor initializes `in` with some test data, calls the `interchangeFirstLast` function to swap the elements of the first and last rows, and then outputs the resulting array using the `out` ports.

Note that in the SystemC code, we have used the `n` macro to define the size of the arrays, just as we did in the C++/C code. We have also used the `sc_in` and `sc_out` data types to define the input and output ports, respectively. In the constructor, we have used the `in[0][i]` and `in[n - 1][i]` syntax to access the elements of the input array in a row-major order.
