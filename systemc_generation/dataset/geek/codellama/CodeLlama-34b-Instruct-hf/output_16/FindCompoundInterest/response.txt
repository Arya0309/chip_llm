  **Inputs and Outputs:**

* The code takes in three inputs:
	+ `principal`: the initial amount of money in the account
	+ `rate`: the annual interest rate as a percentage
	+ `time`: the number of years the money is left in the account
* The code produces one output:
	+ `CI`: the total compound interest earned over the specified number of years

**Line-by-Line Summary:**

* Line 1: Include the standard C++ header file.
* Line 4: Start the `main()` function, which is the entry point of the program.
* Line 5: Declare three variables: `principal`, `rate`, and `time`, and initialize them to 10000, 5, and 2, respectively.
* Line 7: Calculate the compound interest using the formula: `A = P \* (1 + r/100)^n`, where `P` is the principal, `r` is the annual interest rate, and `n` is the number of years.
* Line 8: Calculate the total interest earned by subtracting the principal from the compound interest.
* Line 9: Print the total interest earned to the console.
* Line 10: Return 0 from the `main()` function, indicating successful termination.

**SystemC Code Snippet:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates compound interest
SC_MODULE(CompoundInterest) {
    sc_in<double> principal;  // Input port for the principal
    sc_in<double> rate;  // Input port for the annual interest rate
    sc_in<double> time;  // Input port for the number of years
    sc_out<double> ci;  // Output port for the compound interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterest) {
        // Process to calculate compound interest
        SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculate_ci() {
        double A = principal.read() * ((pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read())));
        ci.write(A - principal.read());
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code snippet, we define a `CompoundInterest` module that takes in three input signals, `principal`, `rate`, and `time`, and produces one output signal, `ci`. The `calculate_ci()` method is triggered whenever any of the input signals change, and it computes the compound interest using the same formula as the original C++ code. Finally, it writes the result to the `ci` output signal.
