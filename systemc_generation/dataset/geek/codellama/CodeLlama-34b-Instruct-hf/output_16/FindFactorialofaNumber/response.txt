  **Inputs**:
The input to the program is an integer parameter `num` that is passed to the function `factorial`.

**Outputs**:
The output of the program is the factorial of the input number, which is printed to the console.

**Summary**:
The program defines a function `factorial` that takes an integer parameter `n` and calculates its factorial. The function initializes a variable `res` to 1 and iterates over the range of integers from 2 to `n`, multiplying `res` by each integer in the range. Finally, the function returns `res`, which is the factorial of `n`.

The `main` function takes a single argument, `num`, and calls the `factorial` function with `num` as its argument. The function then prints the result of the `factorial` function to the console.

**SystemC Code**:
```
// Module that calculates the factorial of a number
SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> num;  // Input port for the number to calculate factorial of
    sc_out<unsigned int> output;  // Output port for the factorial

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
        // Process to perform factorial calculation
        SC_METHOD(calculate_factorial);
        sensitive << num;
    }

    // Method to calculate the factorial
    void calculate_factorial() {
        unsigned int res = 1, i;
        for (i = 2; i <= num.read(); i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        output.write(res);
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we define a module called `Factorial` that takes an `sc_in` port for the input number and an `sc_out` port for the output factorial. The module contains a process that calculates the factorial of the input number using the same logic as the original function. The process is sensitive to changes in the `num` input port, and it writes the calculated factorial to the `output` port.
