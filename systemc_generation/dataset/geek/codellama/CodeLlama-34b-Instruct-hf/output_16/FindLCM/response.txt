  **Inputs:**

* `a`: an integer value representing the first number
* `b`: an integer value representing the second number

**Outputs:**

* `lcm_result`: an integer value representing the least common multiple (LCM) of the two input numbers

**Natural Language Summary:**

The provided C++/C code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using a combination of if statements and loops. The code first declares two integer variables, `a` and `b`, and sets their values to 15 and 20, respectively. The code then calculates the maximum of the two numbers using the ternary operator.

The code then enters a while loop that continues until the variable `flag` is set to false. Inside the loop, the code checks if `max_num` is completely divisible by both `a` and `b` using the logical AND operator (&&). If the condition is true, the code prints the result to the console and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the code increments `max_num` by 1.

**SystemC Code:**

Here is an example SystemC code that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LCM) {
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;
    sc_out<int> lcm_result;

    void calc_lcm() {
        int max_num, flag = 1;

        max_num = (a > b) ? a : b;

        while (flag) {
            if ((max_num % a == 0) && (max_num % b == 0)) {
                lcm_result.write(max_num);
                flag = 0;
                break;
            }
            max_num++;
        }
    }

    SC_CTOR(LCM) {
        SC_THREAD(calc_lcm);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }
};
```
In this code, we define an `LCM` module that contains the input and output ports `a`, `b`, and `lcm_result`. The `calc_lcm` method is responsible for calculating the LCM and writing the result to the `lcm_result` port. The `SC_THREAD` statement is used to create a separate thread for the `calc_lcm` method, which runs whenever the value of `a` or `b` changes.
