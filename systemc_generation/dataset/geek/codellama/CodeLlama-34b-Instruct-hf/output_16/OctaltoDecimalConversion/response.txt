  **Inputs**:

* `octal_input`: An integer representing an octal number.

**Outputs**:

* `decimal_output`: An integer representing the decimal equivalent of the input octal number.

**Summary**:

The provided C++ program defines a function `octalToDecimal()` that takes an integer parameter `n` representing an octal number, and returns its decimal equivalent. The function does this by first initializing two variables:

* `num`: A copy of the input `n` is made and assigned to `num`.
* `dec_value`: An integer variable to store the decimal equivalent of `num`.
* `base`: An integer variable to store the base value, which is initialized to 1.

The function then enters a while loop where it extracts the last digit of `num` using the modulo operator and divides it by 10 using integer division. The remaining value is stored back in `num` and the base value is multiplied by 8 using `base = base * 8;`.

The last digit extracted is then multiplied by the base value and added to `dec_value` using `dec_value += last_digit * base;`. This process is repeated until `num` is 0, at which point the function returns `dec_value`.

In the main() function, the input octal number is first assigned to the variable `num` and then passed to the function `octalToDecimal()`. The returned decimal value is then printed to the console using `cout`.

**SystemC Code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that converts octal to decimal
SC_MODULE(OctalToDecimal) {
    sc_in<int> octal_input;        // Input port for octal number
    sc_out<int> decimal_output;    // Output port for decimal equivalent

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(OctalToDecimal) {
        // Process to perform conversion
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << octal_input;
    }

    // Method to convert octal to decimal
    void convert() {
        int num = octal_input.read();
        int dec_value = 0;
        int base = 1;

        while (num) {
            int last_digit = num % 10;
            num = num / 10;
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base = base * 8;
        }

        decimal_output.write(dec_value);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the module `OctalToDecimal` takes an input port `octal_input` and an output port `decimal_output`. The constructor initializes the process to perform the conversion and makes the input port sensitive to the process.

The `convert()` method takes the input octal number from the `octal_input` port and stores it in the variable `num`. It then initializes two variables: `dec_value` to 0 and `base` to 1.

The method then enters a while loop where it extracts the last digit of `num` using the modulo operator and divides it by 10 using integer division. The remaining value is stored back in `num` and the base value is multiplied by 8 using `base = base * 8;`.

The last digit extracted is then multiplied by the base value and added to `dec_value` using `dec_value += last_digit * base;`. This process is repeated until `num` is 0, at which point the method writes the converted decimal value to the `decimal_output` port.

Note that the I/O signals defined above are used in the SystemC code to ensure proper integration with the testbench.
