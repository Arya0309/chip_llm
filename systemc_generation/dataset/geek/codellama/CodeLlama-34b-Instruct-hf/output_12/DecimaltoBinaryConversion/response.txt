  **Inputs:**

* `n`: decimal number to be converted to binary

**Outputs:**

* Binary representation of `n`

**Natural Language Summary of C++/C Code**:

The provided code is a simple C++ program that takes a decimal number as input and converts it to a binary number. The program defines a function `decToBinary(int n)` that takes in the decimal number `n` as an argument.

The function first defines an array `binaryNum` to store the binary representation of `n`. The variable `i` is used as a counter to keep track of the current index in the array.

The function then enters a `while` loop that continues to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, the function calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 2 and stores it in the `i`th index of the `binaryNum` array. The variable `n` is then updated by dividing it by 2.

After the loop, the function prints the contents of the `binaryNum` array in reverse order. This is done by starting from the last index of the array, i.e., `i-1`, and printing each element until the first index of the array is reached.

**SystemC Code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DecimalToBinary) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;    // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for the binary number

    void decToBinary() {
        int binaryNum[32];
        int i = 0;
        while (dec_in.read() > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = dec_in.read() % 2;
            dec_in.write(dec_in.read() / 2);
            i++;
        }
        for (int j = i-1; j >= 0; j--)
            binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we define a module `DecimalToBinary` that has two ports: `dec_in` for input and `binary_out` for output. The module has a single function `decToBinary()` that takes no arguments.

The function first defines an array `binaryNum` and a variable `i` to keep track of the current index in the array. The function then enters a `while` loop that continues to execute as long as the input decimal number `dec_in` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, the function calculates the remainder of `dec_in` divided by 2 and stores it in the `i`th index of the `binaryNum` array. The `dec_in` variable is then updated by dividing it by 2.

After the loop, the function prints the contents of the `binaryNum` array in reverse order to the `binary_out` port. This is done by starting from the last index of the array, i.e., `i-1`, and printing each element until the first index of the array is reached.

Note that the SystemC code takes advantage of the SystemC ports `dec_in` and `binary_out` to promote modularity and reusability. These ports can be easily connected to other SystemC modules or testbenches to form a larger digital system.
