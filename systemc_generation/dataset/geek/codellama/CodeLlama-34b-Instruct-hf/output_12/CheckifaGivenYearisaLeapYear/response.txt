  Inputs:

* Year (int year)

Outputs:

* is_leap_year (bool)

Description:

The code is a C++ program that takes an integer input representing a year and checks whether it is a leap year or not. The function checkYear() takes an integer parameter year and returns true if the year is a leap year, and false otherwise. The driver code takes an integer input of 2000 and passes it to the checkYear() function, which prints "Leap Year" if the input is a leap year, and "Not a Leap Year" otherwise.

SystemC code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks if a year is a leap year
SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    sc_in<int> year;
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
        // Process to check if the input year is a leap year
        SC_METHOD(checkYear);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    // Method to check if the input year is a leap year
    void checkYear() {
        if (year.read() % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year.read() % 100 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        } else if (year.read() % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called LeapYearChecker that takes an integer year as input and returns a boolean is_leap_year. The checkYear() method checks the input year and uses several if-else statements to determine whether it is a leap year or not. If the year is divisible by 400, it returns true, if it is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it returns false, and if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it returns true. Finally, if the year is not divisible by 400, 100, or 4, it returns false. The sensitivity list of the process is set to year to indicate that the code inside the process should be executed every time the year input changes.

Note that the SystemC code uses the sc_in and sc_out ports to communicate with the outside world, which is a standard practice in SystemC. The sc_in port is used to read data from outside, while the sc_out port is used to write data to outside. The sc_in and sc_out ports should be connected to the appropriate signals in the testbench to enable communication between the module and the testbench.
