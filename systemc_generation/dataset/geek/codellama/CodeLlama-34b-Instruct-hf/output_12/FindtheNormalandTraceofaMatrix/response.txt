  Summary:
The program is designed to calculate the trace and normal of a given matrix. The size of the matrix is assumed to be a constant MAX = 100.

The program defines two functions:

1. `findTrace`: This function takes a 2D matrix and its size as inputs, and returns the trace of the matrix. The algorithm used in this function is as follows:
	* Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
	* Iterate through each element of the matrix using two nested loops.
	* For each element, add it to the `sum` variable.
	* Return the `sum` variable.
2. `findNormal`: This function takes a 2D matrix and its size as inputs, and returns the normal of the matrix. The algorithm used in this function is as follows:
	* Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
	* Iterate through each element of the matrix using two nested loops.
	* For each element, add its square to the `sum` variable.
	* Return the square root of the `sum` variable.

The program also defines a `main` function that takes no arguments and performs the following:

1. Define a 5x5 matrix `mat` with all elements set to 1.
2. Print the trace of the matrix using the `findTrace` function.
3. Print the normal of the matrix using the `findNormal` function.

Inputs:

* A 2D matrix of size MAX x MAX.
* The size of the matrix (an integer).

Outputs:

* The trace of the matrix (an integer).
* The normal of the matrix (a float).

SystemC Code:

```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Matrix) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[MAX];  // Input port for the matrix
    sc_in<int> size;  // Input port for the matrix size
    sc_out<int> trace;  // Output port for the trace
    sc_out<int> norm;  // Output port for the normal

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Matrix) {
        // Process to find the trace
        SC_METHOD(findTrace);
        sensitive << matrix << size;

        // Process to find the normal
        SC_METHOD(findNormal);
        sensitive << matrix << size;
    }

    // Method to find the trace
    void findTrace() {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < size; j++) {
                sum += matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        trace.write(sum);
    }

    // Method to find the normal
    void findNormal() {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < size; j++) {
                sum += matrix[i][j] * matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        norm.write(sqrt(sum));
    }
};
```

In the SystemC code, we have defined a `Matrix` module that takes the inputs `matrix` and `size` and outputs `trace` and `norm`. The module has two processes: `findTrace` and `findNormal`. These processes are triggered by the `matrix` and `size` inputs, and they calculate the trace and normal of the matrix accordingly. The `trace` and `norm` outputs are written to the corresponding output ports at the end of each process.

Note that we have used the `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<int>` types to represent the input and output ports, respectively. These types are included in the SystemC standard library and allow for the declaration of input and output ports.

Also, we have used the `sqrt` function from the `cmath` library to calculate the square root of the sum of squares in the `findNormal` method. This function is included in the SystemC standard library and can be used to perform mathematical operations on signal values.
