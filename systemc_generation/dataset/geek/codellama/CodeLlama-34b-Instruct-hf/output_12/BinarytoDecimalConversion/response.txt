  **Inputs and Outputs:**

The C++/C code provided is a program that takes a binary number as input and outputs the decimal equivalent of that number. The input is a binary number represented as an integer, and the output is the decimal equivalent of that number also represented as an integer.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

The C++/C code is divided into two parts: the function that converts binary to decimal, and the driver code that tests the function.

1. The function `binaryToDecimal` takes an integer input `n` and returns an integer output `dec_value`.
2. The function declares two local variables: `num` and `dec_value`, which are initialized to the value of `n` and 0, respectively.
3. The function also declares a local variable `temp`, which is initialized to the value of `num`.
4. The function then enters a while loop that iterates until `temp` is 0.
5. Inside the loop, the function extracts the last digit of `temp` using the modulo operator (`% 10`) and stores it in `last_digit`.
6. The function then divides `temp` by 10 to move to the next digit, and updates the value of `base` by multiplying it by 2.
7. The function then updates the value of `dec_value` by adding `last_digit` multiplied by `base` to it.
8. The function repeats steps 5-7 until the loop exits when `temp` is 0.
9. Finally, the function returns `dec_value`.

**Driver Code:**

The driver code declares an integer variable `num` and initializes it to the value 10101001.

The driver code then calls the function `binaryToDecimal` with `num` as the argument, and prints the result to the console using `cout`.

**SystemC Code:**

The SystemC code is a Module called `BinaryToDecimal` that takes an input port `binary_in` and an output port `decimal_out`.

The module has two local variables: `num` and `dec_value`, which are updated in the same way as the C++/C code.

The module also has a process `update_dec_value`, which is sensitive to changes in `binary_in`. Whenever a change is detected, the process updates `num` and `dec_value` using the same logic as the C++/C code, and writes the updated value of `dec_value` to `decimal_out`.

Here is the SystemC code snippet:
```scss
#include <systemc>

SC_MODULE(BinaryToDecimal) {
    sc_in<int> binary_in;
    sc_out<int> decimal_out;

    int num, dec_value;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinaryToDecimal) {
        // Process to update dec_value
        SC_METHOD(update_dec_value);
        sensitive << binary_in;
    }

    // Method to update dec_value
    void update_dec_value() {
        int temp = binary_in.read();
        while (temp) {
            int last_digit = temp % 10;
            temp = temp / 10;
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base *= 2;
        }
        decimal_out.write(dec_value);
    }
};
```
