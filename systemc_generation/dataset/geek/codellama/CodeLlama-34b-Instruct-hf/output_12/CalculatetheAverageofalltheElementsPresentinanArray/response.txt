  **Inputs:**

* `data_in`: An array of integers to be analyzed.
* `size`: The number of elements in the `data_in` array.

**Outputs:**

* `average_out`: The average of the elements in the `data_in` array.

**Summary:**
The provided C++/C code calculates the average of an array of integers. The code defines a function `average` that takes an array of integers `a` and its size `n` as inputs. The function calculates the sum of the array elements using a for loop, and then returns the average by dividing the sum by `n`. The `main` function defines an array `arr` of integers and calculates its average using the `average` function.

**SystemC Code:**

```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(AverageCalculator) {
    sc_in<double> average_out;
    sc_vector<sc_in<int>> data_in;

    void calculateAverage() {
        double sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < data_in.size(); i++) {
            sum += data_in[i];
        }
        average_out.write(sum / data_in.size());
    }
};
```

In the SystemC code, the `AverageCalculator` module takes an array of integers `data_in` and calculates its average using the `calculateAverage` function. The function calculates the sum of the array elements and divides it by the size of the array to get the average. The `average_out` signal is used to write the calculated average to the output port.

Note that the SystemC code uses the same input and output signals as the original C++/C code, but it simplifies the code and makes it more readable by using the vector and array types provided by SystemC.
