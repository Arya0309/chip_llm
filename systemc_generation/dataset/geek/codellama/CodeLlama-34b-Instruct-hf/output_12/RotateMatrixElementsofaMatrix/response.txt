  **Inputs:**

* `mat[R][C]`: A 2D matrix of size `R` by `C`, where `R` and `C` are defined as global constants.
* `row`: The starting row index of the matrix.
* `col`: The starting column index of the matrix.

**Outputs:**

* `mat[R][C]`: The rotated matrix, also stored in `mat[R][C]`.

**Summary:**

The code defines a function `rotatematrix` that takes a 2D matrix of size `R` by `C`, along with the starting row and column indices, and rotates the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. The function uses a series of nested loops to iterate over the matrix, moving elements from the first row to the last column, and then from the last row to the first column, and finally from the last column to the first row. The function prints the rotated matrix to the console.

**SystemC Equivalent:**

Here is an equivalent SystemC code that implements the same logic as the C++ code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(RotateMatrix) {
    sc_in<int> mat[R][C]; // Input matrix
    sc_out<int> out[R][C]; // Output matrix
    sc_in<int> row; // Starting row index
    sc_in<int> col; // Starting column index

    SC_METHOD(rotatematrix) {
        // Loop over the rows
        for (int i = 0; i < R; i++) {
            // Loop over the columns
            for (int j = 0; j < C; j++) {
                // Swap the elements in the top-left and bottom-right corners
                out[i][j] <= mat[i][j];
                out[j][i] <= mat[i][j];
                // Swap the elements in the bottom-left and top-right corners
                out[i + 1][j] <= mat[i][j];
                out[j + 1][i + 1] <= mat[i][j];
                // Swap the elements in the top-right and bottom-left corners
                out[i][j + 1] <= mat[i][j];
                out[j + 1][i] <= mat[i][j];
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In this code, we define a SystemC module called `RotateMatrix` that takes the input matrix, the output matrix, the starting row and column indices as inputs. The module contains a single method `rotatematrix` that has the same logic as the C++ code. The method uses a series of nested loops to iterate over the matrix, moving elements from the first row to the last column, and then from the last row to the first column, and finally from the last column to the first row, just like the C++ code. The module outputs the rotated matrix to the console.
