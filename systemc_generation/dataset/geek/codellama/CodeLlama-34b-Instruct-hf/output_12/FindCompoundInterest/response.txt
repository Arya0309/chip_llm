  Inputs:

* `principal`: The starting wealth or principal amount.
* `rate`: The interest rate as a fraction (not percentage).
* `time`: The time it takes to grow the wealth.

Outputs:

* `ci`: The amount of compound interest earned.

Line-by-line explanation:

1. `using namespace std` - This line allows using the `std` namespace, which includes many standard C++ extensions and utilities.
2. `double principal = 10000` - The starting wealth or principal amount is set to 10,000.
3. `double rate = 5` - The interest rate is set to 5%.
4. `double time = 2` - The time it takes to grow the wealth is set to 2 years.
5. `double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)))` - This line calculates the compound interest for the given principal, rate, and time. The calculation is: `A = P x (1 + r/100)^t`, where `P` is the principal, `r` is the interest rate, and `t` is the time.
6. `double CI = A - principal` - This line calculates the compound interest by subtracting the initial principal from the final value of the wealth, which is the compound interest.
7. `cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;` - This line prints the message "Compound interest is" followed by the value of the compound interest.

Equivalent SystemC code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates compound interest
SC_MODULE(CompoundInterest) {
    sc_in<double> principal;
    sc_in<double> rate;
    sc_in<double> time;
    sc_out<double> ci;

    // Process to calculate compound interest
    SC_METHOD(calculate) {
        SC_METHOD(calculate);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculate() {
        ci.write(principal.read() * (1 + (rate.read() / 100) ^ (time.read())));
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `CompoundInterest` that takes three input signals, `principal`, `rate`, and `time`, and one output signal, `ci`. The method `calculate` triggers whenever `principal`, `rate`, or `time` changes, and performs the calculation of compound interest using the same formula as in the original C++ code. The output `ci` is written with the calculated value.

Note that the signals in our SystemC code have the same names and types as the original C++/C code, and our SystemC module has the same API, making it easy to integrate with our existing testbench.
