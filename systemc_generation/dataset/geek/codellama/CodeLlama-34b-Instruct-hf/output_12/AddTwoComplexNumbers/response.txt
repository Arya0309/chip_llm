  Inputs:

* `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`: These are the inputs of the C++/C code, which represent the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers.

Outputs:

* `real_sum`, `imag_sum`: These are the outputs of the C++/C code, which represent the real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers.

Line-by-line Summary:

1. The C++/C code declares two classes: `Complex` and `main`.
2. The `Complex` class has two public integer members: `real` and `imaginary`, and a constructor that initializes these members.
3. The `Complex` class also has an `addComp()` method that adds two complex numbers by adding their real and imaginary parts separately, and returns the sum as a new `Complex` object.
4. The `main()` function creates two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` with the real and imaginary parts read from the user.
5. The `main()` function also creates a third `Complex` object `C3` to store the sum of `C1` and `C2`.
6. The `main()` function calls the `addComp()` method to add `C1` and `C2` and store the result in `C3`.
7. Finally, the `main()` function prints out the real and imaginary parts of `C3` using the `<<` operator.

SystemC Code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Define a Complex class
class Complex {
public:
    int real;
    int imaginary;

    // Constructor
    Complex(int tempReal, int tempImaginary) {
        real = tempReal;
        imaginary = tempImaginary;
    }

    // Method to add complex numbers
    void add(Complex C2) {
        Complex temp;
        temp.real = real + C2.real;
        temp.imaginary = imaginary + C2.imaginary;
        this = temp;
    }
};

// Define a Complex Adder module
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;
    sc_in<int> imag1;
    sc_in<int> real2;
    sc_in<int> imag2;
    sc_out<int> real_sum;
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;

    Complex C1;
    Complex C2;
    Complex C3;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        C1 = new Complex(real1.read(), imag1.read());
        C2 = new Complex(real2.read(), imag2.read());
        C3 = new Complex(0, 0);
    }

    // Method to add complex numbers
    void add() {
        C3->add(C2);
        real_sum.write(C3->real);
        imag_sum.write(C3->imaginary);
    }
};

// Main function
int sc_main() {
    // Create a complex adder module
    ComplexAdder complexAdder(real1, imag1, real2, imag2, real_sum, imag_sum);
    complexAdder.add();
    // Print the sum
    cout << "Real Sum: " << real_sum.read() << endl;
    cout << "Imaginary Sum: " << imag_sum.read() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined a `Complex` class that has the same structure and behavior as the `Complex` class in the C++/C code. We have also defined a `ComplexAdder` module that takes four input signals `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, and two output signals `real_sum`, `imag_sum`. The `ComplexAdder` module creates two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` and initializes them with the input signals. It also creates a third `Complex` object `C3` to store the sum of `C1` and `C2`. The `add()` method of the `ComplexAdder` module calls the `add()` method of the `Complex` class to add `C1` and `C2` and store the result in `C3`. The `add()` method then writes the real and imaginary parts of `C3` to the output signals.

In the main function, we create a `ComplexAdder` module and call the `add()` method. We then read the output signals and print the sum.
