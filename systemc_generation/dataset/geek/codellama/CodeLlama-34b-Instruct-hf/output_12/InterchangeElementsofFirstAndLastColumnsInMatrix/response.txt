  Inputs:

* `in[SIZE]`: an array of integers of size `SIZE`
* `out[SIZE]`: an array of integers of size `SIZE`

Outputs:

* The swapped elements of the first row and last row of the input matrix

Explanation of each major line or block of code and its functionality:

* `#include <iostream>`: Include the header file that contains the std namespace, which is required for the input and output operations in the code.
* `using namespace std;`: Use the std namespace to avoid having to type "std::" before each function and object in the standard library.
* `#define n 4`: Define a constant variable 'n' with the value 4. This is used as the number of rows and columns in the input matrix.
* `void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n])`: Define a function `interchangeFirstLast` that takes an integer matrix `m` as a parameter. The function swaps the elements of the first and last rows of the matrix.
* `int rows = n;`: Declare a variable `rows` and initialize it to the value of `n`. This is used as the number of rows in the matrix.
* `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`: Declare a for loop that iterates over the row indices of the matrix, from 0 to `n-1`.
* `int t = m[0][i];`: Declare a variable `t` and initialize it to the element at the first row and current column index (i.e., `m[0][i]`).
* `m[0][i] = m[rows-1][i];`: Assign the element at the last row and current column index (i.e., `m[rows-1][i]`) to the first row and current column index (i.e., `m[0][i]`).
* `m[rows-1][i] = t;`: Assign the value of `t` to the element at the last row and current column index (i.e., `m[rows-1][i]`).
* `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`: Another for loop that iterates over the column indices of the matrix, from 0 to `n-1`.
* `cout << m[i][j] << " ";`: Output the element at row `i` and column `j` of the matrix, followed by a space.
* `int main()`: Define the main function, which contains the driver code.
* `int m[n][n];`: Declare a 2D integer array `m` of size `n`.
* `m[i][j] = ...`: Initialize each element of `m` with a value.
* `interchangeFirstLast(m);`: Call the `interchangeFirstLast` function with `m` as a parameter.
* `cout << ...`: Output the result of the `interchangeFirstLast` function.

SystemC Code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SwapFirstLast) {
    sc_in<int> in[SIZE]; // input matrix
    sc_out<int> out[SIZE]; // output matrix

    void swap_first_last(int m[][SIZE]) {
        int rows = SIZE;
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                int t = m[0][j];
                m[0][j] = m[rows-1][j];
                m[rows-1][j] = t;
            }
        }
    }

    SC_CTOR(SwapFirstLast) {
        SC_METHOD(swap_first_last);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    void swap_first_last() {
        swap_first_last(in, out);
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we define a module called `SwapFirstLast` with two input and output ports of type `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<int>`, respectively. The module contains a function `swap_first_last` that takes a 2D integer array as a parameter and swaps the elements of the first and last rows. The function is called in the `swap_first_last` method, which is sensitive to the input port `in`.

The `SWAP_FIRST_LAST` macro is used to define a constant variable `rows` with the value of `SIZE`. The variable `t` is used to temporarily store the value of the element at the first row and current column index. The elements of the first and last rows are then swapped using the `t` variable.

In the main function, we create an object of the `SwapFirstLast` module and call its constructor, which initializes the input and output ports. We then call the `swap_first_last` function with the input and output matrices as parameters. The function will swap the elements of the first and last rows and output the result to the console.
