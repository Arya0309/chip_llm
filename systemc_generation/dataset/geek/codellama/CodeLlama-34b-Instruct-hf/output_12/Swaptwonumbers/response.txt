  **Inputs**:

* a: An integer variable representing the first number to be swapped.
* b: An integer variable representing the second number to be swapped.

**Outputs**:

* a: The first number, now swapped with the second number.
* b: The second number, now swapped with the first number.

**Major blocks of code**:

1. `main()`: This is the entry point of the program, where the swapping logic is implemented.
2. `cout`: These are lines of code that print messages to the console.
3. `temp`: This is a temporary variable used to store one of the numbers while the swapping is being performed.
4. `a = b;` and `b = temp;`: These are the lines of code that perform the swapping operation.

**Summary**:

The program starts by declaring the input variables `a` and `b` and printing their values to the console before the swapping operation. The program then performs the swapping operation by storing the value of `a` in `temp`, then assigning the value of `b` to `a`, and finally assigning the value of `temp` to `b`. The program then prints the new values of `a` and `b` to the console after the swapping operation.

**SystemC code snippet**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that swaps two integers
SC_MODULE(Swapper) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> out_a;  // Output port for the first number
    sc_out<int> out_b;  // Output port for the second number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Swapper) {
        // Process to perform swapping
        SC_METHOD(swap);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to perform the swapping
    void swap() {
        int temp;
        temp = a.read();
        a.write(b.read());
        b.write(temp);
        out_a.write(a.read());
        out_b.write(b.read());
    }
};
```
Note that in the SystemC code, we have two output ports (`out_a` and `out_b`) to reflect the two outputs of the original program. The `swap()` method performs the swapping operation by storing the value of `a` in `temp`, then assigning the value of `b` to `a`, and finally assigning the value of `temp` to `b`. The `out_a` and `out_b` output ports are then used to reflect the new values of `a` and `b`, respectively.
