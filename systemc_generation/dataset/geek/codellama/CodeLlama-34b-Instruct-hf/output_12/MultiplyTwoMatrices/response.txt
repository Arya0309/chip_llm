  The given C++/C code is a simple program that multiplies two matrices. The program has the following IOs:

* Inputs:
	+ mat1[][]: The first matrix to be multiplied
	+ mat2[][]: The second matrix to be multiplied
	+ R1: The number of rows in Matrix-1
	+ C1: The number of columns in Matrix-1
	+ R2: The number of rows in Matrix-2
	+ C2: The number of columns in Matrix-2
* Outputs:
	+ rslt[][]: The resulting matrix of the multiplication

The program has a function named `mulMat(mat1[][], mat2[][])` that takes two matrices as inputs and returns their product as an output. The function first initializes an empty matrix `rslt[][]` with the same dimensions as the product matrix. Then it iterates over the elements of the first matrix `mat1[][]` and for each element, it iterates over the elements of the second matrix `mat2[][]` to compute the dot product of the two matrices at that position. The dot product is stored in `rslt[][]` at the corresponding position. Finally, the function prints the resulting matrix `rslt[][]` to the console.

The main function simply calls the `mulMat` function with the test matrices `mat1[][]` and `mat2[][]`, and ensures that the matrices have the correct dimensions by checking the MACROs in the code.

Equivalent SystemC Code Snippet:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that multiplies two matrices
SC_MODULE(MatrixMultiplier) {
    // Input ports for the matrices
    sc_in<int> mat1[R1][C1];
    sc_in<int> mat2[R2][C2];

    // Output port for the result
    sc_out<int> result[R1][C2];

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatrixMultiplier) {
        // Process to perform matrix multiplication
        SC_METHOD(multiply);
        sensitive << mat1 << mat2;
    }

    // Method to multiply the matrices
    void multiply() {
        for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                result[i][j] = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < R2; k++) {
                    result[i][j] += mat1[i][k] * mat2[k][j];
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined a module that has input ports for the two matrices and an output port for the result of the multiplication. The constructor of the module declares a process that performs the matrix multiplication when the input matrices change. The process iterates over the elements of the first matrix and for each element, it iterates over the elements of the second matrix to compute the dot product of the two matrices at that position. The dot product is stored in the result matrix at the corresponding position.
