  **Inputs:**

* `Dividend`: the integer to be divided
* `Divisor`: the integer to divide by

**Outputs:**

* `Quotient`: the result of dividing `Dividend` by `Divisor`
* `Remainder`: the remainder of dividing `Dividend` by `Divisor`
* `Error`: an error flag to indicate if `Divisor` is zero

**Summary:**

The input to the program is `Dividend` and `Divisor`, which are read from the standard input stream `cin`. The program then performs the following operations:

1. Check if `Divisor` is equal to zero. If it is, the program prints an error message and terminates. Otherwise, it proceeds to step 2.
2. It computes the quotient and remainder of `Dividend` divided by `Divisor` using the `/` and `%` operators, respectively.
3. It prints the results of the computation, including the quotient and remainder.

**SystemC Equivalent:**

Here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that captures the logic of the original C++/C source code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Divider) {
    sc_in<int> dividend;  // Input port for the number to be divided
    sc_in<int> divisor;   // Input port for the divisor
    sc_out<int> quotient; // Output port for the quotient
    sc_out<int> remainder;// Output port for the remainder
    sc_out<bool> error;   // Output port for the error flag

    SC_CTOR(Divider) {
        SC_METHOD(divide);
        sensitive << dividend << divisor;
    }

    void divide() {
        if (divisor.read() == 0) {
            error.write(true);
        } else {
            quotient.write(dividend.read() / divisor.read());
            remainder.write(dividend.read() % divisor.read());
            error.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```
In this code snippet, we define a `Divider` module that has input and output ports for the dividend, divisor, quotient, remainder, and error flag. The `divide` method is sensitive to both input ports and performs the division and remainder calculation, setting the output ports accordingly. If the divisor is zero, the method sets the error flag to `true` and does not perform the division or remainder calculation.
