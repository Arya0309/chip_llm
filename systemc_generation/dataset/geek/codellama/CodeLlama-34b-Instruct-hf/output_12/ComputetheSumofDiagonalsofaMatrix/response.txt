  **Inputs and Outputs:**

* Inputs:
	+ `matrix[SIZE]`: A 2D array of integers representing a matrix.
	+ `principal` and `secondary`: Two output signals, each representing a diagonal sum of the input matrix.
* Outputs:
	+ `principal`: The sum of all elements on the principal diagonal of the input matrix.
	+ `secondary`: The sum of all elements on the secondary diagonal of the input matrix.

**Summary:**
The provided C++/C code calculates the sum of elements along the principal and secondary diagonals of a given matrix. The `matrix` array is passed as an input to the `printDiagonalSums` function, which iterates over the matrix and calculates the sum of elements along each diagonal. The `principal` and `secondary` output signals are then set to the calculated sums.

The `printDiagonalSums` function first initializes the `principal` and `secondary` variables to zero. Then, it iterates over the matrix using nested loops, each loop iterating over `n` elements. Inside the inner loop, the code checks if the current element is on either the principal or secondary diagonal. If it is, the sum of that diagonal is updated.

The updated sum of each diagonal is then printed to the console using `cout`. Finally, the `printDiagonalSums` function returns 0, indicating successful completion.

**SystemC Code:**

```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSums) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];
    sc_out<int> principal;
    sc_out<int> secondary;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSums) {
        // Process to calculate diagonal sums
        SC_METHOD(calDiagonalSums);
        sensitive << matrix;
    }

    // Method to calculate diagonal sums
    void calDiagonalSums() {
        int principal = 0, secondary = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                // Check if current element is on principal diagonal
                if (i == j) {
                    principal += matrix[i][j];
                }

                // Check if current element is on secondary diagonal
                if ((i + j) == (SIZE - 1)) {
                    secondary += matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
        }

        // Set output signals
        principal.write(principal);
        secondary.write(secondary);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `DiagonalSums` that has three ports: `matrix` is an input port for the matrix, `principal` and `secondary` are output ports for the diagonal sums.

The `calDiagonalSums` method is sensitive to changes in the `matrix` input port and calculates the sums of the elements on the principal and secondary diagonals. The sums are then written to the `principal` and `secondary` output ports, respectively.

Note that we have renamed the variables in the SystemC code to avoid conflicts with the corresponding named ports. Additionally, we have changed the loop bounds to reflect the size of the input matrix, which is passed as a parameter to the `calDiagonalSums` method.
