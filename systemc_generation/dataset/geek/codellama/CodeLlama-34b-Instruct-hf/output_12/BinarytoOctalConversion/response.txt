  **Inputs:**

* `octal_input`: an input signal that represents a binary number in octal format.
* `decimal_output`: an output signal that represents the decimal equivalent of the input octal number.

**Outputs:**

* `decimal_output`: the decimal equivalent of the input octal number.

**Code Analysis:**

The code is a C++ program that takes an integer input in octal format and converts it to its decimal equivalent. The program defines a function called `octalToDecimal` that accepts an integer input `n` and returns the decimal equivalent of `n` in octal format.

Inside the function, the code first assigns the input `n` to a new variable `num`, which is required for the conversion process. It then initializes two new variables: `dec_value` and `base`, which are used to store the decimal equivalent and the base value, respectively.

The code then enters a while loop that continues to execute until the input `num` is zero. Inside the loop, the code extracts the last digit of `num` using the modulo 10 operator (%). It then divides `num` by 10 using integer division and stores the result in `temp`.

The code then multiplies `last_digit` by `base` and adds the result to `dec_value`. Finally, it multiplies `base` by 8 to increase its value for the next digit of the octal number.

**SystemC Implementation:**
```c
// C++ program to convert octal to decimal using SystemC
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(OctalToDecimal) {
    // Input and output ports
    sc_in<int> octal_input;
    sc_out<int> decimal_output;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(OctalToDecimal) {
        // Declare a register to store the base value
        SC_MEMBER(int) base = 1;

        // Declare a register to store the current digit
        SC_MEMBER(int) digit = 0;

        // Declare a register to store the decimal value
        SC_MEMBER(int) dec = 0;

        // Process to perform the conversion
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << octal_input;
    }

    // Method to perform the conversion
    void convert() {
        // Initialize the base value
        base = 1;

        // Extract the last digit of the input number
        digit = octal_input.read() % 10;

        // Multiply the last digit by the base value and add it to the decimal value
        dec = 0;
        while (digit > 0) {
            dec += (digit * base);
            base *= 8;
            digit = (digit / 10) % 10;
        }

        // Calculate the decimal equivalent of the input number
        decimal_output.write(dec);
    }
};
```
In the above SystemC code, we have defined a module called `OctalToDecimal` that has two input and output ports: `octal_input` and `decimal_output`. The module also defines three register variables: `base`, `digit`, and `dec`.

The `OctalToDecimal` module is sensitive to the `octal_input` port, meaning that it will trigger the `convert` method whenever the input port is updated.

The `convert` method first initializes the `base` register to 1, which is the base value for an octal number. It then extracts the last digit of the input number by taking its modulo 10 value.

The method then enters a while loop that continues to execute as long as the `digit` register is greater than zero. Inside the loop, the method multiplies the `digit` register by the `base` register and adds the result to the `dec` register. It then updates the `base` register by multiplying it by 8 and updates the `digit` register by taking its modulo 10 value.

Once the while loop exits, the `convert` method calculates the decimal equivalent of the input number by simply dividing the `dec` register by 10. It then writes the result to the `decimal_output` port.

The SystemC code implemented above faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source code, while also utilizing the existing signals for testbench integration.
