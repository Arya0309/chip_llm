  **Assignment 1: C++/C to SystemC Conversion**

**Inputs:**

* `target`: The input value to be searched for in the vector
* `v`: The vector to be searched

**Outputs:**

* `found`: A flag indicating whether `target` was found in `v`

**Natural Language Summary:**

The given C++/C code implements an iterative binary search algorithm to search for a target value in a given vector. The search starts at the middle index of the vector and compares the value at that index with the target value. If the target value is found, the function returns `true`. If the target value is not found, the function returns `false`.

The line-by-line explanation of the code is as follows:

1. The `using namespace std;` directive is used to import all the standard library functions into the program.
2. The `binarySearch` function takes a vector `v` and an integer `target` as input. It initializes the low and high indices of the vector to be searched to 0 and the size of the vector minus 1, respectively.
3. The function enters a while loop that runs until the low index is greater than the high index.
4. Inside the loop, the function calculates the midpoint index using the low and high indices.
5. The function compares the value at the midpoint index with the target value. If they are equal, the function returns `true`.
6. If the value at the midpoint index is greater than the target value, the function updates the high index to be the midpoint minus 1.
7. If the value at the midpoint index is less than the target value, the function updates the low index to be the midpoint plus 1.
8. The function exits the while loop and returns `false` if the target value is not found.

**Equivalent SystemC Code:**

The following SystemC code performs the same logic as the C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinarySearch) {
    // Inputs
    sc_in<int> target;

    // Outputs
    sc_out<bool> found;

    // Vector to be searched
    sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinarySearch) {
        // Process to perform binary search
        SC_METHOD(search);
        sensitive << target << v;; // sensitivity list
    }

    void search() {
        // Initialize low and high indices
        int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;

        // Search for the target value
        while (low <= high) {
            // Calculate the midpoint index
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            // Compare the value at the midpoint index with the target value
            if (v[mid] == target) {
                found = true;
                break;
            }

            // Update the high or low index based on the comparison
            if (v[mid] > target) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        // Set found to false if the target value is not found
        found = false;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a `BinarySearch` module that takes the `target` value and the `v` vector as inputs, and returns `found` as an output. The module contains a `search` process that performs the binary search algorithm. The process is sensitive to `target` and `v`, so it will be triggered whenever either of these inputs changes.

Note that we use the `sc_vector` class to represent the vector `v`, which is a SystemC container for fixed-size arrays. This class provides an iterable interface, which allows us to iterate over the elements of the vector using a loop.
