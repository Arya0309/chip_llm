  Below is the natural language summary of the provided C++/C code and the equivalent SystemC code that conserves the code's operation:

**Inputs:**

* A 2D matrix with integer elements.
* The number of rows and columns in the 2D matrix.

**Outputs:**

* The sorted 2D matrix.

**C++/C Code Summary:**

The code starts off by including the necessary header file and defining necessary namespaces for any functions and variables. The swap function is then provided, which is a helper function for swapping the positions of two integers.

The sortRowWise function is provided next, which is the main sorting function. The sortRowWise function takes in a 2D integer array, the number of rows and the number of columns as arguments. The logic of this function is to loop through each row of the 2D array and sort its elements. It does this by swapping elements if necessary and moving on to the next row. 

Once the entire matrix is sorted, the sorted matrix is printed to the console. The C++ code ends with the main function, which defines an example 2D matrix of integers and calls the sortRowWise function to sort it.

**SystemC Code:**

```
CHIP Adder { 
    IN a,b; 
    OUT sum; 
    PORT clk; 
    PORT start; 
    PORT done; 
    METHOD sortRowWise;

    SC_METHOD(sortRowWise) 
    {
        while(true) 
        {
            if (done.read())
                break;
            for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                    if (m[i][j] > m[i][j + 1]) {
                        swap(m[i][j], m[i][j + 1]);
                    }
                }
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                    cout << Int(m[i][j]) << " ";
                }
                cout << endl;
            }
            done.write(true);
        }
        wait();
    }

    APPLICATION(Adder) {
        Adder adder("adder");
        adder.clk("clk");
        adder.start("start");
        adder.done("done");


}

CHI
 B "{
    Adder adder("adder");
    finish();
}";
```

The above code creates a SystemC module that performs the same functionality as the original C++/C code but with different syntax and includes. The code starts by creating an Adder class that includes 2 Input Ports (a and b), 1 Output Port (sum), 1 clock signal, 1 start signal, and 1 done signal.

The SystemC also has a sortRowWise method (which is the main method) that runs in a parallel process and loops through each row of the matrix and sorts its elements. Once the matrix is completely sorted, it prints out the matrix elements and sets the done signal to true. The method waits() until the done signal is set to true.

The main function creates an instance of the Adder class and connected input and output ports, as well as the clock and start signals. 

This is just one possible way to translate C++/C to SystemC. The translation is not exact, and different SystemC implementations do exist.
