  **Inputs:**

* `arr`: an integer array of size `n`
* `n`: the size of the `arr` array

**Outputs:**

* `Sorted array`: the sorted version of the input array `arr`

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code implements the selection sort algorithm. The code consists of three functions: `swap`, `selectionSort`, and `printArray`.

1. The `swap` function takes two integer pointers `xp` and `yp` as input and swaps the values pointed to by these pointers.
2. The `selectionSort` function takes an integer array `arr` and its size `n` as input. It sorts the array using the selection sort algorithm. The function first initializes the minimum index `min_idx` to 0, and then iterates over the array `n-1` times. In each iteration, it finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion. It then updates the minimum index and repeats this process `n-1` times. Finally, it prints the sorted array.
3. The `printArray` function takes an integer array `arr` and its size `n` as input and prints the array.

The main function reads an array of integers and assigns it to the variable `arr`. It then calculates the size of the array `n` and passes it to the `selectionSort` function. The `selectionSort` function sorts the array and prints the sorted array on the console.

**SystemC Equivalent Code:**

The following SystemC code implements the same functionality as the original C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SelectionSort) {
    // Inputs
    sc_in<int> *arr;  // Input array of integers
    sc_in<int> n;  // Size of the input array

    // Outputs
    sc_out<int> *sorted_arr;  // Output sorted array of integers

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SelectionSort) {
        // Process to sort the array
        SC_METHOD(selectionSort);
        sensitive << arr << n;
    }

    // Method to sort the array
    void selectionSort() {
        int min_idx = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            min_idx = i;
            for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) {
                    min_idx = j;
                }
            }
            swap(arr[min_idx], arr[i]);
        }
        sorted_arr.write(arr);
        cout << "Sorted array: ";
        printArray(sorted_arr, n);
    }

    // Method to print the sorted array
    void printArray(int *sorted_arr, int n) {
        cout << "Sorted array: ";
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cout << sorted_arr[i] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    // Method to swap two elements in the array
    void swap(int *xp, int *yp) {
        int temp = *xp;
        *xp = *yp;
        *yp = temp;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC implementation, we have defined a module `SelectionSort` that takes an input array `arr` of integers and its size `n` as input. The module has two output ports: `sorted_arr` and `sc_out<int> *sorted_arr`, which are used to store the sorted array and its size, respectively.

The `selectionSort` method is the heart of the module. It first initializes the minimum index `min_idx` to 0, and then iterates over the array `n-1` times. In each iteration, it finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion. It then updates the minimum index and repeats this process `n-1` times. Finally, it prints the sorted array using the `printArray` method.

The `printArray` method is called after sorting the array to print the sorted array. It prints the sorted array on the console.

The `swap` method is used to swap two elements in the array.

In this implementation, we have used the `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<int>` ports and the `sc_write<int>` and `sc_read<int>` methods to read and write to the input and output ports, respectively. We have also used the `sensitive << arr << n` to specify that the `selectionSort` method should be called whenever there is an update to the `arr` input port or the `n` input port.
