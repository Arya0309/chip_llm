  Inputs:

* `num`: An unordered array of integers to be sorted
* `len`: The length of the input array

Outputs:

* `num`: The sorted array

Explanation:

The provided code is a C++ program that implements the Bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The algorithm works by iterating through the array multiple times, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the array is sorted.

The `sort` function takes two inputs: the array of integers to be sorted (`num`) and its length (`len`). It uses a nested for-loop to iterate through the array. The outer loop iterates `len` times, and the inner loop iterates `len - i` times. Each iteration checks if the next element is smaller than the current one, and if it is, swaps them. The outer loop stops when no swaps are made in one iteration, indicating that the array is sorted.

The `swapNums` function is a helper function that swaps two elements in the array. It takes three inputs: the array of integers (`nums`), the index of the first element to be swapped (`first`), and the index of the second element to be swapped (`second`).

The `main` function is the driver code that initializes the array, calls the `sort` function, and prints the sorted array to the console.

SystemC Code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that sorts an array of integers using Bubble sort
SC_MODULE(BubbleSort) {
    sc_in<int> num[];  // Input port for the array of integers
    sc_in<int> len;  // Input port for the length of the array
    sc_out<int> sorted;  // Output port for the sorted array

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BubbleSort) {
        // Process to perform Bubble sort
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << num << len;
    }

    // Method to sort the array using Bubble sort
    void sort() {
        int curr, next;
        bool swapped = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < len - i; j++) {
                if (num[j] < num[j - 1]) {
                    curr = num[j];
                    num[j] = num[j - 1];
                    num[j - 1] = curr;
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }
            if (!swapped) {
                break;
            }
        }
        sorted.write(num);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module that takes an array of integers and its length as inputs and provides the sorted array as output. The `sort` method implements the Bubble sort algorithm to sort the input array. The process `sort` is sensitive to both the input array and its length. When any of these ports change, the `sort` method is called. The `sorted` output port is written with the sorted array when the sorting process is complete.
