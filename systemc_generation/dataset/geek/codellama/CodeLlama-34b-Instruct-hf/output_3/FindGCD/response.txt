  **Inputs:**

* `a`: integer
* `b`: integer

**Outputs:**

* `gcd_result`: integer

**C++/C Code Summary:**

The C++/C code defines a function `gcd` that takes two integer inputs `a` and `b` and returns an integer output `gcd_result`. The function finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using a simple arithmetic approach.

The function first finds the minimum of `a` and `b` using the `min` function from the `<algorithm>` library. This minimum value is stored in the variable `res`.

Next, the function enters a loop that starts at `res` and decrements it by 1 until it reaches 1. Inside the loop, the function checks if `a` and `b` are divisible by `res`. If they are, the loop breaks and `res` is returned as the GCD.

**SystemC Code Snippet:**
```c++
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(GCD) {
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;
    sc_out<int> gcd_result;

    SC_CTOR(GCD) {
        SC_METHOD(find_gcd);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    void find_gcd() {
        int res = min(a.read(), b.read());
        while (res > 1) {
            if (a.read() % res == 0 && b.read() % res == 0) {
                break;
            }
            res--;
        }
        gcd_result.write(res);
    }
};
```
**Explanation:**

The SystemC code snippet defines a `GCD` module that has two input ports `a` and `b`, and an output port `gcd_result`. The module contains a method `find_gcd` that computes the GCD of `a` and `b` using the same approach as the C++/C code.

The `find_gcd` method first finds the minimum of `a` and `b` using the `min` function from the `algorithm` library. This minimum value is stored in the variable `res`.

Next, the method enters a loop that starts at `res` and decrements it by 1 until it reaches 1. Inside the loop, the method checks if `a` and `b` are divisible by `res`. If they are, the loop breaks and `res` is returned as the GCD.

The `gcd_result` output port is written with the GCD value computed by the `find_gcd` method.

The module uses the `sc_in`, `sc_out`, and `sc_cte` types from the `systemc` library to define the input, output, and clock ports, respectively. The ` sensitive<<` syntax is used to specify which ports are sensitive to and which ports are controlled by the module.

The `SC_METHOD` macro is used to define a method for the `GCD` module, which is the entry point for the module's functionality. The `SC_CTOR` macro is used to define a constructor for the `GCD` module, which is used to initialize the module's input and output ports.
