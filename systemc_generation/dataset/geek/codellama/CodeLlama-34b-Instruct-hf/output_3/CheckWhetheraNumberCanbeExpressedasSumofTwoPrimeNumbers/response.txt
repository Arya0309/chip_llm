  **Inputs:**

* n: an integer to be checked for the possibility of expressing it as the sum of two prime numbers.

**Outputs:**

* result: a boolean value indicating whether the input integer can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

**Line-by-line Summary:**

1. The first line includes the necessary header files for the C++/C code.
2. The next line defines a function called `isPrime` that takes an integer argument `n` and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is prime or not.
3. The function uses a for-loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of `n`, and it checks if `n` is divisible by any integer within this range. If it is divisible, the function returns `false`.
4. The function returns `true` if `n` is not divisible by any integer within the range [2, sqrt(n)].
5. The `isPossible` function takes an integer argument `N` and returns a boolean value indicating whether `N` can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
6. The function first checks if `N` is prime using the `isPrime` function. If it is not prime, the function returns `false`.
7. If `N` is prime, the function checks if `N-2` is also prime. If it is, the function returns `true`.
8. If `N-2` is not prime, the function returns `false`.
9. The `main` function initializes an integer variable `n` with the value 13 and passes it to the `isPossible` function.
10. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PossibleSum) {
    sc_in<int> n_in; // Input port for the integer to check
    sc_out<bool> result_out; // Output port for the result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PossibleSum) {
        // Process to check if a prime number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers
        SC_METHOD(check);
        sensitive << n_in;
    }

    // Method to check if a prime number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers
    void check() {
        int n = n_in.read();
        bool result = false;

        // Check if n is prime
        if (isPrime(n)) {
            // Check if n-2 is also prime
            if (isPrime(n-2)) {
                result = true;
            }
        }

        result_out.write(result);
    }

    // Helper function to check if a number is prime
    bool isPrime(int n) {
        for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `PossibleSum` that has two ports: `n_in` for the input integer and `result_out` for the output boolean value indicating whether the input integer can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

The module has a single process `check` that is triggered by the input signal `n_in`. The process uses the `isPrime` function to check if `n` is prime and if `n-2` is also prime. If both conditions are true, then `result_out` is set to `true` indicating that the input integer can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

The `isPrime` function is a helper function that checks if a given number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if it is divisible by any integer within this range.
