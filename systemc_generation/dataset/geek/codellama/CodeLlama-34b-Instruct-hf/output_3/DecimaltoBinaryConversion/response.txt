  **Inputs:**

* `n`: A decimal number, passed as an argument to the `decToBinary` function

**Outputs:**

* Binary representation of `n` (printed to the console)

**Line-by-Line or Block-by-Block Explanation:**

The code is a C++ program that takes in a decimal number as input and prints its binary representation. The program consists of two parts: a `decToBinary` function and a driver code.

In the `decToBinary` function:

* We declare an integer array `binaryNum` of size 32, which will store the binary representation of `n`.
* We initialize a counter variable `i` to 0.
* We enter a while loop that continues until `n` is greater than 0.
* Inside the loop, we store the remainder obtained by dividing `n` by 2 in the `binaryNum` array at index `i`.
* We update `n` by dividing it by 2 and increment `i` to move to the next index of the array.
* After the loop, we print the binary representation of `n` by looping through the `binaryNum` array in reverse order and printing each index value.

In the driver code:

* We declare an integer variable `n` and assign it the value 10.
* We call the `decToBinary` function and pass `n` as the argument.
* The function returns nothing, so the driver code ends.

**SystemC Code:**

Here's an equivalent SystemC code snippet that implements the same logic as the given C++ code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DecToBinary) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;             // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out;        // Output port for the binary representation

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DecToBinary) {
        // Process to convert decimal to binary
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    // Method to convert decimal to binary
    void convert() {
        int binaryNum[32]; // Array to store binary representation
        int i = 0;         // Counter for binary array
        int n = dec_in.read(); // Copy of input decimal number for manipulation

        // While n is greater than 0, update binary array and n
        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }

        // Print binary representation in reverse order
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
        }
    }
};
```
In this code, we have two ports: `dec_in` for the decimal input, and `binary_out` for the binary representation output. We define a process that calls the `convert` method every time `dec_in` changes. Inside `convert`, we create a local array `binaryNum` to store the binary representation and a counter `i` to keep track of the index. We copy the input decimal number `n` into a local variable for manipulation.

We loop through the decimal number `n` using a while loop until it becomes 0, and update the `binaryNum` array at each step. After the loop, we print the binary representation in reverse order using `binary_out.write()`.

Note that we've used the `sc_out` port to print the binary representation, since it's the output port defined in the original code. If you need to print the result to the console, you can modify the code to use `cout` or `printf` instead.
