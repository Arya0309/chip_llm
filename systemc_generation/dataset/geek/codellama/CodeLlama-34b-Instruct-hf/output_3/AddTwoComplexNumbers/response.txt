  Inputs:

* real1: Real part of the first complex number
* imag1: Imaginary part of the first complex number
* real2: Real part of the second complex number
* imag2: Imaginary part of the second complex number

Outputs:

* real_sum: Real part of the sum of the two complex numbers
* imag_sum: Imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers

Explanation:
The provided code defines a class called "Complex" that has two member variables: "real" and "imaginary". The class also has a constructor and an "addComp" method that takes two Complex objects as inputs and returns the sum of the two complex numbers as a new Complex object.

In the "main" function, two Complex objects are created: C1 and C2. Their real and imaginary parts are initialized with the given values (3 and 2, and 9 and 5, respectively). Then, a temporary Complex object C3 is created, and the "addComp" method is called with C1 and C2 as inputs. The sum is stored in C3's "real" and "imaginary" member variables. Finally, the real and imaginary parts of the sum are printed to the console.

SystemC Code:

#include <systemc.h>

// Complex number class
struct Complex {
    int real;
    int imag;
    Complex(int r, int i) : real(r), imag(i) {}
};

// Complex adder module
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<Complex> in1, in2;
    sc_out<Complex> out;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << in1 << in2;
    }

    // Method to perform addition
    void add() {
        out.write(in1.read() + in2.read());
    }
};

int sc_main(int, char* []) {
    // Create inputs and outputs
    sc_signal<Complex> in1("in1");
    sc_signal<Complex> in2("in2");
    sc_signal<Complex> out("out");

    // Create the adder module
    ComplexAdder adder("adder");
    adder.in1(in1);
    adder.in2(in2);
    adder.out(out);

    // Set input values
    in1.write(Complex(3, 2));
    in2.write(Complex(9, 5));

    // Wait for the result
    sc_start(100, SC_NS);

    // Print the output
    std::cout << "Sum: " << out.read().real << " + i" << out.read().imag << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
