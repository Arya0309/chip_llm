  Matrix Multiplication in C++
==========================

The provided C++ code is a program that multiplies two matrices using the SystemC library. The program defines two matrices `mat1` and `mat2`, with dimensions specified by the user through the `#define` statements at the beginning of the code. The program then multiplies these two matrices using nested loops and displays the result.

Inputs:

* `mat1`: The first matrix to be multiplied, represented by an array of integers with dimensions specified by the user through the `#define` statements.
* `mat2`: The second matrix to be multiplied, represented by an array of integers with dimensions specified by the user through the `#define` statements.

Outputs:

* `rslt`: The result of multiplying `mat1` and `mat2`, represented by an array of integers with dimensions specified by the user through the `#define` statements.

Function `mulMat`:
-------------------

The `mulMat` function takes two matrices `mat1` and `mat2` and multiplies them using nested loops. The function first initializes a new matrix `rslt` with the same dimensions as `mat1` and `mat2`, and then performs the matrix multiplication. The result is stored in `rslt`.

The function first iterates over the rows of `mat1` using a loop, and then iterates over the columns of `mat2` using another loop. The function then performs the multiplication of the elements of `mat1` and `mat2` using a third loop, and stores the result in the corresponding element of `rslt`.

The function then prints out the result of the multiplication, and returns.

Driver code:
------------

The driver code first defines two matrices `mat1` and `mat2` with dimensions specified by the user through the `#define` statements. The code then checks whether the number of columns in `mat1` is equal to the number of rows in `mat2`. If this condition is not met, the code prints an error message and exits.

The driver code then calls the `mulMat` function to multiply the two matrices, and prints the result.

SystemC code:
-------------

To generate an equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow, we can define a `MatrixMultiplier` module that takes two matrices as inputs and returns the result of multiplying them.
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module for matrix multiplication
SC_MODULE(MatrixMultiplier) {
    sc_in<sc_fixed<32, 32>> A[SIZE_A];
    sc_in<sc_fixed<32, 32>> B[SIZE_B];
    sc_out<sc_fixed<32, 32>> C;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatrixMultiplier) {
        // Process to perform matrix multiplication
        SC_METHOD(multiply);
        sensitive << A << B << C;
    }

    // Method to multiply the matrices
    void multiply() {
        // Initialize the result matrix
        sc_fixed<32, 32> rslt[SIZE_RESULT];

        // Multiply the matrices
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE_A; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE_B; j++) {
                rslt[i][j] = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < SIZE_A; k++) {
                    rslt[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
                }
            }
        }

        // Store the result in the output port
        C.write(rslt);
    }
};
```
The `MatrixMultiplier` module takes two input ports for the matrices `A` and `B`, and an output port for the result `C`. The module defines a method `multiply` that performs the matrix multiplication using nested loops. The method initializes the result matrix, and then performs the multiplication using the same logic as the C++ code. Finally, the method stores the result in the output port `C`.

The `main` function can then be used to test the `MatrixMultiplier` module using the `sc_main` macro:
```scss
int sc_main() {
    // Define the matrices
    sc_fixed<32, 32> A[SIZE_A] = { { 1, 1 }, { 2, 2 } };
    sc_fixed<32, 32> B[SIZE_B] = { { 1, 1, 1 }, { 2, 2, 2 } };

    // Instantiate the module
    MatrixMultiplier mul(A, B, C);

    // Run the simulation
    sc_start();

    return 0;
}
```
The `main` function defines the matrices `A` and `B` with the same dimensions as the original C++ code, and then instantiates the `MatrixMultiplier` module with these matrices. The function then runs the simulation using the `sc_start` macro.
