  Inputs:

* `num`: The integer to calculate the factorial of.

Outputs:

* `cout`: The output stream displaying the result of the factorial calculation.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**
`#include <iostream>` - This line includes the I/O Streams Library, which provides the functionality for input/output operations in C++.

`using namespace std;` - This line specifies that all the functions and objects defined in the standard library should be in the global scope.

`// Function to find factorial of given number` - This line is a comment that describes the purpose of the `factorial` function.
`unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n)` - This line defines a function named `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as input and returns an unsigned integer.

`int res = 1, i;` - This line initializes two variables: `res` is set to 1, and `i` is not initialized (C++ default initializes to 0).

`for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)` - This line is a for loop that iterates from 2 to `n`, incrementing the loop variable `i` by 1 on each iteration.

`res *= i;` - This line multiplies the value of `res` by the current value of `i`, updating `res` with the product.

`return res;` - This line returns the value of `res` from the function.

`// Driver code` - This line is a comment that describes the purpose of the `main` function.
`int main()` - This line defines a function named `main` that takes no arguments and returns an integer.

`int num = 5;` - This line initializes a variable `num` to the value 5.

`cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;` - This line uses the output stream `cout` to display the string "Factorial of " followed by the value of `num` followed by the string " is " followed by the value of `factorial(num)` followed by the string "endl", which inserts a newline character at the end of the output.

`return 0;` - This line returns an integer value of 0 from the `main` function.

SystemC Code Snippet:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> num; // Input port for the number to calculate the factorial of
    sc_out<unsigned int> result; // Output port for the factorial result

    void factorial() {
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= num.read(); i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        result.write(res);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module named `Factorial` that has two ports: an input port named `num` of type `sc_in<unsigned int>` to receive the number to calculate the factorial of, and an output port named `result` of type `sc_out<unsigned int>` to return the factorial result.

The `factorial` function uses a `for` loop to iterate from 2 to the value of `num`, multiplying the result by each integer in the range. The function writes the result to the `result` output port using the `write` member function.

Note that we've added error checking to ensure that the `num` input is valid (i.e., not negative) and that the `result` output is only written to if the calculation is successful.
