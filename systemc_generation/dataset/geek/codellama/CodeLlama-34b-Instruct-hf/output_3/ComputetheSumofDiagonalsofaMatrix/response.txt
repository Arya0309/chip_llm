  **Inputs:**

* `mat[][]`: a 2D array of integers representing a square matrix
* `n`: an integer representing the size of the matrix

**Outputs:**

* `principal`: the sum of the elements in the principal diagonal of the matrix
* `secondary`: the sum of the elements in the secondary diagonal of the matrix

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code defines a function `printDiagonalSums(mat, n)` that takes in a 2D array of integers representing a square matrix and its size as input. The function calculates and prints the sum of the elements in the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix.

The function first initializes two integers, `principal` and `secondary`, to 0. It then iterates through each row of the matrix using a nested loop, and for each element in the row, it checks whether the element is in the principal diagonal or the secondary diagonal. If the element is in the principal diagonal, it adds its value to `principal`. If the element is in the secondary diagonal, it adds its value to `secondary`.

After iterating through all the elements in the matrix, the function prints the values of `principal` and `secondary` to the console.

**SystemC Code:**

Here is a SystemC code snippet that captures the same logic as the provided C++/C code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSums) {
    sc_in<int> mat[SIZE][SIZE];
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<int> principal;
    sc_out<int> secondary;

    void calculateSums() {
        int principal = 0;
        int secondary = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == j) {
                    principal += mat[i][j];
                }
                if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) {
                    secondary += mat[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        principal.write(principal);
        secondary.write(secondary);
    }

    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSums) {
        calculateSums();
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `DiagonalSums` that takes in a 2D array of integers `mat[SIZE][SIZE]` and its size `n` as input. The module has two output ports, `principal` and `secondary`, which give the sum of the elements in the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix.

The `calculateSums()` method iterates through the matrix in the same way as the C++/C code, and computes the sum of the elements in the principal and secondary diagonals. The results are then written to the output ports using the `write()` method.

The `SC_CTOR` macro is used to create a constructor for the module that calls the `calculateSums()` method. This ensures that the module computes the sums of the diagonals when it is instantiated.
