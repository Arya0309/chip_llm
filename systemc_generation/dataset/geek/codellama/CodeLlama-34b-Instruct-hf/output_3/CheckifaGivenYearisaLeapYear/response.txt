  **Inputs:**

* `year`: An integer value representing the year to be checked.

**Outputs:**

* `is_leap_year`: A boolean value indicating whether the input year is a leap year (true) or not (false).

**Code Summary:**

The provided C++/C code defines a function named `checkYear` that takes an integer `year` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input year is a leap year or not. The function uses a series of `if` statements to check the input year against various conditions:

1. If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
2. If the year is not divisible by 100, it is a leap year.
3. If the year is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year.
4. Otherwise, it is not a leap year.

The function then returns the result of the check using the ternary operator (?:).

In the `main()` function, the function is called with an input year of 2000, and the result is printed to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks if a given year is a leap year
SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    // Input port for the year to be checked
    sc_in<int> year;
    // Output port for the check result
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
        // Process to check the year
        SC_METHOD(checkYear);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    // Method to check if the year is a leap year
    void checkYear() {
        // Check if the year is divisible by 400
        if (year.read() % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        }
        // Check if the year is divisible by 100 but not by 400
        else if (year.read() % 100 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
        // Check if the year is divisible by 4
        else if (year.read() % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        }
        // Otherwise, it is not a leap year
        else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```
In the above SystemC code, we define a module named `LeapYearChecker` with input and output ports for the year to be checked and the result of the check, respectively. The `checkYear` method is defined inside the module, which checks the input year against the same conditions as the original C++/C code and updates the output port accordingly. The module is instantiated in the testbench to perform the check and the result is then available on the `is_leap_year` output port.
