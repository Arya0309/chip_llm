  Inputs:

* `target`: An integer to be searched for in the vector
* `v`: A vector of integers to search

Outputs:

* `found`: A boolean indicating whether the `target` was found in the vector

Line-by-line summary:

1. The `binarySearch` function takes a vector of integers `v` and an integer `target` as input.
2. The function first initializes two integer variables, `low` and `high`, to the beginning and end of the vector `v`, respectively.
3. The function then enters a `while` loop that continues until `low` is greater than `high`.
4. In each iteration of the loop, the function calculates the midpoint of the current range (from `low` to `high`) and assigns it to the variable `mid`.
5. The function then compares the value of `v[mid]` with `target`. If they are equal, the function returns `true`.
6. If `v[mid]` is greater than `target`, the function sets `high` to `mid - 1` to narrow the search range.
7. If `v[mid]` is less than `target`, the function sets `low` to `mid + 1` to narrow the search range.
8. If the search range is empty (i.e., `low` is greater than `high`), the function returns `false`.

Equivalent SystemC code:

```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinarySearch) {
    sc_in<int> target;
    sc_in<bool> found;
    sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinarySearch) {
        // Process to perform binary search
        SC_METHOD(search);
        sensitive << target << v;
    }

    // Method to perform binary search
    void search() {
        // Initialize search range
        int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;

        // Iteratively search the array
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (v[mid].read() == target.read()) {
                found.write(true);
                return;
            } else if (v[mid].read() > target.read()) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        // If the search range is empty, set found to false
        found.write(false);
    }
};
```
Note: In the SystemC code, I used `v[mid].read()` to access the value of the `v` vector at the index `mid`, and `target.read()` to read the value of the `target` signal. I also used `found.write(bool)` to write the `found` output signal. The module's constructor and the `search` method are sensitive to changes in the input signals `target` and `v`.
