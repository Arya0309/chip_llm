  **Functionality**: The provided C++/C code is a simple program that takes a square matrix of integers as input, and outputs the sum of the elements on the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix. The input matrix consists of four rows and four columns, and the output consists of two integers that represent the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively.

**Inputs**:

1. `mat`: A square matrix of integers with four rows and four columns.
2. `n`: The number of rows and columns in the matrix.

**Outputs**:

1. `principal`: The sum of the elements on the principal diagonal of the matrix.
2. `secondary`: The sum of the elements on the secondary diagonal of the matrix.

**Summary**:
The program defines a function `printDiagonalSums` that takes an integer matrix and its size as input, and outputs the sum of the elements on the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix. The function first declares two integer variables, `principal` and `secondary`, and initializes them to zero. It then iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix using nested for loops. For each element in the matrix, the function checks whether it is located on the principal diagonal (i.e., `i == j`) or the secondary diagonal (i.e., `i + j == n - 1`). If an element is located on either diagonal, the function adds it to the corresponding sum variable. After iterating over all elements in the matrix, the function outputs the values of `principal` and `secondary`.

**SystemC Code**:

Here is an equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic of the C++/C code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSums) {
    // Input ports
    sc_in<sc_int<10>> mat[4][4];
    sc_in<sc_int<10>> n;

    // Output ports
    sc_out<sc_int<10>> principal;
    sc_out<sc_int<10>> secondary;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSums) {
        // Process to compute diagonal sums
        SC_METHOD(findDiagonalSums);
        sensitive << mat << n;
    }

    // Method to compute diagonal sums
    void findDiagonalSums() {
        int i, j, principal = 0, secondary = 0;
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // Condition for principal diagonal
                if (i == j) {
                    principal += mat[i][j];
                }
                // Condition for secondary diagonal
                if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) {
                    secondary += mat[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        principal.write(principal);
        secondary.write(secondary);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the module `DiagonalSums` declares four input ports for the matrix `mat` and the size `n`, and two output ports for the principal and secondary diagonal sums. The module also declares two integer variables `principal` and `secondary`, which are used to store the sums of the elements on the respective diagonals. The constructor for the module defines a process `findDiagonalSums` that is sensitive to changes in the input ports `mat` and `n`, and calls the method `findDiagonalSums`. The method iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix, and uses the same logic as the C++/C code to compute the sum of the elements on the principal and secondary diagonals. Finally, the method writes the computed sums to the output ports.

Note that in this SystemC code, we use the `sc_int<10>` data type to represent the integers in the matrix. This data type is a built-in SystemC data type that represents an integer with a precision of 10 bits. We use this data type to ensure that the accuracy of the sums is preserved during simulation.
