  Inputs:

* `v`: a vector of integers
* `key`: an integer to be searched in the vector

Outputs:

* `i`: the position of the key in the vector, or -1 if the key is not found

Explanation:

The code defines a function `linearSearch` that takes a vector and an integer key as inputs. The function iterates through the vector and checks if each element is equal to the key. If the key is found, the function returns the position of the key in the vector. If the key is not found, the function returns -1. The main function calls the `linearSearch` function with a vector `v` and an integer key `key`. The `linearSearch` function searches the key in the vector and returns the position of the key if it is found. If the key is not found, the `linearSearch` function returns -1. The main function checks if the returned value is not -1, which means the key is found, and prints a message indicating the key is found and its position in the vector.

SystemC Code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LinearSearch) {
    sc_in<int> key;  // Input port for the key to be searched
    sc_in<int> index;  // Output port for the position of the key
    sc_vector<sc_in<int> > data;  // Input port for the vector

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LinearSearch) {
        // Process to perform linear search
        SC_METHOD(linearSearch);
        sensitive << key << data;
    }

    // Method to perform linear search
    void linearSearch() {
        for (int i = 0; i < data.size(); i++) {
            if (data[i] == key) {
                index.write(i);
                return;
            }
        }
        index.write(-1);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `LinearSearch` module has three input ports: `key`, `index`, and `data`. The `key` input port is used to receive the key to be searched, the `index` output port is used to return the position of the key in the vector, and the `data` input port is used to receive the vector. The `LinearSearch` module performs a linear search on the `data` input port using the `key` input port. If the key is found, the `linearSearch` method writes the position of the key to the `index` output port. If the key is not found, the `linearSearch` method writes -1 to the `index` output port. The `LinearSearch` module is sensitive to changes in the `key` and `data` input ports.
