**Code Summary:**

The function `rotatematrix` takes three inputs: `R`, `C`, and `a`, which are the number of rows, columns, and the matrix to be rotated, respectively. The function first initializes a few variables: `row`, `col`, `prev`, and `curr`.

The function then enters a while loop that iterates while `row` is less than `m` (which is set to `R` at the beginning of the function) and `col` is less than `n` (which is set to `C` at the beginning of the function).

Inside the while loop, the function first checks if `row + 1 == m` or `col + 1 == n`. If either of these conditions are true, the function exits the loop.

Next, the function stores the first element of the next row in the `prev` variable. It then moves the elements of the first row from the remaining rows, replacing the first element of each row with the next element in the row. This is done by iterating over the columns from `col` to `n-1`, assigning the current element to `curr` and the next element to `prev`, and then assigning the current element to the next element.

Next, the function moves the elements of the last column from the remaining columns. This is done by iterating over the rows from `row` to `m-1`, assigning the current element to `curr` and the next element to `prev`, and then assigning the current element to the next element.

Next, the function decrements `m` and `n` by 1.

The function then checks if `row < m` and if so, it moves the elements of the last row from the remaining rows. This is done by iterating over the columns from `n-1` to `col` in reverse order, assigning the current element to `curr` and the next element to `prev`, and then assigning the current element to the next element.

The function then checks if `col < n` and if so, it moves the elements of the first column from the remaining columns. This is done by iterating over the rows from `m-1` to `row` in reverse order, assigning the current element to `curr` and the next element to `prev`, and then assigning the current element to the next element.

Finally, the function increments `col` by 1.

The function then prints the rotated matrix.

            if (row + 1 == R || col + 1 == C) {
                break;
            }

            prev = in[row + 1][col];

            // Move elements of first row from remaining rows
            for (int i = col; i < C; i++) {
                curr = in[row][i];
                in[row][i] = prev;
                prev = curr;
            }

            row++;

            // Move elements of last column from remaining columns
            for (int i = row; i < R; i++) {
                curr = in[i][C - 1];
                in[i][C - 1] = prev;
                prev = curr;
            }

            C--;

            // Move elements of last row from remaining rows
            if (row < R) {
                for (int i = C - 1; i >= col; i--) {
                    curr = in[R - 1][i];
                    in[R - 1][i] = prev;
                    prev = curr;
                }
            }

            R--;

            // Move elements of first column from remaining columns
            if (col < C) {
                for (int i = R - 1; i >= row; i--) {
                    curr = in[i][col];
                    in[i][col] = prev;
                    prev = curr;
                }
            }

            col++;
        }

        // Print rotated matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < R; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C; j++) {
                out[i][j] = in[i][j];
            }
        }

In this SystemC code, we have a module called `RotateMatrix` that takes an input port `in` of size `SIZE` and an output port `out` of size `SIZE`. The module has a single method `rotate` that performs the rotation of the matrix. The method first initializes the variables `row`, `col`, `prev`, and `curr`. It then enters a while loop that iterates while `row` is less than `R` and `col` is less than `C`.

Inside the while loop, the method first checks if `row + 1 == R` or `col + 1 == C`. If either of these conditions are true, the method exits the loop.

Next, the method stores the first element of the next row in the `prev` variable. It then moves the elements of the first row from the remaining rows, replacing the first element of each row with the next element in the row. This is done by iterating over the columns from `col` to `C-1`, assigning the current element to `curr` and the next element to `prev`, and then assigning the current element to the next element.

Next, the method moves the elements of the last column from the remaining columns. This is done by iterating over the rows from `row` to `R-1`, assigning the current element to `curr` and the next element to `prev`, and then assigning the current element to the next element.

Next, the method decrements `R` and `C` by 1.

The method then checks if `row < R` and if so, it moves the elements of the last row from the remaining rows. This is done by iterating over the columns from `C-1` to `col` in reverse order, assigning the current element to `curr` and the next element to `prev`, and then assigning the current element to the next element.

The method then checks if `col < C` and if so, it moves the elements of the first column from the remaining columns. This is done by iterating over the rows from `R-1` to `row` in reverse order, assigning the current element to `curr` and the next element to `prev`, and then assigning the current element to the next element.

Finally, the method increments `col` by 1.

The method then prints the rotated matrix by iterating over the rows and columns and assigning the value of the corresponding element in the input port `in` to the corresponding element in the output port `out`.
