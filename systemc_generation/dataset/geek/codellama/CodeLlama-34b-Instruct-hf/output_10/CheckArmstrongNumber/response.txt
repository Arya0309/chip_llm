  C++/C Code:
```
// C++ program to implement the approach
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Driver code
int main()
{
    // Input variable
    int n = 153;

    // Temporary variable to store the input
    int temp = n;

    // Variable to store the result
    int p = 0;

    // Loop to calculate the sum of individual digits
    while (n > 0) {
        int rem = n % 10;
        p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
        n = n / 10;
    }

    // Check if the result equals the input
    if (temp == p) {
        cout << "Yes. It is Armstrong No.";
    }
    else {
        cout << "No. It is not an Armstrong No.";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Inputs:

* `n`: The input number.

Outputs:

* `p`: The sum of the cube of each digit in the input number.
* The message "Yes. It is Armstrong No." or "No. It is not an Armstrong No."

Explanation:

The program first declares three variables: `n`, `temp`, and `p`. The input (`n`) is provided as 153. The program then stores the input value in `temp` before starting the calculation.

The program then enters a while loop, which goes on until the value of `n` is less than or equal to 0. Inside the loop, the program calculates the sum of the cube of each digit of the input number (`n`). This is done by first calculating the remainder of `n` divided by 10 (`rem`). `rem` is then multiplied by itself (`rem * rem`) and the result is added to `p` (`p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem)`). The program then divides `n` by 10 (`n = n / 10`), effectively removing the most significant digit of the number, and starts again with the updated `n`.

Once the loop exits, the program checks if the input number is equal to the calculated `p`, if so, it prints "Yes. It is Armstrong No." to the console. If not, it prints "No. It is not an Armstrong No."

SystemC Code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE (ArmstrongChecker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongChecker) {
        SC_METHOD(checkNumber);
        sensitive << num_in;
    }

    void checkNumber() {
        int n = num_in.read();
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        is_armstrong.write((temp == p) ? true : false);
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we define a module called `ArmstrongChecker` with two ports: `num_in` and `is_armstrong`. The module has one method, `checkNumber` which is triggered by any change to `num_in`. The method performs the same calculation as the C++/C code and writes the result to `is_armstrong`.

Note that the variable names have been changed to make them consistent with the SystemC signal naming conventions. Also, the `is_armstrong` signal is defined as a boolean, whereas in the C++/C code, it is defined as an integer.
