  **Inputs**:

1. `real1`: Real part of the first complex number
2. `imag1`: Imaginary part of the first complex number
3. `real2`: Real part of the second complex number
4. `imag2`: Imaginary part of the second complex number

**Outputs**:

1. `real_sum`: Real part of the sum of the two complex numbers
2. `imag_sum`: Imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers

**Logic**:

The program defines a `Complex` class that represents a complex number with `real` and `imaginary` parts. The `addComp` method takes two `Complex` objects as input and returns a new `Complex` object that is the sum of the two input complex numbers.

The `main` function creates two `Complex` objects, `C1` and `C2`, and uses the `addComp` method to compute the sum of the two complex numbers. The result is stored in `C3`, and its real and imaginary parts are printed to the console.

**SystemC Code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;
    sc_in<int> imag1;
    sc_in<int> real2;
    sc_in<int> imag2;
    sc_out<int> real_sum;
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;

    void addComp(int a_real, int a_imag, int b_real, int b_imag, int& sum_real, int& sum_imag) {
        sum_real = a_real + b_real;
        sum_imag = a_imag + b_imag;
    }

    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(addComp);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined a `ComplexAdder` module that takes the `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, `real_sum`, and `imag_sum` signals as input. The `addComp` method takes the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers as input and writes the sum of the two complex numbers to the `real_sum` and `imag_sum` signals.

The `SC_METHOD` process is sensitive to the input signals `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`. Whenever any of these signals changes, the `addComp` method is triggered, and the sum of the two complex numbers is computed and written to the output signals.
