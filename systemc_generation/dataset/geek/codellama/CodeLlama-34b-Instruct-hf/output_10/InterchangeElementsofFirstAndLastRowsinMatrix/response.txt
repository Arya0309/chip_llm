  **Input:**
The input to the C++/C code is a 2D integer array of size 4x4, denoted as `m`. The array is defined in the main function as follows:
```
int m[4][4] = {{8, 9, 7, 6}, {4, 7, 6, 5}, {3, 2, 1, 8}, {9, 9, 7, 7}};
```

**Output:**
The output of the C++/C code is the modified 2D integer array `m`, where the elements of the first and last columns have been swapped. The modified array is then printed to the console using a nested for loop.

**Line-by-Line Description:**
The code begins by including the header file `iostream` for input and output operations and defining the size of the 2D array `n` as 4. The function `interchangeFirstLast` is defined outside the main function. It takes a 2D integer array `m` of size `n x n` as input and swaps the elements of the first and last columns. The function first declares two integer variables `i` and`n` and initializes them to 0 and `n-1` respectively. It then enters a for loop that iterates `n` times, where `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

Inside the for loop, the function declares two more integer variables `t` and `m[i][0]` and assigns `m[i][0]` to `t`. It then assigns `m[i][n-1]` to `m[i][0]` and `t` to `m[i][n-1]`. This swaps the elements of the first and last columns of the array.

The main function begins by defining a 2D integer array `m` of size `n x n` and initializing its values. It then calls the function `interchangeFirstLast` with `m` as input. Finally, it enters a nested for loop that iterates `n x n` times, where it prints the elements of the modified 2D array `m` to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
Based on the above C++/C code, the following SystemC code can be generated that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(InterchangeFirstLast) {
    // Input port for the 2D integer array
    sc_in<sc_int<32> > m;

    // Output port for the modified 2D integer array
    sc_out<sc_int<32> > out;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(InterchangeFirstLast) {
        // Process to perform the swap
        SC_METHOD(interchangeFirstLast);
        sensitive << m;
    }

    // Method to swap the elements of the first and last columns
    void interchangeFirstLast() {
        int n = m.size();
        int t = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            t = m[i][0];
            m[i][0] = m[i][n - 1];
            m[i][n - 1] = t;
        }
        out.write(m);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined a module `InterchangeFirstLast` that has an input port `m` for the 2D integer array and an output port `out` for the modified 2D integer array. The module has a process `interchangeFirstLast` that performs the swap of the elements of the first and last columns of the input array.

The process `interchangeFirstLast` first gets the size of the 2D array `n` and declares two integer variables `t` and `m[i][0]`. It then enters a for loop that iterates `n` times, where `t` is assigned `m[i][0]` and `m[i][n-1]` is assigned `m[i][0]`. The process then writes the modified 2D array `m` to the output port `out`.

The module `InterchangeFirstLast` is then instantiated in the main function, where the input array is defined and passed as input to the module. The modified array is then read from the output port `out` and printed to the console.
```
int main() {
    // Input array
    sc_int<32> m[4][4] = {{8, 9, 7, 6}, {4, 7, 6, 5}, {3, 2, 1, 8}, {9, 9, 7, 7}};

    // Instantiate the module
    InterchangeFirstLast mod(m, out);

    // Print the modified array
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
            cout << m[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
