  **Inputs:**

* `n`: The decimal number to be converted to binary.

**Outputs:**

* `binaryNum`: The binary representation of `n`.

**Summary:**

The provided C++ code defines a function `decToBinary(int n)` that takes a single integer input `n` and converts it to a binary representation. The function first initializes an integer array `binaryNum` of size 32 and a counter `i` to 0. Then, it enters a loop that repeatedly divides `n` by 2 and stores the remainder in `binaryNum[i]`. The loop terminates when `n` is equal to 0. Finally, the function prints the binary representation of `n` in reverse order.

The `main()` function is a simple driver function that calls `decToBinary(10)` to convert the number 10 to binary.

**SystemC Equivalent:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DecimalToBinary) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in; // Input port for decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for binary representation

    void decToBinary() {
        int binaryNum[32];
        int i = 0;
        while (dec_in.read() > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = dec_in.read() % 2;
            dec_in.write(dec_in.read() / 2);
            i++;
        }
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
        }
    }

    SC_CTOR(DecimalToBinary) {
        SC_METHOD(decToBinary);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }
};
```
In the above SystemC code, we have defined a module `DecimalToBinary` that takes in a single integer input `dec_in` and an integer output `binary_out`. The module contains a single method `decToBinary()` that performs the conversion from decimal to binary. The method uses the same logic as the original C++ function, but in a SystemC-compliant form. The module is sensitive to changes in the input `dec_in`.

Note that we have used the signals `dec_in` and `binary_out` that were provided in the problem statement. This is necessary for the module to integrate seamlessly with our existing testbench.
