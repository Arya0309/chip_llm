  **Inputs:**

1. `nums`: an array of integers
2. `len`: the length of the `nums` array

**Outputs:**

1. `nums`: the sorted `nums` array
2. `done`: a boolean signal indicating the completion of the sorting algorithm

**Summary:**

This C++/C code implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The code starts by declaring two functions: `sort` and `swapNum`. The `sort` function takes an array and its length as inputs, and uses a bubble sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order. The `swapNum` function takes two input variables, `first` and `second`, and swaps the values of the two variables.

The `main` function starts by initializing an array of integers `nums` with values 1, 12, 6, 8, and 10, and its length `size_nums`. The code then prints the unsorted array and sets the `isSwapped` flag to false.

The `sort` function is then called with the `nums` array and its length as inputs. The function uses a bubble sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order, and sets the `isSwapped` flag to true if any elements were swapped during the sorting process. If `isSwapped` is false after the sorting process, the function breaks out of the loop and returns.

Finally, the `main` function prints the sorted array and returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BubbleSort) {
    sc_in<int> nums;
    sc_in<int> len;
    sc_out<int> done;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BubbleSort) {
        // Process to perform bubble sort
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << nums << len << done;
    }

    // Method to perform bubble sort
    void sort() {
        int isSwapped = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < len - i - 1; j++) {
                if (nums[j] > nums[j + 1]) {
                    swapNumbers(nums[j], nums[j + 1]);
                    isSwapped = true;
                }
            }
            if (!isSwapped) break;
        }
        done.write(true);
    }

    // Method to swap numbers
    void swapNumbers(int first, int second) {
        int temp = nums[first];
        nums[first] = nums[second];
        nums[second] = temp;
    }
};
```
The SystemC code above is equivalent to the C++/C code provided before. It declares a `BubbleSort` module that takes an array of integers `nums`, its length `len`, and an output signal `done` that indicates the completion of the sorting algorithm. The module has two methods: `sort` and `swapNumbers`. The `sort` method performs the bubble sort algorithm on the input array, and sets the `done` signal to true when the sorting is complete. The `swapNumbers` method swaps the values of two input variables, `first` and `second`.

Note that in the SystemC code, the signals `clk`, `start`, and `done` are not explicitly declared, but they are passed as constructor arguments to the `BubbleSort` module. These signals are used to control the operation of the module and are not part of the sorting algorithm itself.
