  Inputs:

* `binary_in`: A binary value to be converted to decimal.

Outputs:

* `decimal_out`: The decimal equivalent of the binary input.

Functionality:

* The code takes in a binary value as input and converts it to a decimal value using a simple base conversion algorithm.
* The function first initializes a temporary variable `temp` to the input value.
* The function then iterates through the digits of the binary number, from right to left, using a while loop.
* In each iteration, the function extracts the last digit of the temporary value using the modulo operator (`% 10`) and stores it in a variable called `last_digit`.
* The function then divides the temporary value by 10 using integer division (`/ 10`) to remove the last digit.
* The function multiplies `last_digit` by the current base value, which starts at 1 and is incremented by 2 in each iteration. This gives the decimal equivalent of the last digit.
* The function then adds the decimal equivalent of the last digit to the running total, which is initialized to 0 before the loop.
* The function returns the running total, which is the decimal equivalent of the binary input.

SystemC Code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinaryToDecimal) {
  sc_in<int> binary_in;  // Input port for binary value
  sc_out<int> decimal_out;  // Output port for decimal value

  void convert() {
    int binary = binary_in.read();
    int decimal = 0;
    int base = 1;
    while (binary) {
      int last_digit = binary % 10;
      decimal += last_digit * base;
      base *= 2;
      binary = binary / 10;
    }
    decimal_out.write(decimal);
  }

  SC_CTOR(BinaryToDecimal) {
    SC_METHOD(convert);
    sensitive << binary_in;
  }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined a module called `BinaryToDecimal` that takes in a binary value as input and produces the decimal equivalent as output. The module has a single method called `convert`, which is the logic for the binary to decimal conversion. The method reads in the binary input, initializes a decimal variable to 0, and a base variable to 1. It then loops through the digits of the binary input using a while loop, extracting the last digit of the input and multiplying it by the current base value to get the decimal equivalent. The method then adds the decimal equivalent of the last digit to the running total and increments the base value by 2. After the loop, the method writes the running total to the output port.

The `SC_METHOD` declaration indicates that this method is a combinational logic, meaning that it will be executed every time the input value changes. We have also made the module sensitive to changes in the input port `binary_in`, which means that the `convert` method will be executed every time the input value changes. This ensures that the output is always up-to-date with the latest input value.
