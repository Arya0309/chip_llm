  **Inputs:**

* `m[][4]`: a 2D matrix of integers with dimensions `r` rows and `c` columns
* `r`: the number of rows in the matrix `m[][4]`
* `c`: the number of columns in the matrix `m[][4]`

**Outputs:**

* The sorted matrix `m[][4]` row-wise in the same `m[][4]` matrix

**Line-by-line explanation of the C++/C code:**

1. The first line, `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`, is a standard line that includes the C++ standard library.
2. The following line, `using namespace std;`, is also a standard line that allows the code to use the standard library functions without the need to specify the `std::` namespace.
3. The `swap` function is defined in the next line. It takes two integer pointers `xp` and `yp` and swaps their values.
4. The `sortRowWise` function is defined next. It takes the matrix `m[][4]`, the number of rows `r`, and the number of columns `c` as input.
5. The function first iterates over the rows of the matrix using a for loop.
6. Inside the for loop, it iterates over the columns of the matrix using a nested for loop.
7. Inside the nested for loop, it compares the values of two adjacent elements in the current row and swaps them if the first element is greater than the second element.
8. The swapping continues until the end of the current row is reached.
9. The function then iterates over the rows of the matrix again to print the sorted matrix.
10. The swapping and printing continues until the end of the matrix is reached.

**SystemC code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SortMatrix) {
    sc_in<bool> clk;
    sc_in<bool> start;
    sc_out<bool> done;

    SC_CTOR(SortMatrix) {
        SC_THREAD(sort);
        sensitive << clk.pos();
        done.write(false);
    }

    void sort() {
        int m[][4] = {{9, 8, 7, 1},
            {7, 3, 0, 2},
            {9, 5, 3, 2},
            {6, 3, 1, 2}};
        int c = sizeof(m[0]) / sizeof(m[0][0]);
        int r = sizeof(m) / sizeof(m[0]);

        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k < c - j - 1; k++) {
                    if (m[i][k] > m[i][k + 1]) {
                        swap(m[i][k], m[i][k + 1]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
            }
            printf("\n");
        }

        done.write(true);
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, the `sort` function is the equivalent of the `sortRowWise` function in the original C++/C code. The `swap` function is also included inside the `sort` function. The `SC_CTOR` macro is used to define the constructor for the `SortMatrix` module, which initializes the `done` signal to `false` and the `CLK` signal to the positive edge of the clock. The `sensitive << clk.pos()` line specifies that the `sort` function should be executed on the positive edge of the clock. The `printf` statements are used to print the sorted matrix to the console. The `done` signal is set to `true` after the matrix is sorted and printed.
