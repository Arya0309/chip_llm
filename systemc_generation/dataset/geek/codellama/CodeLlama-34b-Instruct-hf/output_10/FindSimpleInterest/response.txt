  **Inputs and Outputs:**

* The C++/C code takes three inputs: `P`, `R`, and `T`, which are of type `float`.
* The code also has one output: `SI`, which is of type `float`.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. `// C++ program to find simple interest for given principal amount, time and rate of interest.`: This is a comment that describes the purpose of the program.
2. `#include<iostream>`: This line includes the `iostream` header file, which provides input and output operations.
3. `using namespace std;`: This line tells the compiler to use the `std` namespace, which contains the `cout` and `cin` objects used for input and output.
4. `// Driver code`: This is another comment that marks the beginning of the program's main functionality.
5. `int main() {`: This line begins the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.
6. `float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1;`: These lines declare three variables: `P`, `R`, and `T`, and initialize them to `1`.
7. `// Calculate simple interest`: This is a comment that describes the purpose of the following block of code.
8. `float SI = (P * T * R) / 100;`: This line calculates the simple interest by multiplying `P`, `T`, and `R` and dividing the result by `100`. The result is stored in the `SI` variable.
9. `// Print the resultant value of SI`: This is a comment that describes the purpose of the following line of code.
10. `cout << "Simple Interest = " << SI;`: This line prints the value of `SI` to the console.
11. `return 0;`: This line terminates the `main` function and returns the value `0` to the operating system.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SimpleInterest) {
    sc_in<float> P;  // Input port for principal amount
    sc_in<float> R;  // Input port for rate of interest
    sc_in<float> T;  // Input port for time
    sc_out<float> SI;  // Output port for simple interest

    SC_CTOR(SimpleInterest) {
        // Process to calculate simple interest
        SC_METHOD(calcSI);
        sensitive << P << R << T;
    }

    void calcSI() {
        SI.write((P.read() * T.read() * R.read()) / 100);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we create a module called `SimpleInterest` that has three input ports `P`, `R`, and `T` and one output port `SI`. The `calcSI` method calculates the simple interest by multiplying `P`, `T`, and `R` and dividing the result by `100`. The result is written to the `SI` output port.

The `sensitive` line specifies that the `calcSI` method should be triggered whenever any of the input ports `P`, `R`, or `T` changes. This ensures that the `calcSI` method is executed whenever the input values change.
