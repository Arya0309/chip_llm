  **Inputs:**

* `Dividend`: the integer being divided.
* `Divisor`: the integer by which the division is performed.

**Outputs:**

* `Quotient`: the result of the division.
* `Remainder`: the remainder of the division.
* `Error`: a Boolean flag indicating whether the division was successful or not. If `Divisor` is 0, `Error` is set to `true`.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. `int Dividend, Quotient, Divisor, Remainder;`
Declares four integer variables: `Dividend`, `Quotient`, `Divisor`, and `Remainder`.
2. `cin >> Dividend >> Divisor;`
Reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `Dividend` and `Divisor` respectively.
3. `if (Divisor == 0) {`
Checks if `Divisor` is equal to 0. If it is, the following code is executed.
4. `cout << "Error: Divisor cannot be zero." << endl;`
Prints an error message to the standard output indicating that `Divisor` cannot be zero.
5. `} else {`
If `Divisor` is not equal to 0, the following code is executed.
6. `Quotient = Dividend / Divisor;`
Computes the quotient of `Dividend` divided by `Divisor` and assigns the result to `Quotient`.
7. `Remainder = Dividend % Divisor;`
Computes the remainder of `Dividend` divided by `Divisor` and assigns the result to `Remainder`.
8. `cout << "The Quotient = " << Quotient << endl;`
Prints the value of `Quotient` to the standard output.
9. `cout << "The Remainder = " << Remainder << endl;`
Prints the value of `Remainder` to the standard output.
10. `return 0;`
Returns 0 from `main()`, indicating the successful termination of the program.

**SystemC Code Snippet:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Divider) {
    sc_in<bool> Error;
    sc_in<int> Dividend, Divisor, Quotient, Remainder;

    SC_CTOR(Divider) {
        SC_METHOD(divide);
        sensitive << Dividend << Divisor;
    }

    void divide() {
        if (Divisor == 0) {
            Error.write(true);
        } else {
            Quotient.write(Dividend / Divisor);
            Remainder.write(Dividend % Divisor);
        }
    }
};
```
The above SystemC code defines a `Divider` module that takes in four input signals: `Error`, `Dividend`, `Divisor`, `Quotient`, and `Remainder`. The module also has an `SC_METHOD` called `divide` that is sensitive to changes in `Dividend` and `Divisor`.

The `divide` method checks if `Divisor` is equal to `0`. If it is, it writes `true` to `Error`. Otherwise, it computes the quotient and remainder of `Dividend` divided by `Divisor` and writes the results to `Quotient` and `Remainder`, respectively.

Note that the input signals are named according to the requirements defined in the problem statement, and the SystemC code uses the same approach as the C++/C code to perform the division operation.
