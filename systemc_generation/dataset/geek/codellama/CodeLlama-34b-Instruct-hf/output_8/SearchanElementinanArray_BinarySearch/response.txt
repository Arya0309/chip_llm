  **Inputs:**

* `target`: The element to be searched in the vector `v`.
* `v`: The vector to be searched.

**Outputs:**

* `found`: A boolean value indicating whether the `target` element was found in the vector.

**C++/C Code Summary:**

The provided C++/C code implements an iterative binary search algorithm to search for a given element `target` in a given vector `v`. The algorithm divides the vector into two parts and finds the middle element from the first part. If the middle element is equal to `target`, the algorithm returns `true` to indicate that `target` was found in the vector. If the middle element is greater than `target`, the algorithm recursively searches the left half of the vector. If the middle element is smaller than `target`, the algorithm recursively searches the right half of the vector. If no match is found, the algorithm returns `false` to indicate that `target` was not found in the vector.

**SystemC Code:**
```
// SystemC code for iterative binary search
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinarySearch) {
    sc_in<int> target;  // The element to be searched
    sc_in<sc_vector<int>> v;  // The vector to be searched
    sc_out<bool> found;  // Output port for indicating whether the element was found or not

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinarySearch) {
        // Process to perform binary search
        SC_METHOD(search);
        sensitive << target << v;
    }

    // Method to perform binary search
    void search() {
        int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
            if (v[mid] == target) {
                found.write(true);
                return;
            }
            if (v[mid] > target) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        found.write(false);
    }
};
```
The SystemC code defines a `BinarySearch` module that takes a vector `v` and an element `target` as input and produces a boolean output `found` indicating whether `target` was found in `v`. The code also defines a `search` process that performs the binary search algorithm. The `search` process takes a single input `target` and a single output `found` and recursively divides the vector `v` into two parts until the `target` element is found or all elements have been searched. If the `target` element is found, the boolean output `found` is set to `true`. If the `target` element is not found, the output `found` is set to `false`.
