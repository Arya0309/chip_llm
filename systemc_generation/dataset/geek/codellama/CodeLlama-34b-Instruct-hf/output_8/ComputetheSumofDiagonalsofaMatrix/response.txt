  **Inputs and Outputs:**

* Inputs:
	+ `mat`: A two-dimensional array representing the matrix whose diagonals are to be summed.
	+ `n`: The size of the matrix (assumed to be square).
* Outputs:
	+ `principal`: The sum of the elements in the principal diagonal.
	+ `secondary`: The sum of the elements in the secondary diagonal.

**Code Summary:**

The program defines a function called `printDiagonalSums` that takes a two-dimensional array `mat` and an integer `n` as inputs. The function calculates and prints the sum of the elements in the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix.

Here is a line-by-line breakdown of the function:

1. `int principal = 0, secondary = 0;`: The function declares and initializes two integer variables `principal` and `secondary` to zero.
2. `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { ... }`: The function uses a nested for loop to iterate over the elements in the matrix. The outer loop iterates over the rows of the matrix, and the inner loop iterates over the columns.
	* `for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) { ... }`: The inner loop calculates the sum of the elements in each diagonal.
		+ `if (i == j) { ... }`: If the row and column indices are equal (i.e., we are on the principal diagonal), the element is added to the `principal` sum.
		+ `else if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) { ... }`: If the sum of the row and column indices is equal to the size of the matrix minus one (i.e., we are on the secondary diagonal), the element is added to the `secondary` sum.
		+ `else { ... }`: If the element is not on either diagonal, it is not added to the sum.
3. `cout << "Principal Diagonal:" << principal << endl;`: The function prints the sum of the elements in the principal diagonal.
4. `cout << "Secondary Diagonal:" << secondary << endl;`: The function prints the sum of the elements in the secondary diagonal.

**SystemC Code:**

Here is a SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source and incorporates the signals defined above:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSums) {
    sc_in<sc_int<32>> matrix[32];
    sc_out<sc_int<32>> principal;
    sc_out<sc_int<32>> secondary;

    void calculate() {
        sc_int<32> tmp;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 32; j++) {
                if (i == j) {
                    tmp = matrix[i][j];
                    principal.write(principal.read() + tmp.read());
                } else if ((i + j) == (32 - 1)) {
                    tmp = matrix[i][j];
                    secondary.write(secondary.read() + tmp.read());
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `matrix` signal is a two-dimensional array of 32-bit integers. The `principal` and `secondary` signals are 32-bit integers that represent the sums of the elements in the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively. The `calculate` method is responsible for calculating the sums of the elements in the diagonals and writing them to the `principal` and `secondary` signals. The method loops over the elements in the matrix, calculates the sums of the elements in each diagonal using the same logic as the original C++/C code, and writes the sums to the output signals.
