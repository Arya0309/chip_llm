  **Inputs:**

* `in`: The input number whose factorial needs to be calculated.

**Outputs:**

* `out`: The factorial of the input number.

**Code Summary:**

The code defines a function `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as input and returns its factorial. The function uses a loop to iterate from 2 to `n` and multiplies each number by the previous result, starting from 1.

The `main` function takes in a user input `num` and prints the factorial of `num`.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Factorial)
{
    sc_in<unsigned int> num;   // Input port for the number
    sc_out<unsigned int> fact; // Output port for the factorial

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Factorial)
    {
        SC_METHOD(factorial);
        sensitive << num;
    }

    // Method to calculate the factorial
    void factorial()
    {
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= num.read(); i++)
        {
            res *= i;
        }
        fact.write(res);
    }
};
```
In this code, we define a `Factorial` module that takes in a single input port `num` of type `unsigned int` and an output port `fact` of the same type. The module has a single method `factorial` that calculates the factorial of the input number.

The method `factorial` starts by initializing a variable `res` to 1. It then uses a loop to iterate from 2 to `num` and multiplies each number by the previous result, starting from 1. Finally, it writes the result to the output port `fact`.

The `SC_CTOR` macro is used to define the constructor for the `Factorial` module, which is responsible for creating the module's input and output ports. The `sensitive` keyword is used to specify that the method `factorial` should be triggered whenever the input port `num` is written to.
