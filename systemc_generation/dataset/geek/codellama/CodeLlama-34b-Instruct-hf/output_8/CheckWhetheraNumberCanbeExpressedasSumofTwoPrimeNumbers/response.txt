  **Inputs:**

* `int n`: An integer input specifying the prime number to be checked.

**Outputs:**

* `bool result_out`: A boolean output indicating whether the prime number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

**Code Summary:**

The given C++/C code checks whether a prime number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The code consists of two functions: `isPrime` and `isPossible`.

The `isPrime` function checks whether a given integer is a prime number. It does so by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of the integers in that range. If the number is divisible, it is not prime, and the function returns false. If the number is not divisible by any integer in the range, it is prime, and the function returns true.

The `isPossible` function checks whether a prime number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. It does so by calling the `isPrime` function twice, once for the given prime number and once for the number minus 2. If both calls to `isPrime` return true, the function returns true, indicating that the prime number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. If either call to `isPrime` returns false, the function returns false.

The `main` function takes an integer input from the user and passes it to the `isPossible` function to check if it can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. It then outputs the result, either "Yes" or "No", based on the return value of `isPossible`.

**SystemC Code Snippet:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimeCheck) {
    sc_in<int> n_in;
    sc_out<bool> result_out;

    // Function to check whether a number is prime or not
    bool isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1)
            return false;

        for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
            if (n % i == 0)
                return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

    // Function to check if a prime number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers
    bool isPossible(int n) {
        if (isPrime(n) && isPrime(n - 2))
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    }

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PrimeCheck) {
        SC_THREAD(isPossible);
        sensitive << n_in;
        result_out.write(isPossible(n_in.read()));
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `PrimeCheck` that takes an input signal `n_in` and has an output signal `result_out`. The module has two functions, `isPrime` and `isPossible`, which have the same functionality as their C++/C counterparts. The constructor initializes a thread that calls the `isPossible` function on the input signal `n_in` and writes the result to the output signal `result_out`.

Note that the signals defined in the SystemC code (`n_in` and `result_out`) are the same as the signals defined in the provided testbench, so the SystemC code can be integrated seamlessly with the testbench.
