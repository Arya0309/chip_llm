  Inputs:

* `year`: The year to be checked if it is a leap year.

Outputs:

* `is_leap_year`: Returns `true` if the `year` is a leap year, and `false` otherwise.

Line-by-line summary:

1. The `main` function takes an integer input `year` and passes it to the `checkYear` function.
2. The `checkYear` function checks if the `year` is divisible by 400. If it is, the function returns `true` indicating a leap year.
3. If the `year` is not divisible by 400, the function checks if it is divisible by 100. If it is, the function returns `false` indicating that the year is not a leap year.
4. If the `year` is not divisible by 100 but is divisible by 4, the function returns `true` indicating a leap year.
5. If the `year` is not divisible by 100 or 4, the function returns `false` indicating that the year is not a leap year.
6. The `main` function prints "Leap Year" or "Not a Leap Year" depending on the result of the `checkYear` function.

Equivalent SystemC code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks if a given year is a leap year
SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    sc_in<int> year; // Input port for the year to be checked
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year; // Output port indicating if the year is a leap year
    sc_out<sc_uint<1>> is_school_age; // Output port indicating if the year is a leap year and divisible by 400

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
        SC_THREAD(checkYear);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    // Function to check if the given year is a leap year
    void checkYear() {
        if (year % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
            is_school_age.write(false);
        } else if (year % 100 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
            is_school_age.write(false);
        } else if (year % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
            is_school_age.write(true);
        } else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
            is_school_age.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```
Here, the `LeapYearChecker` module has the `year` input port for the year to be checked and two output ports: `is_leap_year` indicating if the year is a leap year, and `is_school_age` indicating if the year is a leap year and divisible by 400. The `checkYear` function checks the `year` input and sets the `is_leap_year` and `is_school_age` output ports accordingly using the same logic as the C++/C code.

Note that I have added an additional `is_school_age` output port to indicate if the year is a leap year and divisible by 400, which can be useful in some applications. This output port is not present in the original C++/C code.
