  **Inputs and Outputs:**

* Inputs:
	+ mat1: A 2D array of integers of size [2][2].
	+ mat2: A 2D array of integers of size [2][3].
* Outputs:
	+ rslt: A 2D array of integers of size [2][3] containing the result of the matrix multiplication.

**Lines 1-11: Header and Namespace Imports**

* `bits/stdc++.h` includes the C++ standard library, which provides access to various data types, functions, and libraries.
* `std::` is the namespace for the C++ standard library.

**Lines 13-24: Function Declaration and Implementation**

* The `mulMat` function declaration takes two 2D arrays of integers as input and multiplies them using the matrix multiplication formula.
* `int rslt[R1][C2]` declares a 2D array of integers `rslt` of size [2][3] to store the result of the multiplication.
* The first for loop iterates over the rows of `mat1`, and the second for loop iterates over the columns of `mat2`.
* The third for loop calculates the element-wise product of each row and column, which is used to compute the resulting matrix.
* The resulting matrix is then printed to the console.

**Lines 26-31: Function Call**

* The function `mulMat` is called with the input matrices `mat1` and `mat2`.

**Lines 32-41: Main**

* `R1`, `C1`, `R2`, and `C2` are defined as the matrix dimensions.
* `mat1` and `mat2` are declared as 2D arrays of integers of size [2][2] and [2][3], respectively.
* The `if` statement checks if the number of columns in `mat1` is equal to the number of rows in `mat2`. If it is not, an error message is printed and the program exits.
* The `mulMat` function is called with `mat1` and `mat2` as inputs.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixMultiplier) {
    sc_in<int> A[SIZE_A]; // Input matrix A
    sc_in<int> B[SIZE_B]; // Input matrix B
    sc_out<int> C[SIZE_RESULT]; // Output matrix C

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatrixMultiplier) {
        // Process to perform matrix multiplication
        SC_METHOD(mulMat);
        sensitive << A << B;
    }

    // Method to perform matrix multiplication
    void mulMat() {
        int rslt[R1][C2]; // Temporary matrix to store result
        for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                rslt[i][j] = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < R2; k++) {
                    rslt[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
                }
            }
        }
        // Copy temporary matrix to output matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                C[i][j].write(rslt[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `MatrixMultiplier` that takes two input matrices `A` and `B` and one output matrix `C`. The module has a constructor that declares a process `mulMat` that performs the matrix multiplication. The `mulMat` process multiplies the two input matrices element-wise and stores the result in a temporary matrix `rslt`. Afterwards, the temporary matrix is copied to the output matrix `C`.

Note that the `sc_in<int> A[SIZE_A];` and `sc_in<int> B[SIZE_B];` lines are creating input signals for the module, and `sc_out<int> C[SIZE_RESULT];` is creating an output signal. These signals are used to interface with the rest of the testbench.
