  **Inputs:**

* `n`: An integer representing the number to be checked for primality.

**Outputs:**

* `is_prime`: A boolean output indicating whether the input number is prime or not.

**Summary:**
The given C++ code is a simple program that uses trial division to check if a given integer is prime or not. The program starts by declaring two variables: `n` and `cnt`. `n` is the input number to be checked for primality, while `cnt` is used to count the number of divisors of `n`.

The program then checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, then it is not prime and the program prints a message to that effect. Otherwise, the program enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by each number in the range. For each divisor found, `cnt` is incremented.

After the loop, the program checks if `cnt` is greater than 2. If it is, then `n` is not prime and the program prints a message to that effect. Otherwise, if `cnt` is equal to 2 (which means that `n` is only divisible by 1 and itself), then `n` is prime and the program prints a message to that effect.

Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful termination.

**SystemC Code:**
The following SystemC code snippet captures the same logic as the given C++ code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimalityChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n; // Input port for the number to be checked for primality
    sc_out<bool> is_prime; // Output port for the primality result

    SC_CTOR(PrimalityChecker) {
        SC_METHOD(check_primality);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    void check_primality() {
        int cnt = 0;

        if (n.read() <= 1) {
            is_prime.write(false);
        } else {
            for (int i = 1; i <= n.read(); i++) {
                if (n.read() % i == 0) {
                    cnt++;
                }
            }

            if (cnt > 2) {
                is_prime.write(false);
            } else {
                is_prime.write(true);
            }
        }
    }
};
```
Note that the SystemC code provides the same inputs and outputs as the original C++ code, with the added benefit of using ports to enable its integration into a high-level synthesis flow. The `check_primality` method implements the same logic as the original C++ code, using the `n` input and the `is_prime` output to determine the primality of the input number.
