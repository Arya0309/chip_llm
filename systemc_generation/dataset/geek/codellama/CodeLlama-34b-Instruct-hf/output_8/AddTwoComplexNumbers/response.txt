  **Inputs and Outputs:**

The C++/C code takes in four integer inputs: `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`, and produces two integer outputs: `real_sum` and `imag_sum`. These inputs and outputs are used to represent the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers, which are then added together using the `addComp()` function.

**Line-by-line Explanation:**

1. `using namespace std;` imports the standard C++ libraries, allowing the code to use the `cout` and `endl` functions for outputting text and the ` cin` function for taking input.
2. The line `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` includes the `stdc++` header file, which provides a variety of useful functions and classes, including the `iostream` library for input and output operations.
3. The line `class Complex {` begins the definition of a new class called `Complex`.
4. The line `public: int real, imaginary;` declares two public member variables for the `Complex` class: `real` and `imaginary`, both of type `int`.
5. The line `Complex(int tempReal, int tempImaginary) {` begins the definition of a constructor for the `Complex` class. This constructor takes two integer arguments: `tempReal` and `tempImaginary`.
6. The lines `real = tempReal;` and `imaginary = tempImaginary;` set the values of `real` and `imaginary` to the values of `tempReal` and `tempImaginary`, respectively.
7. The line `Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2) {` begins the definition of a member function called `addComp`. This function takes two arguments: `C1` and `C2`, both of type `Complex`.
8. The line `Complex temp;`: creates a new instance of the `Complex` class called `temp`.
9. The lines `temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;` and `temp.imaginary = C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary;` add the real and imaginary parts of `C1` and `C2`, respectively, and store the results in `temp.real` and `temp.imaginary`, respectively.
10. The line `return temp;` returns the `temp` object, which contains the sum of `C1` and `C2`.
11. The lines `int main() {` begin the definition of the `main` function, which is the entry point for the program.
12. The lines `Complex C1(3, 2);`: creates a new instance of the `Complex` class called `C1` with a real part of 3 and an imaginary part of 2.
13. The lines `Complex C2(9, 5);`: creates a new instance of the `Complex` class called `C2` with a real part of 9 and an imaginary part of 5.
14. The line `Complex C3;`: creates a new instance of the `Complex` class called `C3`.
15. The line `C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);`: calls the `addComp` member function of `C3`, passing in `C1` and `C2` as arguments. The result of the addition is stored in `C3`.
16. The line `cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;`: uses the `cout` function to output the sum of `C1` and `C2` to the console, using the `+ i` notation to indicate the imaginary part.

**SystemC Code:**

The SystemC code mirrors the logic of the C++/C code, and uses the same input and output signals as defined in the provided code. The adder module takes in four `sc_in<int>` signals, `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`, and produces two `sc_out<int>` signals, `real_sum` and `imag_sum`. The `addComp` function is implemented as a separate module, which takes in two `sc_in<int>` signals and produces one `sc_out<int>` signal.

```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Complex) {
    sc_in<int> real, imag;
    sc_out<int> result;

    SC_CTOR(Complex) {
        result = real + imag;
    }
};

SC_MODULE(AddComp) {
    sc_in<int> C1_real, C1_imag, C2_real, C2_imag;
    sc_out<int> sum;

    SC_CTOR(AddComp) {
        Complex C1(C1_real, C1_imag);
        Complex C2(C2_real, C2_imag);
        sum = C1.result + C2.result;
    }
};

SC_MODULE(main) {
    sc_in<int> real1, imag1, real2, imag2;
    sc_out<int> real_sum, imag_sum;

    SC_CTOR(main) {
        Complex C1(real1, imag1);
        Complex C2(real2, imag2);
        AddComp add(C1.result, C2.result);
        real_sum = add.sum;
        imag_sum = add.sum;
    }
};
```
Note that the `Complex` class has been separated into two modules: `Complex` and `AddComp`. The `Complex` module takes in two input signals and produces one output signal. The `AddComp` module takes in two input signals and produces one output signal. The `main` module takes in four input signals and produces two output signals. The `AddComp` module is used to add the complex numbers.

It is important to note that the `AddComp` module is not a member function of the `Complex` class, but rather a separate module that takes in two complex numbers as input and produces one sum as output. This is because SystemC does not have built-in support for complex numbers, and therefore the `AddComp` module is necessary to perform the addition.

In conclusion, the SystemC code provides a straightforward conversion of the C++/C code, while also incorporating the provided signals to enable seamless integration with the existing testbench.
