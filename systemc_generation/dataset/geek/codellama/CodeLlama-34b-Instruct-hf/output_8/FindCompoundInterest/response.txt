  Inputs:

* `principal`: the initial amount of money in the investment
* `rate`: the annual interest rate as a percentage
* `time`: the time in years

Outputs:

* `ci`: the compound interest

Explanation:

The program calculates compound interest using the formula: $A = P \times (1 + r/100)^t$, where $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the annual interest rate, $t$ is the time in years, and $A$ is the compound interest.

First, the principal, rate, and time are declared as double-precision floating-point numbers.

The program then calculates the compound interest using the formula and stores it in the variable `A`.

Finally, the program outputs the compound interest using the `cout` statement.

Equivalent SystemC code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CompoundInterest) {
    // Input ports
    sc_in<double> principal;
    sc_in<double> rate;
    sc_in<double> time;

    // Output port
    sc_out<double> ci;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterest) {
        // Method to calculate compound interest
        SC_METHOD(calc_compound_interest);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calc_compound_interest() {
        double A = principal * (pow(1 + rate / 100, time));
        ci.write(A - principal);
    }
};
```
Note that the SystemC code uses the same variables and calculations as the original C++/C code, with the differences being the use of `sc_in`, `sc_out`, and `SC_CTOR` macros to define the input and output ports and the constructor method, and the use of `sc_write` to write the output value to the output port.
