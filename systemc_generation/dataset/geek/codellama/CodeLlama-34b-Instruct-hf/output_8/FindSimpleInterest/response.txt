  **Inputs**:

* `P`: The principal amount of the investment.
* `R`: The rate of interest as a decimal value (e.g., 0.05 for 5% interest).
* `T`: The time period of the investment in years.

**Outputs**:

* `SI`: The simple interest calculated based on the input values.

**Major Lines and Blocks of Code**:

1. `float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1;`: These lines declare and initialize the input variables. `P`, `R`, and `T` are assigned the values 1, 1, and 1, respectively, which are used as default values if no input values are provided.
2. `// Calculate simple interest': This line is a comment that explains the purpose of the following code.
3. `float SI = (P * T * R) / 100;`: This line calculates the simple interest using the formula: SI = (P \* T \* R) / 100, where P is the principal amount, T is the time period, and R is the rate of interest. The result is stored in the `SI` variable.
4. `// Print the resultant value of SI': This line is another comment that explains the purpose of the following `cout` statement.
5. `cout << "Simple Interest = " << SI;`: This line prints the value of `SI` to the console, using the `cout` statement. The text "Simple Interest = " is used as a label to indicate the value being printed.

**SystemC Code**:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to calculate simple interest
SC_MODULE(SimpleInterest) {
    sc_in<float> P;          // Principal amount
    sc_in<float> R;          // Rate of interest
    sc_in<int> T;            // Time period
    sc_out<float> SI;        // Simple interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SimpleInterest) {
        P.bind(P);
        R.bind(R);
        T.bind(T);
        SI.bind(SI);
    }

    // Method to calculate simple interest
    void cal() {
        float SI = (P * T * R) / 100;
    }

    // Print the resultant value of SI
    void print() {
        std::cout << "Simple Interest = " << SI << std::endl;
    }
};
```
Note that in the SystemC code, we have used the `sc_in` and `sc_out` port classes to represent the input and output ports of the module, respectively. The `sc_in` and `sc_out` port classes are used to bind the input and output ports to the signals defined in the testbench.

In the constructor of the `SimpleInterest` module, we bind the input ports to the signals passed to the module. We also bind the output port to the `SI` signal.

In the `cal()` method, we calculate the simple interest using the formula: SI = (P \* T \* R) / 100, where P, T, and R are the values of the input signals. The result is stored in the `SI` variable.

In the `print()` method, we print the value of `SI` to the console using the `std::cout` statement. The text "Simple Interest = " is used as a label to indicate the value being printed.
