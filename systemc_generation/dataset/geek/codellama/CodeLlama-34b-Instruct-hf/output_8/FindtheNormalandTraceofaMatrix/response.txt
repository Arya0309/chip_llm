  **Inputs:**

* `matrix`: A 2D array of integers representing a square matrix of size `SIZE`.
* `trace`: A variable that stores the trace of the matrix.
* `norm`: A variable that stores the normal of the matrix.

**Outputs:**

* `trace`: The trace of the matrix.
* `norm`: The normal of the matrix.

**Explanation:**

The provided code is a C++ program that takes a square matrix of integers as input and calculates its trace and normal.

The `findTrace` function takes the matrix and its size `n` as arguments, and calculates the trace of the matrix by summing the diagonals. It returns the sum.

The `findNormal` function takes the matrix and its size `n` as arguments, and calculates the normal of the matrix by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of all the elements. It returns the square root value.

In the `main` function, a 5x5 matrix is created with all elements set to 1. The `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions are called with the matrix and its size as arguments. The results are stored in the `trace` and `norm` variables, respectively.

**SystemC code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Matrix) {
  sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE][SIZE];
  sc_out<int> trace;
  sc_out<int> norm;

  SC_CTOR(Matrix) {
    // Process to perform addition
    SC_METHOD(findTrace);
    sensitive << matrix;
  }

  // Method to calculate trace
  void findTrace() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
        sum += matrix[i][j].read();
      }
    }
    trace.write(sum);
  }

  // Method to calculate normal
  void findNormal() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
        sum += matrix[i][j].read() * matrix[i][j].read();
      }
    }
    norm.write(sqrt(sum));
  }
};
```
In the SystemC code, `matrix` is an input array of integers that represents the square matrix of size `SIZE`. `trace` and `norm` are output ports that store the trace and normal of the matrix, respectively.

The `findTrace` and `findNormal` methods are called in the constructor, which is sensitive to the `matrix` array. The `findTrace` method calculates the trace of the matrix by summing the diagonals, and the `findNormal` method calculates the normal of the matrix by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of all the elements. The results are written to the `trace` and `norm` variables, respectively.
