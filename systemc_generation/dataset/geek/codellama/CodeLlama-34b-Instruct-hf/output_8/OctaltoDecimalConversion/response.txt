  **Explanation:**

The provided C++/C code is a simple program that takes an octal number as input and converts it to a decimal number. The input is taken in the form of an integer, and the output is also an integer representing the decimal number.

The code first defines a function named `octalToDecimal` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns its decimal equivalent. The function works by iterating over each digit of the octal number, multiplying it by the appropriate base value (8^0, 8^1, 8^2, etc.), and adding up the results.

The function `octalToDecimal` is then called with the input integer in the `main` function, and the output is printed to the console.

**SystemC Code:**

The following is a SystemC equivalent of the provided C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(OctalToDecimal) {
    sc_in<int> octal_input;
    sc_out<int> decimal_output;

    // Function to convert octal to decimal
    void octalToDecimal(int n) {
        int dec_value = 0;
        int base = 1;
        int temp = n;
        while (temp) {
            int last_digit = temp % 10;
            temp = temp / 10;
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base = base * 8;
        }
        decimal_output.write(dec_value);
    }

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(OctalToDecimal) {
        // Process to convert octal to decimal
        SC_METHOD(octalToDecimal);
        sensitive << octal_input;
    }

    // Method to convert octal to decimal
    void octalToDecimal() {
        octalToDecimal(octal_input.read());
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined a `OctalToDecimal` module that takes an octal input and produces a decimal output. The module consists of an input port named `octal_input` and an output port named `decimal_output`.

The `octalToDecimal` function is called by the `sensitive` process in the constructor, which is triggered whenever the input `octal_input` changes. The function works as described in the original C++/C code, converting the octal input to decimal using the formula mentioned earlier. The result is then written to the output port `decimal_output`.

In summary, the provided SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source, while adding the necessary inputs and outputs to work with our existing testbench.
