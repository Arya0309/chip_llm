  **Inputs**:

* `n`: The number of Fibonacci numbers to sum.

**Outputs**:

* `sum`: The sum of the even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to `n` terms.

**Summary**:

The provided C++/C code defines a function `calculateEvenSum` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to `n` terms. The function first initializes the first two Fibonacci numbers, `fibo[0]` and `fibo[1]`, to 0 and 1, respectively. It then computes the remaining Fibonacci numbers by adding the previous two terms and stores them in the `fibo` array. If the current index is even, the function adds the current value to the `sum`. Finally, the function returns the sum.

The driver code prompts the user to enter a value for `n` and then calls the `calculateEvenSum` function with `n` as an argument. The result is printed to the console.

**SystemC Code**:
```c
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that computes the sum of even-indexed Fibonacci numbers
SC_MODULE(FibonacciSum) {
    sc_in<int> n;  // Input port for the number of terms
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(FibonacciSum) {
        // Process to compute the sum
        SC_METHOD(computeSum);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to compute the sum
    void computeSum() {
        int fibo[n.read() * 2 + 1];
        fibo[0] = 0;
        fibo[1] = 1;

        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n.read() * 2; i++) {
            fibo[i] = fibo[i - 1] + fibo[i - 2];
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                sum += fibo[i];
            }
        }

        sum.write(sum);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `FibonacciSum` module has two ports: `n`, which is an input port that receives the number of terms, and `sum`, which is an output port that returns the sum of the even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to `n` terms. The `computeSum` method computes the sum by first initializing the first two Fibonacci numbers and then computing the remaining Fibonacci numbers using the recurrence relation. If the current index is even, the method adds the current value to the sum. Finally, the `sum` variable is written to the `sum` port.
