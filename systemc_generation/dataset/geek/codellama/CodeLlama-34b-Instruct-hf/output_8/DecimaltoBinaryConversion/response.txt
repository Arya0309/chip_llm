  **Inputs:**

* `dec_in`: An integer input representing the decimal number to be converted to binary.

**Outputs:**

* `binary_out`: An integer output representing the binary equivalent of the input decimal number.

**C++/C Code Analysis:**

The provided C++/C code defines a function `decToBinary` that takes an integer input `n` and converts it to a binary number. The function first declares an array `binaryNum` of size 32 to store the binary representation of the input number. The function then initializes a counter variable `i` to 0 and enters a while loop that runs until the input number is greater than 0.

Inside the while loop, the function calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 2 and stores it in the `binaryNum` array at index `i`. The function then divides `n` by 2 and increments the counter variable `i`. This process continues until the input number is 0, at which point the function exits the while loop.

After the while loop, the function prints the binary representation of the input number in reverse order using a for loop that runs from `i-1` to 0. The binary representation is printed to the console using the `cout` statement.

Finally, the function returns 0, indicating successful execution.

**SystemC Equivalent:**

The SystemC code snippet below is an equivalent implementation of the provided C++/C code. It defines a module `DecToBinary` that takes an integer input `dec_in` and produces an integer output `binary_out`. The module utilizes the same logic as the C++/C code, but operates on SystemC signals instead of C++ standard library data types.

```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that converts a decimal number to binary
SC_MODULE(DecToBinary) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for the binary representation

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DecToBinary) {
        // Process to perform the conversion
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    // Method to convert the decimal number to binary
    void convert() {
        int i = 0;
        int binaryNum[32];
        int n = dec_in.read();
        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
            binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
    }
};
```

In the constructor of the `DecToBinary` module, we initialize the process `convert` to run when the input signal `dec_in` changes. The `convert` method performs the actual conversion from decimal to binary using the same logic as the C++/C code.

Note that the SystemC code uses the signals `dec_in` and `binary_out` to interact with the external world, as specified in the problem statement. These signals are used to input the decimal number to be converted and output the binary representation of that number, respectively.
