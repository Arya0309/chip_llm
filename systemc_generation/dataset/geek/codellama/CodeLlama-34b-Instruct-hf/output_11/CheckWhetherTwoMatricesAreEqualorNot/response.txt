  **Inputs:**

* `A`: A 2D integer array of size `N x N`
* `B`: A 2D integer array of size `N x N`

**Outputs:**

* `identical`: A boolean value indicating whether the two matrices `A` and `B` are identical (i.e., have the same values at the same positions).

**Summary of C++/C Code:**

The code defines a function `areSame(A, B)` that takes two 2D integer arrays `A` and `B` as input. The function returns 1 if the two matrices are identical, and 0 otherwise.

The main function first defines two integer arrays `A` and `B` of size `N x N` and initializes them with some values. Then, it calls the `areSame(A, B)` function to check if the two matrices are identical. If they are identical, the main function prints "Matrices are identical" to the console; otherwise, it prints "Matrices are not identical".

**SystemC Code:**

Here is an equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic of the C++/C code and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:
```c++
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixCompare) {
    sc_in<int> A[SIZE][SIZE];
    sc_in<int> B[SIZE][SIZE];
    sc_out<bool> identical;

    SC_CTOR(MatrixCompare) {
        // Process to compare the two matrices
        SC_METHOD(compare);
        sensitive << A << B;
    }

    void compare() {
        int i, j;
        for (i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                if (A[i][j] != B[i][j]) {
                    identical.write(false);
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
        identical.write(true);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `MatrixCompare` that has three ports:

* `A`: A 2D integer array input port of size `SIZE x SIZE`
* `B`: A 2D integer array input port of size `SIZE x SIZE`
* `identical`: A boolean output port indicating whether the two matrices are identical

In the constructor of the `MatrixCompare` module, we define a process to compare the two matrices `A` and `B`. The process is sensitive to both `A` and `B` inputs and compares them element-wise. If any element is different, the process writes `false` to the `identical` output port and returns. If all elements are the same, the process writes `true` to the `identical` output port.

In the `compare()` method, we first declare two integers `i` and `j` to use as indices for the loops. Then, we loop over the elements of the two matrices `A` and `B` using nested loops, comparing each element using the `if` statement. If any element is different, we write `false` to the `identical` output port and return. If we reach the end of both loops without finding any differences, we write `true` to the `identical` output port.
