  **Inputs**:

1. `a`: The first number to be swapped.
2. `b`: The second number to be swapped.

**Outputs**:

1. `out_a`: The value of `a` after the swap.
2. `out_b`: The value of `b` after the swap.

**Summary**:

The provided C++/C code implements a simple swapping mechanism by using a temporary variable to store the value of `a`, then assigning the value of `b` to `a`, and finally assigning the temporary variable to `b`. The swapped values are printed to the console.

The SystemC code equivalent to the provided C++/C code is shown below:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that swaps two integers
SC_MODULE(Swapper) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> out_a;  // Output port for the swapped first number
    sc_out<int> out_b;  // Output port for the swapped second number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Swapper) {
        // Process to perform swapping
        SC_METHOD(swap);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to perform swapping
    void swap() {
        int temp;  // Temporary variable to store the value of a
        temp = a.read();  // Read the value of a
        a.write(b.read());  // Write the value of b to a
        b.write(temp);  // Write the previous value of a to b
        // Print the swapped values to the console
        cout << "After swapping, a = " << a.read() << ", b = " << b.read() << endl;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `Swapper` that has four ports: `a`, `b`, `out_a`, and `out_b`. The first two ports are the inputs for the two numbers to be swapped, while the last two ports are the outputs for the swapped values.

The constructor for the `Swapper` module initializes the processes for swapping. The `swap` method is defined to perform the actual swap, which involves reading the value of `a`, writing the value of `b` to `a`, and writing the previous value of `a` to `b`. Finally, the swapped values are printed to the console.

Note that we have included the signals defined in the provided testbench code (`sc_in<int> a`, `sc_in<int> b`, `sc_out<int> out_a`, and `sc_out<int> out_b`) in the SystemC code to ensure compatibility with the testbench.
