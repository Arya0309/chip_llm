  **Inputs and Outputs:**
The provided C++/C code accepts an integer input `n` and outputs the sum of all even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to `n` terms.

**Major Line/Block Summary:**
The code defines a function `calculateEvenSum` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to `n` terms. The function consists of the following major lines and blocks:

1. `if (n <= 0) return 0;`: This is the base case for the recursion, which returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 0.
2. `fibo[0] = 0; fibo[1] = 1;`: These are the initial values of the first and second Fibonacci numbers.
3. `int sum = 0;`: This initializes the sum variable to 0.
4. `for (int i = 2; i <= 2 * n; i++)`: This loop iterates from 2 to 2*`n`, generating the remaining Fibonacci numbers and adding them to the sum variable if their indices are even.
5. `if (i % 2 == 0)`: This conditional statement checks if the current index `i` is even. If it is even, the code adds the current Fibonacci number to the sum variable.
6. `return sum;`: This statement returns the sum of all even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to `n` terms.

**SystemC Equivalent:**
The provided SystemC code defines a module called `Fibonacci` that takes an integer input `n` and outputs the sum of all even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to `n` terms. The module consists of the following elements:

1. `sc_in<int> n`: Input port for the integer `n`.
2. `sc_out<int> sum`: Output port for the sum of all even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to `n` terms.
3. `SC_METHOD(calculateEvenSum)`: Method for calculating the sum of all even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to `n` terms.
4. `sensitive << n`: This statement sets the sensitivity of the method to the input `n`.

The method `calculateEvenSum` consists of the following elements:

1. `if (n <= 0) return 0;`: This is the base case for the recursion, which returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 0.
2. `Fibonacci fibo[2 * n + 1];`: This statement declares an array of size 2*`n` + 1 to store the Fibonacci numbers.
3. `fibo[0] = 0; fibo[1] = 1;`: These are the initial values of the first and second Fibonacci numbers.
4. `int sum = 0;`: This initializes the sum variable to 0.
5. `for (int i = 2; i <= 2 * n; i++)`: This loop iterates from 2 to 2*`n`, generating the remaining Fibonacci numbers and adding them to the sum variable if their indices are even.
6. `if (i % 2 == 0)`: This conditional statement checks if the current index `i` is even. If it is even, the code adds the current Fibonacci number to the sum variable.
7. `return sum;`: This statement returns the sum of all even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to `n` terms.

**Compilable Snippet:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Fibonacci) {
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<int> sum;

    SC_CTOR(Fibonacci) {
        SC_METHOD(calculateEvenSum);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    void calculateEvenSum() {
        if (n <= 0) return 0;
        Fibonacci fibo[2 * n + 1];
        fibo[0] = 0; fibo[1] = 1;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= 2 * n; i++) {
            fibo[i] = fibo[i - 1] + fibo[i - 2];
            if (i % 2 == 0)
                sum += fibo[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
