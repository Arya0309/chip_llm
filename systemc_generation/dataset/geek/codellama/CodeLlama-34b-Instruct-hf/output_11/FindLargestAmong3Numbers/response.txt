  **Task 1:**

The program takes three integer inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`, and outputs the largest of these numbers.

**Task 2:**

The inputs of the program are `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are declared as `int` variables. The output is the largest of these three numbers, which is not explicitly declared as a variable but is printed to the console using `cout`.

**Task 3:**

The program first declares three variables, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are initialized to the values of 1, 2, and 11, respectively. It then uses an if-else ladder to compare the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and to print the largest of the three numbers to the console.

The program first checks whether `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program then checks whether `a` is greater than or equal to `c`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `c`, the program prints `a` to the console. Otherwise, it prints `c` to the console.

If `a` is not greater than or equal to `b`, the program then checks whether `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, the program prints `b` to the console. Otherwise, it prints `c` to the console.

**Task 4:**

The following SystemC code snippet captures the logic of the original C++/C program:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that finds the largest among three numbers using if-else-if ladder
SC_MODULE(Ladder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_in<int> c;  // Input port for the third number
    sc_out<int> largest;  // Output port for the largest number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Ladder) {
        // Process to perform comparison and output
        SC_METHOD(compare);
        sensitive << a << b << c;
        largest.write(largest.read());
    }

    // Method to compare the three numbers and output the largest
    void compare() {
        if (a >= b) {
            if (a >= c) {
                largest.write(a);
            } else {
                largest.write(c);
            }
        } else {
            if (b >= c) {
                largest.write(b);
            } else {
                largest.write(c);
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In this code, the module `Ladder` takes three input signals `a`, `b`, and `c`, and an output signal `largest`. The process `compare` compares the three input signals using an if-else ladder, and writes the largest value to the output signal `largest`.

The process `compare` is sensitive to changes in the input signals `a`, `b`, and `c`, and is triggered whenever any of these signals change. When triggered, the process performs the comparison and updates the output signal `largest` accordingly.

Note that the SystemC code uses the same variable names as the original C++/C code, and captures the same logic, but the code is written in a way that is intuitive and easy to read for a SystemC programmer.
