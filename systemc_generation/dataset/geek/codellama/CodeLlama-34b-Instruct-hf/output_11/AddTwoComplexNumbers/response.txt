  Inputs:

* `real1`: The real part of the first complex number.
* `imag1`: The imaginary part of the first complex number.
* `real2`: The real part of the second complex number.
* `imag2`: The imaginary part of the second complex number.

Outputs:

* `real_sum`: The real part of the sum of the two complex numbers.
* `imag_sum`: The imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers.

The provided C++/C code is a simple program to add two complex numbers. It implements a user-defined Complex class, which has two public members: `real` and `imaginary`. The class also has a constructor that initializes the `real` and `imaginary` members, and a method `addComp()` that takes two Complex objects as input and returns their sum.

The `main()` function creates two Complex objects `C1` and `C2`, and calls the `addComp()` method to add them. The sum is then printed to the console.

Here's the SystemC code that faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Complex)
{
    sc_in<int> real;
    sc_in<int> imaginary;
    sc_in<int> op;
    sc_out<int> result;

    SC_CTOR(Complex)
    {
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real << imaginary << op;
    }

    void add()
    {
        result.write(real.read() + imaginary.read() * op.read());
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    sc_signal<int> real1, imag1, real2, imag2;
    sc_signal<int> real_sum, imag_sum;

    Complex C1("C1", real1, imag1, nullptr, real_sum), C2("C2", real2, imag2, nullptr, imag_sum);

    C1.add();
    C2.add();

    sc_end_dt_responses();

    return 0;
}
```
In the above SystemC code, we have defined a Complex module that has four input ports: `real`, `imaginary`, `op`, and `result`. The `real` and `imaginary` ports take in the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The `op` port takes in a 0 or 1, which determines whether the Complex module is in add or subtract mode. The `result` port is an output port that returns the sum or difference of the two complex numbers, depending on the value of `op`.

We have also defined a `main()` function that creates two Complex objects `C1` and `C2`, and connects their input ports to the `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2` signals, respectively. The `real_sum` and `imag_sum` signals are connected to the `result` ports of the two Complex objects, respectively.

We can see that the SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source code. The `add()` method in the Complex module performs the addition or subtraction of the two complex numbers, depending on the value of `op`. The `main()` function calls the `add()` method of the two Complex objects to perform the addition, and the results are stored in the `real_sum` and `imag_sum` signals.
