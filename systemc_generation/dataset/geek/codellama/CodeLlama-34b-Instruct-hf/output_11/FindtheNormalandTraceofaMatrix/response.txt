  **Inputs:**

* A matrix `mat` of size `n x n`
* A constant `MAX` defining the maximum size of the matrix

**Outputs:**

* `trace`, the trace of the matrix `mat`
* `norm`, the normal of the matrix `mat`

**Summary:**

The given C++/C code computes the trace and normal of a given matrix. The trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements, while the normal of a matrix is the square root of the sum of the squares of its elements.

The code first defines two functions, `findTrace` and `findNormal`, which compute the trace and normal of a matrix, respectively. The `findTrace` function iterates over the diagonal elements of the matrix and sums them up to obtain the trace. The `findNormal` function iterates over all elements of the matrix, squares them, and then sums them up to obtain the normal.

The `main` function is the driver code that calls the `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions on a given matrix `mat` and prints the results.

**SystemC Code:**
```sc_module(Matrix) {
  sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];
  sc_out<int> trace;
  sc_out<int> norm;

  void trace() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
        if (i == j) {
          sum += matrix[i][j];
        }
      }
    }
    trace.write(sum);
  }

  void norm() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
        sum += matrix[i][j] * matrix[i][j];
      }
    }
    norm.write(sqrt(sum));
  }
} SC_CTOR();
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined a `Matrix` module that takes a matrix `matrix` as input and outputs the `trace` and `norm` of the matrix. The `trace` function computes the trace of the matrix by iterating over its diagonal elements and summing them up. The `norm` function computes the normal of the matrix by iterating over all elements of the matrix, squaring them, and then summing them up to obtain the square root.

The `SC_CTOR` macro is used to initialize the ports and the function that computes the trace and normal. The `SP_METHOD` macro is used to specify the function that computes the trace and normal. The `sensitive` keyword is used to specify that the functions are sensitive to changes in the input matrix `matrix`.
