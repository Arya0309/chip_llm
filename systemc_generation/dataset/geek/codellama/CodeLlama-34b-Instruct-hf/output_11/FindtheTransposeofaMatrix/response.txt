* The size of the matrix, N

**Outputs:**

* An NxN matrix, B, of integers that is the transpose of matrix A

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This line includes all the standard libraries necessary for the program.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line specifies that the standard namespace should be used.
3. `#define N 4`: This line defines a macro, N, that represents the size of the matrix.
4. `int A[N][N] = {{1, 1, 1, 1}, {2, 2, 2, 2}, {3, 3, 3, 3}, {4, 4, 4, 4}};`: This line declares an NxN matrix, A, and initializes it with the values provided.
5. `int B[N][N], i, j;`: This line declares NxN matrix, B, and two integer variables, i and j, for use in the program.
6. `void transpose(int A[][N], int B[][N])`: This line declares a function, transpose, that takes two NxN matrices as input and returns void.
7. `int i, j;`: This line declares two integer variables, i and j, for use in the transpose function.
8. `for (i = 0; i < N; i++)`: This line starts a loop that iterates N times, with the variable i taking on the values 0, 1, ..., N-1.
9. `for (j = 0; j < N; j++)`: This line starts a nested loop that iterates N times, with the variable j taking on the values 0, 1, ..., N-1.
10. `B[i][j] = A[j][i];`: This line swaps the elements of the two matrices, A and B, at positions (i, j) and (j, i).
11. `}`: This line ends the nested loop.
12. `}`: This line ends the function.
13. `int main()`: This line declares the main function of the program.
14. `transpose(A, B);`: This line calls the transpose function with the matrices A and B as input.
15. `cout << "Result matrix is \n";`: This line outputs the string "Result matrix is " to the terminal.
16. `for (i = 0; i < N; i++)`: This line starts a loop that iterates N times, with the variable i taking on the values 0, 1, ..., N-1.
17. `for (j = 0; j < N; j++)`: This line starts a nested loop that iterates N times, with the variable j taking on the values 0, 1, ..., N-1.
18. `cout << B[i][j] << " ";`: This line outputs the element of matrix B at position (i, j) to the terminal, followed by a space.
19. `}`: This line ends the nested loop.
20. `cout << "\n";`: This line outputs a newline character to the terminal.
21. `return 0;`: This line returns an exit code of 0 to indicate successful execution.
22. `}`: This line ends the main function.

**SystemC Code:**

#include <systemc.h>

// Matrix Transpose Module
SC_MODULE(MatrixTranspose) {
  
    // Input/Output Ports
    sc_in<int> A[N][N];
    sc_out<int> B[N][N];
  
    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatrixTranspose) {
        // Process to tranpose the matrix
        SC_METHOD(transpose);
        sensitive << *A << ;
    }

    // Transpose Method
    void transpose() {
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                B[i][j] = A[j][i];
            }
        }
    }
};
```
This SystemC code declares a module, MatrixTranspose, that takes a 2D array of integers as input and returns its transpose. The module contains an input port for the matrix, A, and an output port for the transposed matrix, B. The module also contains a constructor that declares a process to transpose the matrix. The transpose process is implemented using a nested loop that iterates over the elements of the input matrix and assigns the transposed elements to the corresponding locations in the output matrix. The process is sensitive to the input matrix and runs whenever the input matrix changes.
