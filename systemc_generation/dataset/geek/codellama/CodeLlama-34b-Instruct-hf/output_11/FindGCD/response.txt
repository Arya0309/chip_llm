  **Inputs:**

* `a`: An integer representing the first number
* `b`: An integer representing the second number

**Outputs:**

* `gcd_result`: An integer representing the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using simple arithmetic. The code first determines the minimum value of `a` and `b` using the `min()` function, and then iterates from the minimum value to 1 to find the common divisor. The loop continues until a common divisor is found or the variable `res` is greater than 1. The GCD is returned as the result of the `gcd()` function.

The `main()` function calls the `gcd()` function with the input values `a` and `b`, and prints the result to the console.

**SystemC Equivalent:**

The following SystemC code snippet provides an equivalent implementation of the provided C++/C code, while incorporating the provided signals for testbench integration:
```c++
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(GCD) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> gcd_result; // Output port for the GCD

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(GCD) {
        // Process to perform GCD calculation
        SC_METHOD(gcd);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to calculate the GCD of two integers
    void gcd() {
        int res = min(a.read(), b.read());  // Find the minimum of a and b
        while (res > 1) {
            if (a.read() % res == 0 && b.read() % res == 0)
                break;  // If a and b are divisible by res, we have found the GCD
            res--;
        }
        gcd_result.write(res);  // Write the GCD to the output port
    }
};
