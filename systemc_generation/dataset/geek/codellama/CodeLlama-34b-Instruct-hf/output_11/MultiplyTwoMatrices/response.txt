  **Inputs:**

* `mat1`: A 2D array of integers representing the first matrix.
* `mat2`: A 2D array of integers representing the second matrix.

**Outputs:**

* `rslt`: A 2D array of integers representing the product of `mat1` and `mat2`.

**Code Explanation:**

Line 15: The function `mulMat` takes two 2D arrays of integers as inputs and performs the matrix multiplication operation, storing the result in a 2D array called `rslt`.

Lines 17-24: The function first initializes `rslt` to be an empty 2D array.

Lines 26-32: The function then uses nested for loops to iterate through each element of `mat1` and `mat2`, multiplying the element of `mat1` by the corresponding element of `mat2` and adding the product to the corresponding element of `rslt`.

Lines 34-39: After the nested for loops complete, the function prints the resulting 2D array `rslt` to the console.

**SystemC Equivalent:**

Here is a SystemC code snippet that implements the same functionality as the original C++/C code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that multiplies two matrices
SC_MODULE(MatrixMultiplier) {
    sc_in<int> mat1[SIZE_A][SIZE_B]; // Input port for mat1
    sc_in<int> mat2[SIZE_B][SIZE_C]; // Input port for mat2
    sc_out<int> rslt[SIZE_A][SIZE_C]; // Output port for rslt

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatrixMultiplier) {
        // Process to perform matrix multiplication
        SC_METHOD(multiply);
        sensitive << mat1 << mat2;
    }

    // Method to multiply mat1 and mat2
    void multiply() {
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE_A; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE_B; j++) {
                rslt[i][j] = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < SIZE_C; k++) {
                    rslt[i][j] += mat1[i][k] * mat2[k][j];
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we create a module called `MatrixMultiplier` that takes two input ports: `mat1` and `mat2`, each of which is a 2D array of integers. The module also has an output port called `rslt`, which is also a 2D array of integers.

The constructor for the module declares a process called `multiply` that is sensitive to changes in both `mat1` and `mat2`. The process is implemented by the `multiply` method, which performs the matrix multiplication operation using nested for loops.

The result of the multiplication is stored in the `rslt` array, which is then passed out through the output port.

Note that in this SystemC code, we have defined the array dimensions using the preprocessor directives `#define` to make the code more flexible and reusable. The actual array dimensions can be specified at compile time by defining the appropriate values for `SIZE_A`, `SIZE_B`, and `SIZE_C`.
