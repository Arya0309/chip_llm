  **Inputs**:

* `n`: An integer value passed as an argument to the `decToBinary` function.

**Outputs**:

* Binary representation of `n` in the form of an integer array.

**Summary**:

The `decToBinary` function takes an integer input `n` and converts it to binary. It does this by using a for loop to perform the following operations:

* Calculate the remainder of `n / 2` and store it in an integer array called `binaryNum`.
* Divide `n` by 2 and store the result back into `n`.
* Increment the counter `i` to keep track of the number of bits processed.

Once the loop exits, the function prints the binary representation of `n` in reverse order using a for loop.

**Equivalent SystemC Code**:
```c++
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(decToBinary) {
  sc_in<int> dec;  // Input port for decimal value
  sc_out<int> binary;  // Output port for binary value

  // Constructor
  SC_CTOR(decToBinary) {
    // Process to convert decimal to binary
    SC_METHOD(convert);
    sensitive << dec;
  }

  // Method to perform the conversion
  void convert() {
    int binaryNum[32];
    int i = 0;
    int n = dec.read();
    while (n > 0) {
      binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
      n = n / 2;
      i++;
    }
    for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
      binary.write(binaryNum[j]);
    }
  }
};
```
In the above SystemC code, we've defined a module called `decToBinary` that takes an input port for the decimal value and an output port for the binary value. The constructor of the module initializes the conversion process by creating a process to perform the conversion. The process is sensitive to changes in the input port `dec`.

The `convert` method implements the conversion process. It first reads the input port `dec` to get the decimal value. Then, it uses a loop similar to the original C++ code to calculate the binary representation of the decimal value. Finally, it writes the binary representation back to the output port `binary`.

Note that we've defined the `binaryNum` array to have a fixed size of 32. This is to ensure that the SystemC code can be synthesized by the implementation tool. However, you may choose to use a dynamic allocation for the array to make the code more flexible.
