  **Inputs:**

* `arr`: An array of integers to be sorted.
* `n`: The size of the input array.

**Outputs:**

* `arr`: The sorted array of integers.

**Summary:**
The provided code is a C++ implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm, which is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. The algorithm divides the input array into two parts: a sorted subarray and an unsorted subarray. The code starts by sorting the smallest element in the unsorted subarray and placing it at the end of the sorted subarray. It then repeats this process by finding the next smallest element in the unsorted subarray and placing it next to the previously sorted element. This continues until the entire unsorted subarray has been sorted. The sorted array is then returned.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This line includes the standard header file for C++.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line tells the compiler to use the standard namespace for the code.
3. `void swap(int *xp, int *yp)`: This function takes two integer pointers as inputs and swaps the values they point to.
4. `void selectionSort(int arr[], int n)`: This function takes an array of integers and its size as inputs and sorts the array using the Selection Sort algorithm.
5. `int i, j, min_idx;`: These variables are declared as integers and are used to store temporary values during the sorting process.
6. `for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++)`: This line starts a for loop that iterates through the unsorted array, starting from the first element to the last.
7. `min_idx = i;`: This line sets the initial value of the minimum index to the current index.
8. `for (j = i+1; j < n; j++)`: This line starts a nested for loop that iterates through the remaining unsorted array elements, starting from the next element to the last.
9. `if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx])`: This line checks if the current element is less than the minimum element. If it is, the minimum index is updated to the current index.
10. `min_idx = j;`: This line updates the minimum index to the current index if the current element is less than the minimum element.
11. `swap(&arr[min_idx], &arr[i]);`: This line swaps the minimum element with the first unsorted element.
12. `void printArray(int arr[], int size)`: This function takes an array of integers and its size as inputs and prints the array.
13. `int main()`: This line is the main function of the program, which is the entry point of the program.
14. `int arr[] = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};`: This line declares an array of integers and initializes it with the values 64, 25, 12, 22, and 11.
15. `int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);`: This line calculates the size of the array.
16. `selectionSort(arr, n);`: This line sorts the array using the Selection Sort algorithm.
17. `cout << "Sorted array: ";` : This line prints a message to the console.
18. `printArray(arr, n);`: This line prints the sorted array.
19. `return 0;`: This line indicates the end of the main function.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to sort an array of integers using the Selection Sort algorithm
SC_MODULE(SelectionSort) {
    // Inputs
    sc_in<bool> clk; // Clock signal
    sc_in<bool> start; // Start signal
    sc_out<bool> done; // Done signal

    // Wires to store the number of elements in the array
    sc_in<int> num_elements;

    // Wires to store the input and output arrays
    sc_in<int> in_array[32];
    sc_out<int> out_array[32];

    void sort() {
        // Run the selection sort algorithm on the input array
        int i, j, min_idx;
        for (i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
            min_idx = i;
            for (j = i+1; j < num_elements; j++) {
                if (in_array[j] < in_array[min_idx]) {
                    min_idx = j;
                }
            }
            swap(in_array[min_idx], in_array[i]);
        }

        // Output the sorted array
        for (i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
            out_array[i] = in_array[i];
        }
    }

    SC_METHOD(sort)
    sensitive << clk.pos() << start.pos();

    // Acknowledge start signal and set done signal
    SC_CTOR(SelectionSort) {
        SC_CTHREAD(sort, clk.pos());
        reset_signal_is(done, 0);
    }

    void swap(int *xp, int *yp) {
        int temp = *xp;
        *xp = *yp;
        *yp = temp;
    }
```
Note that in the SystemC code, the `clk` signal is used to clock the `sort` method, and the `start` signal is used to start the sorting process. The `done` signal is used to indicate when the sorting process is complete. The `num_elements` wire is used to store the number of elements in the array, and the `in_array` and `out_array` wires are used to store the input and output arrays, respectively. The `sort` method runs the Selection Sort algorithm on the input array and outputs the sorted array. The `swap` function is used to swap elements in the input array.
