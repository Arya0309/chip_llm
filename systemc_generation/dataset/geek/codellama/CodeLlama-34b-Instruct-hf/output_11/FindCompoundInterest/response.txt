  **Input Signals:**

* `principal`: The principal amount of money invested.
* `rate`: The interest rate (as a percentage) per year.
* `time`: The time in years for which the principal amount will be invested.

**Output Signals:**

* `ci`: The compound interest calculated for the given principal, rate, and time.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code calculates the compound interest for a given principal amount of money invested at a given interest rate for a specified period of time. The code first declares a few variables: `principal`, `rate`, `time`, and `A`. The `principal` and `rate` variables are initialized with the values 10000 and 5, respectively. The `time` variable is initialized with the value 2.

The code then calculates the compound interest using the formula: `A = principal * (1 + (rate / 100)^time)`. The result is stored in the `A` variable. The code then calculates the compound interest by subtracting the principal amount from the calculated value of `A`. The compound interest is stored in the `CI` variable and printed to the console.

Here is a block-by-block explanation of the code:

1. `double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;`
Declares and initializes the variables `principal`, `rate`, and `time` with the values 10000, 5, and 2, respectively.
2. `double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));`
Calculates the compound interest using the formula: `A = principal * (1 + (rate / 100)^time)`. The result is stored in the `A` variable.
3. `double CI = A - principal;`
Calculates the compound interest by subtracting the principal amount from the calculated value of `A`. The compound interest is stored in the `CI` variable.
4. `cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;`
Prints the compound interest value to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CompoundInterest) {
    sc_in<double> principal;
    sc_in<double> rate;
    sc_in<double> time;
    sc_out<double> ci;

    void compute() {
        double A = principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100), time.read());
        double CI = A - principal.read();
        ci.write(CI);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `principal`, `rate`, and `time` signals are defined as `sc_in` ports, representing the input ports for the principal amount, interest rate, and time period, respectively. The `ci` signal is defined as an `sc_out` port, representing the output port for the compound interest.

The `compute` method is triggered by the `principal`, `rate`, and `time` signals. It calculates the compound interest using the same formula as the original C++/C code and writes the result to the `ci` signal.

The SystemC code can be used in a high-level synthesis flow by instantiating the `CompoundInterest` module and connecting it to the corresponding input and output signals.
