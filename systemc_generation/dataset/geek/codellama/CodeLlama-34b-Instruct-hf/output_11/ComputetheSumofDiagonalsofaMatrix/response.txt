  **Inputs and Outputs:**

* Inputs:
	+ `mat`: a 2D array of integers representing a square matrix
	+ `n`: the size of the matrix (i.e., the number of rows and columns)
* Outputs:
	+ `principal`: the sum of the elements on the principal diagonal of the matrix
	+ `secondary`: the sum of the elements on the secondary diagonal of the matrix

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code defines a function `printDiagonalSums` that takes a 2D array `mat` and its size `n` as input and outputs the sum of the elements on the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix. The function first initializes two variables `principal` and `secondary` to 0, and then iterates over the elements of the matrix using two nested loops.

In the outer loop, the function checks whether the row index `i` is equal to the column index `j`. If they are equal, the function adds the element at position `(i, j)` to the `principal` sum. If the sum of the row and column indices is equal to `n - 1`, the function adds the element at position `(i, j)` to the `secondary` sum. After iterating over all elements of the matrix, the function outputs the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals.

**SystemC Code:**

Here is a SystemC code snippet that implements the same logic as the provided C++/C code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSums) {
    sc_in<int> mat[SIZE];  // Input matrix
    sc_out<int> principal;  // Output sum of principal diagonal
    sc_out<int> secondary;  // Output sum of secondary diagonal

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSums) {
        // Process to compute the diagonal sums
        SC_METHOD(compute_diagonal_sums);
        sensitive << mat;
    }

    // Method to compute the diagonal sums
    void compute_diagonal_sums() {
        int principal = 0;  // Initialize the sum of the principal diagonal to 0
        int secondary = 0;  // Initialize the sum of the secondary diagonal to 0
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {  // Iterate over the rows of the matrix
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {  // Iterate over the columns of the matrix
                if (i == j) {  // If the row index is equal to the column index
                    principal += mat[i][j];  // Add the element to the principal sum
                } else if (i + j == SIZE - 1) {  // If the sum of the row and column indices is equal to SIZE - 1 (i.e., if it's on the secondary diagonal)
                    secondary += mat[i][j];  // Add the element to the secondary sum
                }
            }
        }
        principal.write(principal);  // Output the principal diagonal sum
        secondary.write(secondary);  // Output the secondary diagonal sum
    }
};
```
Note that the SystemC code uses the same `mat` input port as the provided C++/C code, but it also includes the `principal` and `secondary` output ports to output the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively. The `compute_diagonal_sums` method has the same logic as the original `printDiagonalSums` function, but it uses the `write` method to output the sums instead of using `cout`.
