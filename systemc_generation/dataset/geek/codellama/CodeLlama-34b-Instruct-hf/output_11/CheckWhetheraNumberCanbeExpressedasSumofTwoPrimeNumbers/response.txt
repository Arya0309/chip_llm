  **Inputs:**

* `n_in`: a positive integer

**Outputs:**

* `result_out`: a boolean indicating whether the input number `n_in` is a prime number that can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code defines two functions: `isPrime` and `isPossible`. `isPrime` takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it is a prime number using a for-loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any number between 2 and its square root, `isPrime` returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true`.

`isPossible` takes an integer `N` as input and checks if it is a prime number and if `N - 2` is also a prime number. If both conditions are met, `isPossible` returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The main function takes no input and simply checks if `n = 13` is a prime number that can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers using the `isPossible` function. If it is, it prints "Yes" to the console. Otherwise, it prints "No".

**SystemC Snippet:**

```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n_in;
    sc_out<bool> result_out;

    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        // Process to check if n_in is prime
        SC_METHOD(check_prime);
        sensitive << n_in;
        // Process to check if n_in can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers
        SC_METHOD(check_possible);
        sensitive << n_in;
    }

    // Method to check if n_in is prime
    void check_prime() {
        if (n_in.read() <= 1) {
            result_out.write(false);
            return;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i <= n_in.read(); i++) {
            if (n_in.read() % i == 0) {
                result_out.write(false);
                return;
            }
        }
        result_out.write(true);
    }

    // Method to check if n_in can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers
    void check_possible() {
        if (result_out.read() == true && n_in.read() - 2 >= 2) {
            result_out.write(true);
        } else {
            result_out.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

In this SystemC snippet, we define a `PrimeChecker` module that takes an `n_in` input port and a `result_out` output port. The `PrimeChecker` module has two clocked process `check_prime` and `check_possible`.

The `check_prime` process is triggered by the rising edge of the `n_in` input port. It first checks if the input `n_in` is less than or equal to 1, if it is, it writes `false` to `result_out` and returns. Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to `n_in` and checks if `n_in` is divisible by any number between 2 and its square root. If it is, it writes `false` to `result_out` and returns. Otherwise, it writes `true` to `result_out`.

The `check_possible` process is triggered by the rising edge of the `n_in` input port. It first checks if `result_out` is `true` and if `n_in - 2` is greater than or equal to 2. If both conditions are met, it writes `true` to `result_out`. Otherwise, it writes `false` to `result_out`.

Note that the `PrimeChecker` module uses a single clock signal to trigger the `check_prime` and `check_possible` processes simultaneously. This is different from the original C++/C code, where the `isPrime` function is called sequentially before the `isPossible` function.
