  **Inputs:**

* `year`: an integer representing the year to be checked

**Outputs:**

* `is_leap_year`: a boolean indicating whether the year is a leap year or not

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code checks if a given year is a leap year or not. The code first declares a function called `checkYear` that takes an integer argument `year`. The function checks if the year is divisible by 400, in which case it returns `true`. If the year is not divisible by 400, the function checks if it is divisible by 100, in which case it returns `false`. If the year is not divisible by 100, the function checks if it is divisible by 4, in which case it returns `true`. If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `false`.

In the `main` function, an input year is declared and passed to the `checkYear` function to check if it is a leap year or not. The result of the check is then printed to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    sc_in<int> year;
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;

    SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
        SC_METHOD(checkYear);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    void checkYear() {
        if (year.read() % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year.read() % 100 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        } else if (year.read() % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we define a module called `LeapYearChecker` that has an input port called `year` and an output port called `is_leap_year`. The module has a constructor that creates a process called `checkYear` that is sensitive to changes in the `year` input.

In the `checkYear` process, we use the same logic as in the C++/C code to check if the `year` is a leap year. We first check if the year is divisible by 400, and if so, we write `true` to the `is_leap_year` output. If the year is not divisible by 400, we check if it is divisible by 100, and if so, we write `false` to the `is_leap_year` output. If the year is not divisible by 100, we check if it is divisible by 4, and if so, we write `true` to the `is_leap_year` output. If none of the above conditions are met, we write `false` to the `is_leap_year` output.

The SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code, and the module can be used in a high-level synthesis flow without any modifications.
