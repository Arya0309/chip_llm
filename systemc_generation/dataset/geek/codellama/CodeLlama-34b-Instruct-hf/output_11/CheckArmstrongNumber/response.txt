  **Inputs**

* `num_in`: an integer signal that represents the user input number.

**Outputs**

* `is_armstrong`: a boolean signal that indicates whether the input number is an Armstrong number or not.

**Functional Description**

The program implements a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. It takes the user input number, calculates the sum of the cubes of its individual digits, and compares it to the original number. If the input number is equal to the sum, the program outputs "Yes. It is Armstrong No." else, it outputs "No. It is not an Armstrong No."

**Line-by-Line Explanation**

The program starts by declaring an integer variable `n` and initializing it to the value `153`. This value is the user input number. Then, it creates a temporary variable `temp` which is assigned the value of `n`.

The program then executes a loop that iterates until the value of `n` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 and stores it in the variable `rem`. It then calculates the cube of `rem` and adds it to the variable `p`. Finally, it updates the value of `n` by dividing it by 10 and repeats the process until the loop condition is satisfied.

Once the loop is completed, the program checks if the value of `p` is equal to the original input number `temp`. If it is, it outputs "Yes. It is Armstrong No." else, it outputs "No. It is not an Armstrong No."

**SystemC Code Snippet**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Armstrong) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong;

    sc_uint<32> n;
    sc_uint<32> temp;
    sc_uint<32> p;

    SC_CTOR(Armstrong) {
        SC_THREAD(check);
    }

    void check() {
        n = num_in.read();
        temp = n;
        p = 0;

        while (n > 0) {
            sc_uint<32> rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        if (temp == p) {
            is_armstrong.write(true);
        } else {
            is_armstrong.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code snippet, we have created a `Armstrong` module that takes the input integer `num_in` and outputs a boolean signal `is_armstrong`.

The module has four internal variables: `n`, `temp`, `p` and `rem`. `n` is the input number, `temp` is a temporary variable that holds the input number, `p` is the running sum of the cubes of the individual digits, and `rem` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10.

The `check` thread runs in an infinite loop and performs the necessary calculations and assignments to the internal variables. It reads the input number from `num_in` and initializes `temp` with the same value. Then it iterates through the digits of `n` using a while loop, computes the cube of each digit and adds it to `p`. Finally, it checks if `temp` is equal to `p` and writes the appropriate boolean value to `is_armstrong`.
