  **Inputs**:

* `a`: An integer input representing the first number.
* `b`: An integer input representing the second number.

**Outputs**:

* `gcd_result`: An integer output representing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two input numbers.

**Summary**:

The provided C++/C code is a simple algorithm for computing the GCD of two integers. It takes two integer inputs `a` and `b` and returns their GCD in the output `gcd_result`. The algorithm works as follows:

1. The function `gcd(a, b)` is called with the two input numbers.
2. The minimum of `a` and `b` is determined using the `min()` function.
3. The variable `res` is initialized to the minimum value.
4. A loop is executed starting from `res` and decrementing `res` by 1 until it reaches 1 or the division of `a` and `b` by `res` has a remainder of 0.
5. If the division has a remainder of 0, `res` is set to the GCD of `a` and `b`.
6. The GCD is returned as the output.

**SystemC Code**:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that computes the GCD of two integers
SC_MODULE(GCD) {
    sc_in<int> a; // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b; // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> gcd_result; // Output port for the GCD

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(GCD) {
        // Process to perform the GCD computation
        SC_METHOD(compute_gcd);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to compute the GCD
    void compute_gcd() {
        int res = min(a.read(), b.read());

        while (res > 1) {
            if ((a.read() % res == 0) && (b.read() % res == 0)) {
                break;
            }
            res--;
        }

        gcd_result.write(res);
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, the `GCD` module has three ports: two input ports for the two integers `a` and `b`, and an output port for the GCD `gcd_result`. The `compute_gcd()` method is a process that is sensitive to changes in `a` and `b` and computes the GCD using the same algorithm as the original C++/C code. The output `gcd_result` is set to the GCD when the method completes.

The SystemC code incorporates the same signals as the original C++/C code, `a`, `b`, and `gcd_result`, and computes the GCD of `a` and `b` using the same algorithm as the original code.
