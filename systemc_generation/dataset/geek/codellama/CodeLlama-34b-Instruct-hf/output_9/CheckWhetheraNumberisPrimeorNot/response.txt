  **Inputs:**

* The input signal `n` is an integer that represents the number to be checked for primality.

**Outputs:**

* The output signal `is_prime` is a boolean value that indicates whether the number is prime or not.

**Summary:**

The given C++ code is a simple trial division algorithm to check whether a given number is prime or not. The code takes an integer input `n` and checks if it is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the number is not prime and the output is "NOT prime".

If the number is greater than 1, the code checks whether it is divisible by any number between 1 and itself (inclusive). If it is divisible by more than 2 numbers, the number is not prime and the output is "NOT prime". Otherwise, the number is prime and the output is "prime".

**SystemC code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks for primality using Simple Trial Division
SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n; // Input port for the number to be checked
    sc_out<bool> is_prime; // Output port for the primality result

    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        // Process to perform the primality check
        SC_METHOD(check_primality);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    void check_primality() {
        int cnt = 0; // Counter for the number of divisible numbers

        if (n <= 1) {
            // If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime
            is_prime.write(false);
        } else {
            // Check for divisors from 1 to n
            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                if (n % i == 0) {
                    // If the number is divisible by another number, increment the counter
                    cnt++;
                }
            }
            // If the number is divisible by more than 1 number, it is not prime
            if (cnt > 1) {
                is_prime.write(false);
            } else {
                // If the number is not divisible by any other number, it is prime
                is_prime.write(true);
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code above, we have defined a module `PrimeChecker` that takes an input signal `n` and an output signal `is_prime`. The module contains a process `check_primality` that checks the primality of the input number using the same algorithm used in the C++ code. The process is sensitive to changes in the input signal `n` and updates the output signal `is_prime` accordingly.

Note that we have used the same variable names and coding style as in the C++ code to ensure readability and maintainability. Additionally, we have incorporated the input and output signals defined in the problem statement (`n` and `is_prime`) into the SystemC code to ensure seamless integration with the testbench.
