  **Inputs:**

* `num`: An array of integers to be sorted.
* `len`: The length of the input array.

**Outputs:**

* None.

**Summary**:

The provided C++ code is a program that sorts an array of integers using the bubble sort algorithm. It takes in a input array of integers and its length as arguments and sorts the array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The code first prints the unsorted array and then sorts it using the bubble sort algorithm. Finally, the sorted array is printed.

The bubble sort algorithm works by repeatedly iterating over the array, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.

The code uses a bool variable `isSwapped` to keep track of whether any swaps occurred during the current pass through the array. If no swaps occur, it means the array is sorted and the sorting process can terminate.

**SystemC Equivalent**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that sorts an array of integers using bubble sort
SC_MODULE(BubbleSort) {
    sc_in<int> nums[LEN];  // Input port for the array of integers
    sc_in<int> len;  // Input port for the length of the array
    sc_out<bool> done;  // Output port to indicate whether sorting is complete

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BubbleSort) {
        // Process to perform bubble sort
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << len;
    }

    // Method to sort the array using bubble sort
    void sort() {
        bool isSwapped;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            isSwapped = false;
            for (int j = 1; j < len - i; j++) {
                if (nums[j] < nums[j - 1]) {
                    sc_tmp swap = nums[j];
                    nums[j] = nums[j - 1];
                    nums[j - 1] = swap;
                    isSwapped = true;
                }
            }
            if (!isSwapped)
                done.write(true);
        }
    }
};
```
In the above SystemC code, we have defined a module `BubbleSort` that takes in an array of integers and its length as inputs, and has an output `done` port to indicate whether sorting is complete.

The `BubbleSort` module contains a process `sort` that performs the bubble sort algorithm. It iterates over the array, compares adjacent pairs of elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It also keeps track of whether any swaps occur during the current pass through the array using the `isSwapped` variable. If no swaps occur, it means the array is sorted and the sorting process can terminate.

The `BubbleSort` module also contains a temporary variable `sc_tmp swap` to store the swap values.

The `done` port is written to `true` when the array is sorted, and the sorting process completes.
