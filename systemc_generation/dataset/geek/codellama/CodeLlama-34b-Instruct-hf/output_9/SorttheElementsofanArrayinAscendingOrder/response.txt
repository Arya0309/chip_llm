  The provided C++/C code is a program that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The input of the code is the array of integers and the output is the sorted array.

The program first initializes an array of integers and prints it to the console. Then, it calls the `sort` function, which sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm. Finally, the program prints the sorted array to the console.

The `sort` function first iterates over the array, from the beginning to the end, and for each element, it compares it with the next element in the array. If the current element is larger than the next element, the function swaps them in the array. This process continues until the end of the array is reached. Then, the function moves on to the next element and repeats the process. This process continues until no more swaps are made, which means that the array is sorted.

The `swapNums` function is used to swap two elements in the array. It receives the array, the index of the first element to be swapped, and the index of the second element to be swapped as input. It swaps the two elements in the array and returns nothing.

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BubbleSort) {
    sc_in<bool> clk;
    sc_in<bool> start;
    sc_out<bool> done;
    sc_in<int> nums[];
    sc_in<int> len;

    // Method to sort the array using bubble sort
    void sort() {
        bool isSwapped;
        int i, j;

        // Clk-based cycle to iterate over the array
        clk.wait();
        for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            isSwapped = false;
            for (j = 1; j < len - i; j++) {
                if (nums[j] < nums[j - 1]) {
                    swapNums(nums, j, (j - 1));
                    isSwapped = true;
                }
            }
            if (!isSwapped) break;
        }
        done.write(true);
    }

    // Method to swap two elements in the array
    void swapNums(sc_in<int> nums[], int first, int second) {
        int curr = nums[first];
        nums[first] = nums[second];
        nums[second] = curr;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `BubbleSort` module has three input ports: `clk`, `start`, and `nums`, and one output port, `done`. The `sort` method is called when the `start` input is asserted. It sorts the `nums` array using the bubble sort algorithm and signals `done` when the sorting is complete. The `swapNums` method is used to swap two elements in the array.

Note that in the above SystemC code, the `clk` signal is used to implement a clk-based cycle for iterating over the array. This is necessary because SystemC does not have a built-in mechanism for modeling sequential logic, such as the bubble sort algorithm. The `swapNums` method is used to swap two elements in the array, as in the original C++/C code. The rest of the logic is the same as in the original code, with some minor modifications to account for the fact that we are working with SystemC ports rather than C++ variables.
