  **Inputs:**

* `n`: The number of Fibonacci numbers to compute the sum of.

**Outputs:**

* `sum`: The sum of the even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to `n` terms.

**Code Summary:**

1. The code includes the `stdc++` header file, which provides various standard C++ libraries, and the `std` namespace is used.
2. The `calculateEvenSum` function computes the value of the first `2*n+1` Fibonacci numbers and stores the even-indexed sum.
3. The function takes an integer `n` as input.
4. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 0.
5. An array `fibo` of size `2*n+1` is declared and initialized to 0 for all indices.
6. The first two elements of the array are set to 0 and 1, respectively.
7. A variable `sum` is declared and initialized to 0.
8. A loop is executed from 2 to `2*n`, where each iteration computes the next Fibonacci number and adds it to the sum if the current index is even.
9. The function returns the value of the sum.
10. In the `main` function, the `n` value is set to 8.
11. The `calculateEvenSum` function is called with `n` as the input, and the result is printed to the console.
12. The program ends.

**SystemC Code Snippet:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(FibonacciSum) {
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<int> sum;

    SC_CTOR(FibonacciSum) {
        SC_METHOD(calculateEvenSum);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    void calculateEvenSum() {
        int fibo[2 * n + 1];
        fibo[0] = 0, fibo[1] = 1;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= 2 * n; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                fibo[i] = fibo[i - 1] + fibo[i - 2];
                sum += fibo[i];
            }
        }
        sum.write(sum);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `FibonacciSum` module is defined with `n` as the input and `sum` as the output. The `calculateEvenSum` method is declared as sensitive to changes in `n`, and it computes the even-indexed Fibonacci numbers and their sum up to `n` terms. The result is written to the `sum` output port. The `FibonacciSum` module can be instantiated in a SystemC testbench, and the `calculateEvenSum` method can be triggered by changing the value of `n`.
