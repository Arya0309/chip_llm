  **Inputs:**

1. The matrix 'm' (with dimensions specified by the 'n' constant).
2. The element at (0, 0) of the matrix 'm'.
3. The element at (0, n-1) of the matrix 'm'.

**Outputs:**

1. The modified matrix 'm' with the first and last columns swapped.

**Line-by-Line Summary:**

1. The first input 'm' is defined as a two-dimensional array of integers with dimensions specified by the constant 'n'.
2. The function 'interchangeFirstLast' is declared, which takes a two-dimensional array of integers 'm' as input.
3. The function loops for 'n' iterations, where each iteration i represents a row of the matrix.
4. Inside the for loop, two temporary integers 't' and 'm[i][0]' are created.
5. The value of 't' is set to the current value of 'm[i][0]'.
6. The value of 'm[i][0]' is then set to the value of 'm[i][n-1]' (the last element of the current row).
7. The value of 'm[i][n-1]' is then set to the temporary value of 't'.
8. The for loop continues until all rows have been processed.
9. The function 'interchangeFirstLast' is then called with the input matrix 'm'.
10. The program then enters the 'main' function.
11. An integer matrix 'm' with hardcoded values is defined.
12. The function 'interchangeFirstLast' is called with the input matrix 'm'.
13. The program then prints out the modified matrix 'm' to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

#define n 4

SC_MODULE(MatrixSwapper) {
    sc_in<int> m[n][n];  // Input matrix
    sc_out<int> out_m;  // Output matrix

    SC_CTOR(MatrixSwapper) {
        // Process to swap first and last columns
        SC_METHOD(swapColumns);
        sensitive << m;
    }

    void swapColumns() {
        // Loop through each row and swap the first and last elements
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int t = m[i][0];
            m[i][0] = m[i][n-1];
            m[i][n-1] = t;
        }
        // Output the modified matrix
        out_m.write(m);
    }
};
```
In the above SystemC code, the 'm' input array is defined as an array of integers with dimensions specified by the 'n' constant. The 'out_m' output array is also defined as an array of integers with dimensions specified by the 'n' constant.

The 'swapColumns' process is defined to swap the first and last columns of the input matrix 'm'. The process is triggered whenever there is a change in the 'm' input signal.

Inside the 'swapColumns' process, we loop through each row of the input matrix 'm' and swap the first and last elements. The swapped matrix is then output to the 'out_m' signal.

Note that the SystemC code is written to preserve the logic of the original C++/C code, but it is not optimized for performance or resource utilization. The SystemC code can be further optimized for high-level synthesis by using appropriate coding techniques and optimization tools.
