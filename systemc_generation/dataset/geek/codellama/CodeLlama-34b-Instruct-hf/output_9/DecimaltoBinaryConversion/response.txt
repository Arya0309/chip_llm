  **Inputs and Outputs:**

* Inputs:
	+ `dec_in`: an integer input signal representing the decimal number to be converted to binary.
	+ `binary_out`: an integer output signal representing the binary representation of the input decimal number.
* Outputs:
	+ `binary_out`: the binary representation of the input decimal number.

**Line-by-Line Analysis:**

The provided C++/C code defines a function `decToBinary` that takes a decimal number as input and converts it to binary. The function consists of two parts:

1. **`decToBinary` Function:**
The function starts by defining an array `binaryNum` of type `int` with a size of 32 to store the binary representation of the input decimal number. It also declares an integer variable `i` to keep track of the index of the binary array.

The function then enters a loop that iterates while the input decimal number `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 2 and stores it in the `binaryNum` array at index `i`. It then increments `i` and divides `n` by 2. This process continues until `n` is 0, at which point the loop exits.

2. **Loop Body:**
The loop body consists of three statements:

a. `binaryNum[i] = n % 2;`: This statement calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 2 and stores it in the `binaryNum` array at index `i`.

b. `n = n / 2;`: This statement divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`.

c. `i++;`: This statement increments the `i` index of the `binaryNum` array by 1.

3. **`main` Function:**
The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It declares an `int` variable `n` and assigns it the value 10. It then calls the `decToBinary` function with `n` as the argument. Finally, it returns 0.

**SystemC Code:**

The following SystemC code implements the logic of the C++/C code in a way that is compatible with our existing testbench:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DecToBinary) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;
    sc_out<int> binary_out;

    SC_CTOR(DecToBinary) {
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    void convert() {
        int n = dec_in.read();
        int binaryNum[32];
        int i = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }
        binary_out.write(binaryNum);
    }
};
```
The SystemC code consists of a `DecToBinary` module that takes an integer input signal `dec_in` and an integer output signal `binary_out`. It also declares an integer array `binaryNum` to store the binary representation of the input decimal number.

The `SC_METHOD` statement defines a method `convert` that is triggered whenever the `dec_in` signal changes. The method first reads the input decimal number from the `dec_in` signal and initializes the `i` index of the `binaryNum` array to 0.

The method then enters a loop that iterates while the input decimal number `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 2 and stores it in the `binaryNum` array at index `i`. It then increments `i` and divides `n` by 2. This process continues until `n` is 0, at which point the loop exits.

Finally, the method writes the contents of the `binaryNum` array to the `binary_out` signal.
