  **Inputs**:

* n_in: an integer input signal that represents the number to be checked.

**Outputs**:

* result_out: a boolean output signal that indicates whether the input number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

**Line-by-line summary**:

* `// C++ program to check if a prime number can be expressed as sum of two Prime Numbers`: This is a comment that provides a brief description of the code's purpose.
* `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is the header file that includes various C++ libraries.
* `using namespace std;`: This line makes the standard namespace available for use in the code.
* `bool isPrime(int n)`: This function takes an integer input `n` and returns `true` if `n` is a prime number and `false` otherwise.
* `if (n <= 1) return false;`: This line checks if the input number `n` is less than or equal to 1, and returns `false` if it is.
* `for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++)`: This is a loop that iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`.
* `if (n % i == 0) return false;`: This line checks if the input number `n` is divisible by the current loop variable `i`, and returns `false` if it is.
* `return true;`: This line returns `true` if the input number `n` is not divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n`.
* `bool isPossible(int N)`: This function takes an integer input `N` and returns `true` if the input number `N` can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, and `false` otherwise.
* `if (isPrime(N) && isPrime(N - 2)) return true;`: This line checks if the input number `N` and `N-2` are prime numbers, and returns `true` if they are.
* `return false;`: This line returns `false` if the input number `N` is not prime or if `N-2` is not prime.
* `int main()`: This is the main function that runs the code.
* `int n = 13;`: This line declares a variable `n` and initializes it to 13.
* `if (isPossible(n)) cout << "Yes";`: This line checks if the input number `n` can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers using the `isPossible` function, and prints "Yes" if it can.
* `else cout << "No";`: This line prints "No" if the input number `n` cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
* `return 0;`: This line returns 0 to indicate that the program has terminated successfully.

**SystemC Implementation**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks if a number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers
SC_MODULE(PrimeSumChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n_in;  // Input port for the number to be checked
    sc_out<bool> result_out;  // Output port for the result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PrimeSumChecker) {
        // Process to perform the check
        SC_METHOD(check);
        sensitive << n_in;
    }

    // Method to perform the check
    void check() {
        int n = n_in.read();
        if (n <= 1) {
            result_out.write(false);
        } else {
            for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
                if (n % i == 0) {
                    result_out.write(false);
                    return;
                }
            }
            result_out.write(true);
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC implementation, we define a module called `PrimeSumChecker` that takes an integer input `n_in` and produces a boolean output `result_out`. The module has a single process called `check` that performs the check for whether the input number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The process is triggered by changes to the `n_in` port. The `check` method first checks if the input number `n` is less than or equal to 1, and if so, sets the output to `false`. Otherwise, it checks if the input number `n` is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n`, and if so, sets the output to `false`. If the input number `n` is not divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n`, the output is set to `true`.

Note that in the SystemC implementation, we have used the signal `n_in` and `result_out` to capture the input and output ports of the module. The `n_in` signal is read from the input port and the `result_out` signal is written to the output port.
