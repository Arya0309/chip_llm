  **Inputs**:

* `mat`: a 2D integer array representing a matrix with dimensions `n x n`, where `n` is an integer.
* `n`: an integer denoting the size of the matrix.

**Outputs**:

* `principal`: an integer representing the sum of the principal diagonal of the matrix.
* `secondary`: an integer representing the sum of the secondary diagonal of the matrix.

**Line-by-Line Explanation**:

1. `const int MAX = 100;`: This line defines a constant integer variable called `MAX` with a value of 100.
2. `int mat[][MAX];`: This line declares a 2D integer array called `mat` with dimensions `n x MAX`, where `n` is an integer.
3. `int n;`: This line declares an integer variable called `n`.
4. `void printDiagonalSums(int mat[][MAX], int n) {`: This line starts the definition of a function called `printDiagonalSums` that takes two parameters: an integer 2D array `mat` and an integer `n`.
5. `int principal = 0, secondary = 0;`: This line initializes two integer variables called `principal` and `secondary` to 0.
6. `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {`: This line starts a for loop that iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
7. `for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {`: This line starts a nested for loop that iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
8. `if (i == j) primary += mat[i][j];`: This line checks if the current row and column index are the same, and if they are, it adds the element at that index to the `principal` variable.
9. `else if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) secondary += mat[i][j];`: This line checks if the current row and column index add up to `n-1`, and if they do, it adds the element at that index to the `secondary` variable.
10. `cout << "Principal Diagonal:" << principal << endl;`: This line prints the value of the `principal` variable to the console with a label indicating that it represents the sum of the principal diagonal.
11. `cout << "Secondary Diagonal:" << secondary << endl;`: This line prints the value of the `secondary` variable to the console with a label indicating that it represents the sum of the secondary diagonal.
12. `return 0;`: This line ends the function and returns a value of 0.
13. `int main() {`: This line starts the definition of the `main` function.
14. `int a[][MAX] = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, ...};`: This line defines a 2D integer array called `a` with values.
15. `printDiagonalSums(a, 4);`: This line calls the `printDiagonalSums` function with argument `a` and `n` equal to 4.
16. `return 0;`: This line ends the `main` function and returns a value of 0.

**SystemC Code Snippet**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSums) {
    sc_in<int> mat_in;
    sc_out<int> principal_out;
    sc_out<int> secondary_out;

    void findDiagonalSums() {
        int n = mat_in.read();
        int principal = 0;
        int secondary = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == j) {
                    principal += mat_in.read();
                } else if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) {
                    secondary += mat_in.read();
                }
            }
        }
        principal_out.write(principal);
        secondary_out.write(secondary);
    }

    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSums) {
        SC_THREAD(findDiagonalSums);
        sensitive << mat_in;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code snippet, we define a module called `DiagonalSums` that contains three ports: `mat_in` for input, `principal_out` for output, and `secondary_out` for output. The `findDiagonalSums` function calculates the principal and secondary diagonal sums based on the input matrix size and the values in the matrix. The function is called in the `SC_CTOR` block to perform the calculations whenever the `mat_in` port changes. The results are then written to the `principal_out` and `secondary_out` ports using the `write` function.

Note that this SystemC code uses the `sc_in` and `sc_out` ports, which are instantiated in the testbench to connect to the `principal` and `secondary` signals defined in the original C++/C code.
