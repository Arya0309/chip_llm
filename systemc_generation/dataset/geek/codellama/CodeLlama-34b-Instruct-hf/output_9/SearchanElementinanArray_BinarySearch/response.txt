  **Inputs:**

* `v`: a vector of integer values
* `target`: an integer value to be searched in the vector

**Outputs:**

* Boolean value indicating whether the `target` value is present in the `v` vector or not.

**Line-by-Line Summary:**

1. The code starts by including the required header files.
2. The `binarySearch` function takes two inputs: a reference to a vector of integers, and an integer value to be searched. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the target value is present in the vector or not.
3. The function then initializes two integer variables, `low` and `high`, to the beginning and end indices of the vector, respectively.
4. The `while` loop checks if the `low` index is less than or equal to the `high` index. If the condition is true, the function proceeds to the next step. If not, it means that the vector has been searched exhaustively, and the function returns `false`.
5. The function calculates the middle index of the vector using the formula `mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low`.
6. The function checks if the value at the middle index is equal to the `target` value. If it is, the function returns `true`.
7. If the value at the middle index is greater than the `target` value, the function updates the `high` index to be the mid-1 index.
8. Otherwise, the function updates the `low` index to be the mid+1 index.
9. The function then repeats the loop from step 4.
10. After the loop ends, the function returns `false`, indicating that the `target` value was not found in the vector.

**SystemC Code:**
```sc_module (Adder) {
  sc_in<int> v[num_elements]; // Declare an array of input ports
  sc_in<int> target; // Declare an input port for the target value
  sc_out<bool> found; // Declare an output port for the found flag

  // Define the add method
  void add() {
    int low = 0; // Initialize the low index to 0
    int high = num_elements - 1; // Initialize the high index to the last index of the array
    int mid; // Initialize the mid index to 0
    int counter = 0; // Initialize the counter to 0

    while (low <= high) {
      // Calculate the mid index
      mid = (high - low) / 2 + low;

      // Check if the value at the mid index is equal to the target
      if (v[mid] == target) {
        found.write(true); // Writing true to the found port
        break; // Break out of the loop
      }

      // Check if the value at the mid index is greater than the target
      if (v[mid] > target) {
        high = mid - 1; // Update the high index
      } else {
        low = mid + 1; // Update the low index
      }

      // Increment the counter
      counter++;
    }

    // If the counter is equal to the number of elements in the array, then the target is not found
    if (counter == num_elements) {
      found.write(false); // Writing false to the found port
    }
  }
};
```
In the above SystemC code, we use an array of input ports (`v`) to represent the binary search vector, and an input port (`target`) to represent the target value. We also use an output port (`found`) to represent the found flag.

The `add` method implements the binary search algorithm. It starts by initializing the `low`, `high`, and `mid` indices to 0, the last index of the array, and 0, respectively. It also initializes a `counter` to 0.

The method then enters a `while` loop that checks if the `low` index is less than or equal to the `high` index. If the condition is true, the method proceeds to the next step. If not, it means that the vector has been searched exhaustively, and the method returns `false`.

The method then calculates the `mid` index using the formula `mid = (high - low) / 2 + low;`. It then checks if the value at the `mid` index is equal to the `target` value. If it is, the method writes `true` to the `found` port and breaks out of the loop.

If the value at the `mid` index is greater than the `target` value, the method updates the `high` index to be the `mid` index minus 1. Otherwise, it updates the `low` index to be the `mid` index plus 1.

The method then increments the `counter` by 1.

After the loop ends, the method checks if the `counter` is equal to the number of elements in the array. If it is, then the `target` value is not found, and the method writes `false` to the `found` port.

Note that the output port `found` is updated throughout the search process, so the user can monitor the progress of the search and the final result.
