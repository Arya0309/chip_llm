  **Inputs**:

* `real1`: The real part of the first complex number.
* `imag1`: The imaginary part of the first complex number.
* `real2`: The real part of the second complex number.
* `imag2`: The imaginary part of the second complex number.

**Outputs**:

* `real_sum`: The real part of the sum of the two complex numbers.
* `imag_sum`: The imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers.

**Line-by-Line Analysis**:

1. The first line includes the necessary libraries for the C++ program to run.
2. The next line defines a user-defined class called "Complex" to represent complex numbers.
3. The next five lines define the variables and constructor for the Complex class.
4. The next line defines the addComp() method, which takes two Complex objects as input and returns a Complex object that represents the sum of the two inputs.
5. The main() function creates two Complex objects, C1 and C2, with the real and imaginary parts 3 and 2 and 9 and 5, respectively.
6. The next two lines print the values of C1 and C2.
7. The next line creates a new Complex object, C3, and calls the addComp() method on it with C1 and C2 as inputs.
8. The last line prints the values of C3, which should be the sum of C1 and C2.

**SystemC Code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;
    sc_in<int> imag1;
    sc_in<int> real2;
    sc_in<int> imag2;
    sc_out<int> real_sum;
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;

    void add() {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }

    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, two input ports are defined for each of the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers, and two output ports are defined for the real and imaginary parts of the sum. The add() method takes the inputs from the input ports, adds them, and writes the results to the output ports. The SC_METHOD macro is used to specify the method that will be called when any of the sensitive input ports change value.
