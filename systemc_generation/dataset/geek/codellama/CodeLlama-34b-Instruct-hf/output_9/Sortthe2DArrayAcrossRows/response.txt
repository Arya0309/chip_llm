  **Inputs and Outputs:**
The input is a 2D matrix (int m[][4]) of size r x c (r rows, c columns) passed to the function sortRowWise. The output is the sorted matrix printed to the console.

**Code Summary:**
The code defines a function sortRowWise that takes the 2D matrix and its dimensions as inputs. It first initializes a temporary matrix using the input matrix. Then, it loops through each row of the matrix and sorts it in ascending order using a swap function. Finally, it prints the sorted matrix to the console.

The swap function takes two integer pointers as input and swaps their values.

**SystemC Code:**
Here's an equivalent SystemC code for the given C++/C code:
```c++
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SortRowWise) {
    sc_fifo<int> fifo_in, fifo_out;
    sc_out<bool> done;

    SC_CTOR(SortRowWise) {
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << start;
    }

    void sort() {
        int r = fifo_in.size();
        int c = fifo_in.front().size();
        int temp;

        // loop for rows of matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            // loop for column of matrix
            for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                // loop for comparison and swapping
                for (int k = 0; k < c - j - 1; k++) {
                    if (fifo_in[i][k] > fifo_in[i][k + 1]) {
                        temp = fifo_in[i][k];
                        fifo_in[i][k] = fifo_in[i][k + 1];
                        fifo_in[i][k + 1] = temp;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        done = true;
    }
};
```
In this code, we define a SystemC module called SortRowWise that has two FIFOs (fifo_in and fifo_out) for input and output, respectively. It also has a done signal to indicate the completion of the sort operation.

The sorting function (sort) is a SystemC method that is triggered by the start signal. It first determines the number of rows (r) and columns (c) of the input matrix. It then loops through each row and column of the matrix, sorting each row in ascending order using the same swap function as in the original C++/C code.

After sorting, it sets the done signal to true to indicate that the sort operation is complete.

We have incorporated the signals defined above in our SystemC code by defining the done signal based on the start signal. The rest of the code is self-explanatory and follows the logic of the original C++/C code.
