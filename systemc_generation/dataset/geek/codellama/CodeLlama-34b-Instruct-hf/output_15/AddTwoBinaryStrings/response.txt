  **Inputs:**

* `A`: A binary string representing the first number to be added.
* `B`: A binary string representing the second number to be added.

**Outputs:**

* `sum`: A binary string representing the sum of `A` and `B`.

**Major Line-by-Line Analysis:**

1. The function `addBinary(string A, string B)` takes two binary strings `A` and `B` as input and returns their sum as a third binary string.
2. The function first checks if the length of `A` is greater than the length of `B`. If so, it swaps the strings by calling the same function and returns the result. This is done to ensure that `A` is always the longer string, which simplifies the addition process.
3. The function then calculates the difference between the lengths of the two strings (`diff = B.length() - A.length()`).
4. It initializes a padding string `padding` with `diff` number of '0's.
5. Prepends `padding` to `A` to make sure that `A` is the same length as `B` (`A = padding + A`).
6. Initializes a string `res` to store the result of the addition.
7. Initializes a character `carry` to '0', which is used to store the carry-over value in the addition process.
8. The function then iterates over each character of `A` and `B` from right to left and performs the following operations:
	1. If both characters are '1', it checks the value of `carry`. If `carry` is '1', it sets the next character of `res` to '1' and sets `carry` to '1'. If `carry` is '0', it sets the next character of `res` to '0' and sets `carry` to '1'.
	2. If both characters are '0', it checks the value of `carry`. If `carry` is '1', it sets the next character of `res` to '1' and sets `carry` to '0'. If `carry` is '0', it sets the next character of `res` to '0' and sets `carry` to '0'.
	3. If the characters are not the same ('1' and '0' or '0' and '1'), it sets the next character of `res` to the non-zero character and sets `carry` to the sum of the carry-over and the non-zero character modulo 2.
9. If there is a carry-over value at the end, it appends it to the result string.
10. If the result string has leading '0's, it removes them.
11. Returns the result string.
