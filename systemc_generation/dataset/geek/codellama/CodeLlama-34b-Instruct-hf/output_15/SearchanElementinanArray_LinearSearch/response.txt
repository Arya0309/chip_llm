  **Linear Search Algorithm in C++/C**

Inputs:

* `vector<int> v`: A vector of integers to be searched.
* `int key`: An integer value to be searched in `v`.

Outputs:

* `int`: The index of the `key` in the `vector` if found, otherwise `-1`.

**Linear Search Algorithm**

The linear search algorithm searches for the given key in the vector `v` by iterating through each element of the vector and comparing it with the `key`. The algorithm returns the index of the first instance of the `key` in the vector, if found. Otherwise, it returns `-1`.

**Line-by-Line Summary**

1. The algorithm starts by defining the inputs and outputs of the function.
2. The algorithm then initializes a variable `i` to 0, which will be used to iterate through the vector.
3. The algorithm then enters a loop that will iterate through the vector and compare each element with the `key`.
4. If the `key` is found, the index of the `key` is returned.
5. If the `key` is not found, the algorithm returns `-1`.

**SystemC Equivalent**

The following SystemC code is a SystemC equivalent of the linear search algorithm. It utilizes the signals `key`, `index`, and `data` to mimic the behavior of the original C++/C code. The `sc_in<int> key` signal is used to input the `key` value, the `sc_out<int> index` signal is used to output the index of the `key` in the `vector`, and the `sc_vector< sc_in<int> > data` signal is used to input the `vector` of integers.
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that implements a linear search algorithm iteratively
SC_MODULE(LinearSearch) {
    sc_in<int> key;  // Input port for the key
    sc_out<int> index;  // Output port for the index of the key
    sc_vector< sc_in<int> > data;  // Input port for the vector of integers

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LinearSearch) {
        // Process to perform the linear search
        SC_METHOD(search);
        sensitive << key << data;
    }

    // Method to perform the linear search
    void search() {
        // Initialize the index to 0
        int i = 0;

        // Iterate through the vector and compare each element with the key
        while (i < data.size()) {
            if (data[i].read() == key.read()) {
                // If the key is found, write the index to the index port
                index.write(i);
                break;
            }
            ++i;
        }

        // If the key is not found, write -1 to the index port
        if (i == data.size()) {
            index.write(-1);
        }
    }
};
```
Note that the SystemC code utilizes the same inputs and outputs as the original C++/C code, but the logic is rewritten to utilize SystemC signals and ports. The `key` signal is used to input the `key` value, the `index` signal is used to output the index of the `key` in the `vector`, and the `data` vector of integers is used to input the `vector` of integers. The `search` method performs the linear search algorithm by iterating through the `data` vector and comparing each element with the `key` value. If the `key` is found, the `index` port is written with the index of the `key`. If the `key` is not found, the `index` port is written with `-1`.
