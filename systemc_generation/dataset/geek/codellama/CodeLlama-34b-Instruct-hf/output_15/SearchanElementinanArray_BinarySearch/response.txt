  **Inputs**:

* `target`: The value to be searched for in the vector `v`.
* `v`: The vector to be searched.

**Outputs**:

* `found`: A boolean value indicating whether the target value was found in the vector.

**Code Summary**:

The code defines a function `binarySearch` that takes two vectors as input: `v` and `target`. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the target value was found in the vector.

The function starts by defining the upper and lower bounds of the vector to be searched: `low = 0` and `high = v.size() - 1`.

The function then enters a `while` loop that continues until the element is found or the vector cannot be divided into more parts.

Inside the loop, the middle element of the vector is calculated: `mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low`.

The function then checks if the middle element is equal to the target value. If it is, the function returns `true`.

If the middle element is greater than the target value, the function sets `high` to `mid - 1` and continues searching the left half of the vector. If the middle element is less than the target value, the function sets `low` to `mid + 1` and continues searching the right half of the vector.

If the loop ends without finding the target value, the function returns `false`.

**SystemC Code**:

Here is the SystemC code that reflects the same behavior as the original C++/C source:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinarySearch) {
    sc_in<int> target; // Input port for the target value
    sc_in<int> v_size; // Input port for the size of the vector
    sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v; // Input port for the vector to be searched
    sc_out<bool> found; // Output port for the boolean value indicating whether the target value was found

    SC_CTOR(BinarySearch) {
        // Process to perform binary search
        SC_METHOD(binarySearch);
        sensitive << target << v_size << v;
    }

    void binarySearch() {
        int low = 0;
        int high = v_size.read() - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
            if (v[mid].read() == target.read()) {
                found.write(true);
                break;
            }
            if (v[mid].read() > target.read()) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        found.write(false);
    }
};
```
The SystemC code uses the same algorithm as the C++/C code to perform binary search. It takes the target value and the size of the vector as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the target value was found in the vector.

The SystemC code declares input and output ports for the target value, the size of the vector, and the vector itself. It also declares a process that performs the binary search and writes the result to the `found` output port.

The process starts by defining the upper and lower bounds of the vector to be searched: `low = 0` and `high = v_size.read() - 1`.

It then enters a `while` loop that continues until the element is found or the vector cannot be divided into more parts.

Inside the loop, the middle element of the vector is calculated: `mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low`.

The process then checks if the middle element is equal to the target value. If it is, the process writes `true` to the `found` output port and breaks out of the loop.

If the middle element is greater than the target value, the process sets `high` to `mid - 1` and continues searching the left half of the vector. If the middle element is less than the target value, the process sets `low` to `mid + 1` and continues searching the right half of the vector.

If the loop ends without finding the target value, the process writes `false` to the `found` output port.
