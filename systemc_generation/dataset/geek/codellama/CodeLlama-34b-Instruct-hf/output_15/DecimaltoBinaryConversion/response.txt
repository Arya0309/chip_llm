  **Inputs:**

* `dec_in`: An integer input that represents the decimal number to be converted.

**Outputs:**

* `binary_out`: An integer output that represents the binary number equivalent to the decimal input.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code is a program that converts a decimal number to a binary number. The program consists of a `decToBinary` function and a `main` function.

The `decToBinary` function takes an integer `n` as input and converts it to binary. The function uses a `binaryNum` array to store the binary representation of `n`. The function then uses a loop to divide `n` by 2 and store the remainder in the `binaryNum` array. Once the loop is finished, the function prints the binary number in reverse order (i.e., starting from the least significant bit).

The `main` function is the driver code that calls the `decToBinary` function with the input `n` and prints the binary output.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that converts a decimal number to binary
SC_MODULE(DecToBinary) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in; // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for the binary number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DecToBinary) {
        // Process to convert decimal to binary
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    // Method to convert the decimal number
    void convert() {
        // Get the decimal input
        int n = dec_in.read();

        // Array to store the binary number
        int binaryNum[32];

        // Counter for the binary array
        int i = 0;

        // Perform division and modulo operations
        while (n > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }

        // Print the binary number in reverse order
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
        }
    }
};
```
The SystemC code implements the same logic as the C++/C code. The `DecToBinary` module has an input port `dec_in` for the decimal number and an output port `binary_out` for the binary number. The module also contains a `convert` method that performs the conversion from decimal to binary. The method uses a `binaryNum` array to store the binary representation of the input decimal number. Once the conversion is done, the method prints the binary number in reverse order to the `binary_out` port.

The `SC_METHOD` macro is used to specify the process that performs the conversion. The process is sensitive to changes in the `dec_in` input port, which means that the process will be triggered whenever the input value changes.
