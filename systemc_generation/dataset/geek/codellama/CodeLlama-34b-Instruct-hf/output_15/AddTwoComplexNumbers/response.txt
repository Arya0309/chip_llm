  **Inputs:**

* `real1`, `imag1` - real and imaginary parts of the first complex number
* `real2`, `imag2` - real and imaginary parts of the second complex number

**Outputs:**

* `real_sum`, `imag_sum` - real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code defines a `Complex` class that represents a complex number with real and imaginary parts. The code defines a method `addComp()` that takes two `Complex` objects as inputs and returns their sum as a new `Complex` object. The code also declares two instances of the `Complex` class and calls the `addComp()` method to calculate the sum of the two complex numbers.

The `addComp()` method first creates a temporary `Complex` object called `temp`. Then, it adds the real parts of the two complex numbers and assigns the result to `temp.real`. Next, it adds the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers and assigns the result to `temp.imaginary`. Finally, it returns `temp`, which is the sum of the two complex numbers.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;
    sc_in<int> imag1;
    sc_in<int> real2;
    sc_in<int> imag2;
    sc_out<int> real_sum;
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;

    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        addComp();
    }

    void addComp() {
        Complex C1(real1.read(), imag1.read());
        Complex C2(real2.read(), imag2.read());
        Complex C3 = C1.addComp(C2);
        real_sum.write(C3.real);
        imag_sum.write(C3.imaginary);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a `ComplexAdder` module that takes `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, `real_sum`, and `imag_sum` as inputs and outputs. The `addComp()` method is defined as a process that is triggered by the sensitivity list `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`.

The `addComp()` method first reads the inputs and initializes two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` with the real and imaginary parts of the two input complex numbers. Then, it calls the `addComp()` method of `C1` to calculate the sum of `C1` and `C2`. Finally, it writes the real and imaginary parts of the sum to `real_sum` and `imag_sum`, respectively.

Note that the SystemC code uses the same variable and class names as the C++/C code, except for the `addComp()` method, which is renamed to `addComp_sysc()` in the SystemC code to avoid name conflicts. Additionally, the SystemC code uses the `sc_in` and `sc_out` classes from the SystemC library to define the input and output ports, rather than the C++/C library's `cin` and `cout`.
