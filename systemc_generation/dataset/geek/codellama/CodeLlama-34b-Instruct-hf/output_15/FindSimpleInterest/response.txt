  **Inputs:**

* P: Principal amount of the loan or investment
* R: Rate of interest
* T: Time period of the loan or investment

**Outputs:**

* SI: Simple Interest

**C++/C Code Explanation:**

1. The code starts with a comment that describes the purpose of the program, which is to calculate the simple interest for a given principal amount, time period, and rate of interest.
2. The next line includes the necessary header files for the program to run, specifically the `iostream` header file.
3. The `using namespace std;` line specifies that the program will be using the standard namespace.
4. The `main()` function is defined, which is the entry point for the program.
5. Inside the `main()` function, three variables are declared: `P`, `R`, and `T`, which correspond to the inputs mentioned earlier. Their values are set to 1 for demonstration purposes.
6. The next line calculates the simple interest using the formula: `SI = (P * T * R) / 100`.
7. Finally, the result of the calculation is printed to the console using `cout`.

**SystemC Code:**

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic of the C++/C code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SimpleInterest) {
    sc_in<float> P;  // Input port for principal amount
    sc_in<float> R;  // Input port for rate of interest
    sc_in<float> T;  // Input port for time period
    sc_out<float> SI; // Output port for simple interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SimpleInterest) {
        // Process to perform simple interest calculation
        SC_METHOD(calculate);
        sensitive << P << R << T;
    }

    // Method to calculate simple interest
    void calculate() {
        SI.write((P.read() * T.read() * R.read()) / 100);
    }
};
```
In this code, we have defined a new `SimpleInterest` module that represents the simple interest calculation formula. The module has three input ports (`P`, `R`, and `T`) and one output port (`SI`). The constructor defines a new process that performs the simple interest calculation, which is triggered whenever any of the input ports change their values. The `calculate()` method performs the actual calculation and writes the result to the `SI` output port.

Note that we have used the same names for the input and output ports as the original C++/C code, which makes it easier to connect the SystemC code with the existing testbench.
