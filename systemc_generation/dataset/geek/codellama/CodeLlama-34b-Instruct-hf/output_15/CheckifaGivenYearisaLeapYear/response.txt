  **Inputs:**

* `year`: An integer representing the year to be checked for leap year status.

**Outputs:**

* `is_leap_year`: A boolean representing whether the input year is a leap year or not.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code defines a function called `checkYear` that takes an integer `year` as input and returns a boolean `is_leap_year`. The function checks whether the input year is a leap year or not based on the following rules:

* If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
* If the year is not divisible by 100, it is not a leap year.
* If the year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
* If the year is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year.

The code then uses the `main` function to drive the `checkYear` function, passing in the input year of 2000 and outputting the result to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LeapYear) {
    sc_in<int> year; // Input port for the year to be checked
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year; // Output port for leap year status

    SC_CTOR(LeapYear) {
        SC_METHOD(checkYear);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    void checkYear() {
        if (year.read() % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year.read() % 100 == 0 && year.read() % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year.read() % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};

SC_MODULE(Driver) {
    sc_in<bool> is_leap_year; // Input port for leap year status

    SC_CTOR(Driver) {
        SC_THREAD(run);
    }

    void run() {
        cout << "Leap year: " << is_leap_year.read() << endl;
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    LeapYear leapYear("leapYear");
    Driver driver("driver");

    sc_signal<int> year;
    sc_signal<bool> is_leap_year;

    year.write(2000);

    leapYear.year(year);
    driver.is_leap_year(is_leap_year);

    sc_start();

    return 0;
}
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `LeapYear` that takes an input port `year` and an output port `is_leap_year`. The module checks the input year for leap year status and writes the result to the output port.

We also define a module called `Driver` that takes an input port `is_leap_year` and writes the result to the console.

In the `sc_main` function, we create instances of the `LeapYear` and `Driver` modules and connect their input and output ports to the appropriate signals. We also set the input port `year` to 2000 and start the simulation.
