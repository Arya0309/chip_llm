  C++/C Code:

The provided code is a C++ program that takes an integer matrix as input, swaps the element of the first and last rows, and then displays the modified matrix on the console. The input matrix is defined in the main() function and is of fixed size 4x4. The interchangeFirstLast() function is called with the matrix as an argument, and it swaps the elements of the first and last rows. Finally, the swapped matrix is printed on the console in the main() function.

**SystemC Code:**

The following SystemC code has an equivalent functionality as the provided C++/C code. The SystemC code swaps the element of the first and last rows of the input matrix and then outputs the result on the "out" port.
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SwapRows) {
  sc_in<int> in[SIZE];
  sc_out<int> out[SIZE];

  SC_CTOR(SwapRows) {
    SC_METHOD(swap_rows);
    sensitive << in;
  }

  void swap_rows() {
    int rows = SIZE;
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
      int t = in[0].read();
      in[0].write(in[rows - 1].read());
      in[rows - 1].write(t);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
      out[i].write(in[i].read());
    }
  }
};
```
**Explanation:**

The SystemC code is a Module that takes in an integer matrix of size 4x4 as input (`in` port) and outputs the same matrix with the first and last rows swapped (`out` port). The `swap_rows` method performs the actual swap operation by reading the elements from the `in` port, swapping the first and last rows, and then writing the swapped elements back to the `out` port.

The `out` port is an array of 4 `sc_out<int>` objects, each representing one row of the output matrix. Similarly, the `in` port is an array of 4 `sc_in<int>` objects, each representing one row of the input matrix.

The `sensitive` statement in the constructor specifies that the `swap_rows` method should be called whenever the `in` port changes. This ensures that the swapping operation is performed immediately when the input matrix is available.

**Integration with Testbench:**

To integrate the SystemC code with the provided testbench, you can substitute the `in` and `out` arrays with the appropriate signals from the testbench. This can be done by replacing the `in` and `out` arrays with the `in` and `out` signals from the testbench.

Here's an example of how the SystemC code can be integrated with the provided testbench:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Define the input and output signals
sc_in<int> in[SIZE];
sc_out<int> out[SIZE];

// Instantiate the SystemC module
SwapRows swapRows("swapRows");

// Connect the signals to the module's ports
swapRows.in.bind(in);
swapRows.out.bind(out);

// Define the testbench
void test() {
  int m[SIZE][SIZE];
  // Initialize the input matrix
  m = {{8, 9, 7, 6},
       {4, 7, 6, 5},
       {3, 2, 1, 8},
       {9, 9, 7, 7}};
  // Assign the input matrix to the in port
  in.assign(m);
  // Wait for the swap operation to complete
  out.wait();
  // Display the output matrix
  for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
      cout << out[i][j] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
}

// Run the testbench
int main() {
  test();
  return 0;
}
```
In the above example, the `in` and `out` signals are defined and then bound to the `in` and `out` ports of the `SwapRows` module. The `test` function initializes the input matrix and assigns it to the `in` port, and then waits for the swap operation to complete by calling the `wait` method on the `out` port. Finally, the output matrix is retrieved from the `out` port and displayed on the console using the `cout` statement.
