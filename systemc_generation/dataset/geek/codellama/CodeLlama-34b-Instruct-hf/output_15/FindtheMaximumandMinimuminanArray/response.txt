  **Inputs:**

* `arr`: An array of integers
* `n`: The size of the array

**Outputs:**

* `min_val`: The minimum element in the array
* `max_val`: The maximum element in the array

**Summary of C++/C Code:**

The code defines two functions, `getMin()` and `getMax()`, which take in an array of integers `arr` and its size `n`, and return the minimum and maximum elements in the array, respectively. The `main()` function is used to test the two functions. It initializes an integer array `arr[]` and sets its size `n` to the number of elements in the array. The `main()` function then prints the minimum and maximum elements of the array using the `getMin()` and `getMax()` functions.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MinMaxFinder) {
    sc_in<int> data_in[8];  // Input port for the data
    sc_in<bool> start;  // Input port that triggers the computation
    sc_out<bool> done;  // Output port that signals when the computation is done
    sc_out<int> min_val;  // Output port for the minimum value
    sc_out<int> max_val;  // Output port for the maximum value

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MinMaxFinder) {
        // Process to find the minimum and maximum values
        SC_METHOD(findMinMax);
        sensitive << start;
    }

    // Method to find the minimum and maximum values
    void findMinMax() {
        int min = INT_MAX;
        int max = INT_MIN;
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
            if (data_in[i] < min) {
                min = data_in[i];
            }
            if (data_in[i] > max) {
                max = data_in[i];
            }
        }
        done.write(true);
        min_val.write(min);
        max_val.write(max);
    }
};
```
**Explanation of SystemC Code:**

The SystemC code defines a `MinMaxFinder` module that takes in an array of 8 integers `data_in`, an input port `start` that triggers the computation, an output port `done` that signals when the computation is done, and output ports `min_val` and `max_val` that output the minimum and maximum values, respectively.

The constructor initializes the `findMinMax()` method, which finds the minimum and maximum values in the input array and writes them to the output ports `min_val` and `max_val`, respectively. The `findMinMax()` method triggers when the input port `start` is asserted. The method uses a for loop to iterate over the input array and compare each element to the current minimum and maximum values. When a new minimum or maximum is found, the corresponding output port is updated. Once the minimum and maximum values are found, the `done` output port is asserted to indicate that the computation is complete.

**Comparison between C++/C and SystemC Code:**

Both the C++/C code and the SystemC code find the minimum and maximum elements in an array of integers. However, the C++/C code uses the standard library functions `min_element()` and `max_element()` to perform the computation, while the SystemC code implements the computation using a for loop and explicit comparisons.

While the C++/C code is more concise and readable, the SystemC code provides more control over the computation and allows for the output ports to be asserted at specific points in time. Additionally, the SystemC code can be easily integrated with other SystemC modules and a high-level synthesis flow.
