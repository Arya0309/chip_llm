  **Inputs:**

* `mat[][MAX]` - a 2D array of integers representing a matrix
* `n` - the size of the matrix (number of rows and columns)

**Outputs:**

* `principal` - the sum of the principal diagonal (elements on the diagonal from top left to bottom right)
* `secondary` - the sum of the secondary diagonal (elements on the diagonal from bottom left to top right)

**Explanation:**

The provided C++/C code is a simple program to find the sum of the diagonals of a given matrix. It does this by iterating over the elements of the matrix and adding up the elements that fall on the principal diagonal and the secondary diagonal.

The program starts by defining a function `printDiagonalSums` which takes two arguments: an integer matrix `mat` and an integer `n` representing the size of the matrix. It then declares two integer variables `principal` and `secondary` to store the sums of the diagonals.

The program then enters a nested `for` loop that iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix. Within the loop, it checks if the current element is on the principal diagonal by checking if the row index `i` is equal to the column index `j`. If the current element is on the principal diagonal, it adds the element to the `principal` sum.

Similarly, the program checks if the current element is on the secondary diagonal by checking if the sum of the row index `i` and the column index `j` is equal to `n - 1`. If the current element is on the secondary diagonal, it adds the element to the `secondary` sum.

After the loop completes, the program prints out the `principal` and `secondary` sums. Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

To convert this code to SystemC, we need to define a module that takes the same inputs and produces the same outputs. We can define a module called `DiagonalSums` that has three ports:

* `mat[][MAX]` - an array of integer signals representing the matrix
* `n` - an integer signal representing the size of the matrix
* `principal` - an integer signal representing the sum of the principal diagonal
* `secondary` - an integer signal representing the sum of the secondary diagonal

The `DiagonalSums` module can be implemented as a SystemC module as follows:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSums) {
    sc_in<int> mat[][MAX];
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<int> principal;
    sc_out<int> secondary;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSums) {
        // Process to calculate the diagonal sums
        SC_METHOD(calculateDiagonalSums);
        sensitive << mat[[MAX]][MAX] << n;
    }

    // Method to calculate the diagonal sums
    void calculateDiagonalSums() {
        int principal = 0, secondary = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // Check if the current element is on the principal diagonal
                if (i == j) {
                    principal += mat[i][j];
                }
                // Check if the current element is on the secondary diagonal
                if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) {
                    secondary += mat[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        principal.write(principal);
        secondary.write(secondary);
    }
};
```
This SystemC module has the same functionality as the original C++/C code: it takes a matrix and its size as inputs, and produces the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals as outputs. The module consists of a single method `calculateDiagonalSums` that calculates the diagonal sums using the nested `for` loop. The method is sensitive to changes in the `mat[][MAX]` array and the `n` signal, and it updates the `principal` and `secondary` signals accordingly.
