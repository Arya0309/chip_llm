  **Inputs:**

* a: The first integer to compare.
* b: The second integer to compare.
* c: The third integer to compare.

**Outputs:**

* largest: The largest of the three input integers.

**Line-by-line summary:**

* `#include <iostream>`: Includes the input/output library, which will be used to display the largest number.
* `using namespace std;`: Uses the standard library namespace, which makes the code more concise.
* `int main()`: Begins the definition of the main() function, which is the entry point of the program.
* `int a = 1, b = 2, c = 11;`: Declares three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c` and initializes them to 1, 2, and 11, respectively.
* `if (a >= b)`: Checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
* `if (a >= c)`: Checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `c`.
* `cout << a;`: If `a` is the largest number, displays its value using the `cout` function.
* `else`: If `a` is not the largest number, goes to the next condition.
* `if (b >= c)`: Checks if `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
* `cout << b;`: If `b` is the largest number, displays its value using the `cout` function.
* `else`: If `b` is not the largest number, goes to the next condition.
* `cout << c;`: If `c` is the largest number, displays its value using the `cout` function.
* `return 0;`: Ends the main() function and returns the value 0 to the operating system.

**SystemC Code Snippet:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LargestNumber) {
  sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
  sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
  sc_in<int> c;  // Input port for the third number
  sc_out<int> largest;  // Output port for the largest number

  // Constructor
  SC_CTOR(LargestNumber) {
    // Process to find the largest number
    SC_METHOD(find_largest);
    sensitive << a << b << c;
  }

  // Method to find the largest number
  void find_largest() {
    if (a >= b && a >= c) {
      largest.write(a);
    } else if (b >= c) {
      largest.write(b);
    } else {
      largest.write(c);
    }
  }
};
```
In this SystemC code snippet, we define a module called `LargestNumber` that has three input ports (a, b, and c) and one output port (largest). We also define a process called `find_largest` that compares the input values and writes the largest one to the `largest` output port. The `find_largest` process is sensitive to changes in any of the input ports.

Note that we have replaced the `cout` statement in the C++/C code with the `largest.write` statement in the SystemC code, which writes the largest number to the `largest` output port. This ensures that the SystemC code can be used in a high-level synthesis flow, where the output is typically written to a register or memory location, rather than displayed on the console.
