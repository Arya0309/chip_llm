  **Inputs and Outputs:**

* The input to the code is a two-dimensional array of integers, `mat`, with size `n x n`.
* The output of the code is the sum of the elements on the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix.
* The function `printDiagonalSums` takes the matrix and its size as input and prints the sum of the elements on the principal and secondary diagonals.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. Line 1-2: Include header files and define constants.
2. Line 4-5: Declare variables `principal` and `secondary` and initialize them to 0.
3. Line 7-12: Loop through each element of the matrix using nested for-loops.
4. Line 9-11: Check if the element is on the principal diagonal (i.e., i == j). If yes, add the element to the sum of the principal diagonal.
5. Line 11-12: Check if the element is on the secondary diagonal (i.e., i + j == n - 1). If yes, add the element to the sum of the secondary diagonal.
6. Line 14-17: Print the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals.
7. Line 19-23: Provide a driver code to test the function.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that finds the sum of diagonals of a matrix 
SC_MODULE(DiagonalSum) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];  // Matrix input port
    sc_in<int> n;      // Size of the matrix
    sc_out<int> principal;   // Sum of the principal diagonal
    sc_out<int> secondary;   // Sum of the secondary diagonal

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSum) {
        // Process to find the sums of the diagonals
        SC_METHOD(findDiagonalSums);
        sensitive << matrix << n;
    }

    // Method to find the sums of the diagonals
    void findDiagonalSums() {
        int principalSum = 0;
        int secondarySum = 0;

        // Loop through each element of the matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // Check if element is on the principal diagonal
                if (i == j) {
                    principalSum += matrix[i][j];
                }

                // Check if element is on the secondary diagonal
                if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) {
                    secondarySum += matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
        }

        // Write the sums to the output ports
        principal.write(principalSum);
        secondary.write(secondarySum);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `DiagonalSum` that takes a matrix input port `matrix` and an integer input port `n`. The module has two output ports `principal` and `secondary` for the sum of the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively. In the module constructor, we define a process `findDiagonalSums` that finds the sums of the diagonals when the input matrix or size changes. The process loops through each element of the matrix and checks if the element is on the principal or secondary diagonal. If yes, it adds the element to the corresponding sum. Finally, the sums are written to the output ports.

Note that the code utilizes the signals provided in the problem statement, which are the matrix, size, principal diagonal sum, and secondary diagonal sum. This ensures that the SystemC code can be integrated with the existing testbench.
