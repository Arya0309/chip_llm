  **Inputs:**

* An array of integers named `arr`
* An integer named `n` representing the size of the array

**Outputs:**

* A sorted version of the input array `arr`

**Code Analysis:**

The code is a C++ implementation of the selection sort algorithm. The algorithm divides the input array into two parts: the sorted and unsorted parts. The algorithm iterates over the unsorted part and finds the smallest element, swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part, and moves the unsorted part boundary by one position. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

The selection sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is not recommended for large datasets. However, it is simple to understand and implement, and it is often used as a learning tool for beginners.

**SystemC Implementation:**

The following SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the C++ code and incorporates the signals defined above. The code defines a module called `selection_sort` that takes an array of integers as input and outputs a sorted version of the array. The `selection_sort` module has three input signals: `clk`, `start`, and `n`, which correspond to the clock signal, the start signal, and the size of the input array, respectively. The module also has an output signal called `done`, which is asserted when the sorting process is complete.

Here is the SystemC code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(selection_sort) {
    // Input ports
    sc_in<bool> clk;
    sc_in<bool> start;
    sc_in<int> n;

    // Output ports
    sc_out<bool> done;

    // Method to perform the sorting
    void sort() {
        while (true) {
            wait(start.read());
            for (int i = 0; i < n.read(); i++) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < n.read(); j++) {
                    if (arr[j] < arr[i]) {
                        swap(arr[i], arr[j]);
                    }
                }
            }
            done.write(true);
        }
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    sc_trace_file *tf = sc_create_vcd_trace_file("selection_sort");
    sc_clock clk("clk", 10, SC_NS, 0.5, 0, SC_NS, true);

    selection_sort sort("selection_sort");
    sc_signal<int> arr;
    sc_signal<int> n;
    sc_signal<bool> start;
    sc_signal<bool> done;

    sort(arr, n, start, done);

    sc_start(100, SC_NS);

    tf = sc_close_vcd_trace_file(tf);
    return 0;
}
```
In this code, we define a module called `selection_sort` that takes four input signals: `clk`, `start`, `n`, and `arr`. The module also has an output signal called `done`, which is asserted when the sorting process is complete.

The `sort` method of the `selection_sort` module performs the selection sort algorithm on the input array `arr`. The method uses a for loop to iterate over the unsorted part of the array and a nested for loop to find the smallest element in the unsorted part. When the smallest element is found, the method swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part and moves the unsorted part boundary by one position. The process continues until the entire array is sorted.

In the `sc_main` function, we create a trace file and a clock signal. We also define an array `arr` and an integer `n` that represent the input array and its size, respectively. We also define a start signal and a done signal that are used to control the sorting process.

We create an instance of the `selection_sort` module and call its constructor with the input signals and the output signal. We then start the simulation and wait for the sorting process to complete. Finally, we close the trace file and return 0 to indicate that the simulation was successful.
