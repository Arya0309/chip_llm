  **SystemC Equivalent**

The following SystemC code is a faithful implementation of the C++/C code provided:
```
#include <iostream>

SC_MODULE(SumFinder) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> n; // Input port for 'n'
    sc_out<unsigned int> result; // Output port for 'result'

    // Function to find sum of first 'n' natural numbers
    int findSum(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        return sum;
    }

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SumFinder) {
        // Process to compute the sum
        SC_METHOD(computeSum);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to compute the sum
    void computeSum() {
        result.write(findSum(n.read()));
    }
};
```
**Code Explanation**

The SystemC code above implements the same logic as the C++/C code. It declares two input signals, `n` and `result`, and one output signal, `result`. The `n` signal is used to pass the integer value to be summed, and the `result` signal is used to output the sum.

The `findSum` function is implemented as a SystemC process that takes an integer `n` as input and returns its sum. The function uses a `for` loop to calculate the sum, and the loop condition is `i <= n`. The `sum` variable is used to store the running sum and is initialized to 0. Inside the loop, the `sum` variable is incremented by `i`.

The `SumFinder` module is the top-level SystemC module that implements the interface and behavior of the original C++/C code. It declares the `n` and `result` signals as input and output ports, respectively, and instantiates the `findSum` process. The `computeSum` method is the entry point for the `findSum` process, and it is triggered by the value change on the `n` input signal. The `result` output signal is associated with the return value of the `findSum` function.

**Inputs**:

* `n`: The integer value to be summed

**Outputs**:

* `result`: The sum of the first `n` natural numbers

**Additional Information**:

* The SystemC code uses the `sc_in` and `sc_out` types for declaring input and output signals, respectively.
* The `sc_in<int> n` declaration creates an input signal named `n` of type `int`.
* The `sc_out<int> result` declaration creates an output signal named `result` of type `int`.
* The `sc_ctor` macro is used to declare the constructor for the `SumFinder` module and instantiate the `findSum` process.
* The `SC_METHOD` macro is used to define the behavior of the `findSum` process as a method of the `SumFinder` module.
* The `sensitive` keyword is used to specify that the `computeSum` method should be triggered by the value change on the `n` input signal.
* The `result.write` statement is used to assign the value of the `result` output signal.
* The `findSum` function is implemented as a separate process to ensure that it can be synthesized independently and reused in other parts of the design.
