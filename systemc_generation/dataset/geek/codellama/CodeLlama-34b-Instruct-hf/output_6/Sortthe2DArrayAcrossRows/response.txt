  **Inputs:**

* `m[][]` - a 2-dimensional integer array representing the input matrix
* `r` - the number of rows in the input matrix
* `c` - the number of columns in the input matrix

**Outputs:**

* The sorted 2D matrix row-wise

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code implements the sortRowWise function that sorts a 2D matrix row-wise. The function first loops through each row of the matrix, then through each column of the row, and finally, through the comparison and swapping loops for each element in the column. The swapping process is done using the swap function, which simply swaps the elements of two indices.

After sorting the matrix, the function prints the sorted matrix.

The main function creates a 4x4 integer matrix called `m` and initializes it with the values provided in the code. It then calls the sortRowWise function with the `m`, `r`, and `c` as arguments.

In order to convert this code to SystemC, we need to identify the main inputs and outputs, as well as the signal ports that we need to use to interface with the existing testbench.

The main inputs are the `m[][]`, `r`, and `c` variables, which represent the input matrix, the number of rows, and the number of columns, respectively. The main output is the sorted 2D matrix row-wise.

We need to use the `clk` signal to clock the SystemC module, and the `start` signal to start the sorting process. We also need to use the `done` signal to indicate when the sorting process is complete.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that sorts a 2D matrix row-wise
SC_MODULE(Sort) {
    // Input ports
    sc_in<int, 2> m; // 2D input matrix
    sc_in<int> r; // Number of rows in the input matrix
    sc_in<int> c; // Number of columns in the input matrix
    
    // Output ports
    sc_out<int, 2> sorted_matrix; // Output matrix
    sc_out<bool> done; // Indicates when the sorting process is complete

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Sort) {
        // Process to sort the input matrix
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << m << r << c;
    }

    // Method to sort the input matrix
    void sort() {
        // Initialize the sorted matrix to zero
        sorted_matrix.write(0);

        // Iterate through each row of the input matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            // Iterate through each column of the row
            for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                // Iterate through each element of the column
                for (int k = 0; k < c - j - 1; k++) {
                    // Swap the elements if they are out of order
                    if (m.read(i, j) > m.read(i, k + 1)) {
                        m.write(i, j, m.read(i, k + 1));
                        m.write(i, k + 1, m.read(i, j));
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Set the sorted matrix as the output
        sorted_matrix.write(m);

        // Indicate that the sorting process is complete
        done.write(true);
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we define an `SC_MODULE` called `Sort` that implements the sortRowWise function. The module has the following input and output ports:

* `m` - an 2D input matrix with dimensions `r x c`
* `r` - number of rows in the input matrix
* `c` - number of columns in the input matrix
* `sorted_matrix` - output 2D matrix with dimensions `r x c`
* `done` - indicates when the sorting process is complete

The `sort` method is triggered by the `clk` signal, and it sorts the input matrix using the same algorithm as the original C++/C code. After the sorting process is complete, it sets the `sorted_matrix` output port with the sorted 2D matrix, and sets the `done` signal to indicate that the sorting process is complete.

Note that in the SystemC code, we use the `sc_in<int, 2>` and `sc_out<int, 2>` types to represent the 2D input and output matrices. These types are used to define the input and output ports of the `Sort` module, and they allow us to read and write the 2D matrices.
