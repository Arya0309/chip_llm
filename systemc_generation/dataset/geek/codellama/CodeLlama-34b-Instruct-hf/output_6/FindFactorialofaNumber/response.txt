  **Factorial of a Number**

Input:

* `num`: An `unsigned int` variable representing the number whose factorial is to be calculated.

Output:

* The factorial of `num`, calculated using the function `factorial(num)`.

The code provides a function named `factorial(num)` that calculates the factorial of `num`. The function takes an `unsigned int` variable as input and returns the factorial of that number. The function uses a for loop to iterate from 2 to `num` and multiply the result with each number in the range. The final result is returned.

The driver code declares a variable `num` and assigns it the value of 5. The factorial of `num` is calculated using the function `factorial(num)` and printed to the console along with a message indicating the factorial of `num` is being calculated.

In SystemC, we can represent the same logic as follows:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> num;  // Input port for the number whose factorial is to be calculated
    sc_out<unsigned int> result;  // Output port for the factorial of the number

    void factorial() {
        unsigned int res = 1;
        for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= num; i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        result.write(res);
    }

    SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
        SC_METHOD(factorial);
        sensitive << num;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module named `Factorial` that takes an input port `num` of type `unsigned int` and an output port `result` of type `unsigned int`. The module has a single method named `factorial` that calculates the factorial of `num` using a for loop and stores the result in `result`. The `factorial` method is triggered by the `num` input port, so whenever the value of `num` changes, the `factorial` method is executed.

Note that we have used the same variable names and function names as in the original C++/C code to make the SystemC code more readable and understandable.
