  **Inputs:**

* `real1`: Real part of the first complex number
* `imag1`: Imaginary part of the first complex number
* `real2`: Real part of the second complex number
* `imag2`: Imaginary part of the second complex number

**Outputs:**

* `real_sum`: Real part of the sum of the two complex numbers
* `imag_sum`: Imaginary part of the sum of the two complex numbers

**Analysis:**
The provided C++/C code defines a `Complex` class that represents a complex number with real and imaginary parts. The class has a constructor that initializes the real and imaginary parts, and a method `addComp()` that adds two complex numbers by taking real and imaginary parts of each number separately and then returns a new complex number with the sum of real and imaginary parts. The driver code creates two complex numbers `C1` and `C2`, and then calls `addComp()` method to add them. The sum is stored in `C3` and the real and imaginary parts of the sum are printed to the console.

**Translation to SystemC:**
Here is the equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic of the original C++/C code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that represents a complex number
SC_MODULE(Complex) {
    sc_in<int> real_in;  // Input port for the real part
    sc_in<int> imag_in;  // Input port for the imaginary part
    sc_out<int> real_out; // Output port for the real part
    sc_out<int> imag_out; // Output port for the imaginary part

    // Process to perform addition
    SC_METHOD(addComp);
    sensitive << real_in << imag_in;

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void addComp() {
        // Creating temporary variable
        int real_temp = real_in.read() + real_in.read();
        int imag_temp = imag_in.read() + imag_in.read();

        // Write the real and imaginary parts of the sum to the output ports
        real_out.write(real_temp);
        imag_out.write(imag_temp);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // Create two complex numbers
    Complex C1(3, 2);
    Complex C2(9, 5);

    // Print the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers
    std::cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real_out.read() << " + i" << C1.imag_out.read() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real_out.read() << " + i" << C2.imag_out.read() << std::endl;

    // Create a module to add the two complex numbers
    Complex C3;

    // Call the addComp() method
    C3.addComp(C1.real_out.read(), C1.imag_out.read(), C2.real_out.read(), C2.imag_out.read());

    // Print the real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers
    std::cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real_out.read() << " + i" << C3.imag_out.read() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
In the above code, we have defined a `Complex` module that represents a complex number with real and imaginary parts. The `addComp()` method takes real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers as inputs and returns the sum of the two complex numbers. The `sc_main()` function creates two complex numbers `C1` and `C2`, and then calls `addComp()` method to add them. The real and imaginary parts of the sum are stored in `C3`, and are printed to the console.

Note that we have used the provided signals `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, `real_sum`, and `imag_sum` to represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers and the sum of the two complex numbers.
