  C++/C Code:

The provided C++/C code is a simple program that converts an octal number to its decimal equivalent. The code has the following input and output:

* Input:
	+ `n`: An octal number (8-bit integer)
* Output:
	+ `decimal_output`: The decimal equivalent of the input octal number (32-bit integer)

The code has the following functionality:

1. The function `octalToDecimal` takes an octal number `n` as input and returns its decimal equivalent.
2. The function first initializes a variable `num` to the input value `n`.
3. It then initializes a variable `dec_value` to 0, which will store the decimal equivalent of `n`.
4. A variable `base` is initialized to 1, which represents the base value for the octal number.
5. A temporary variable `temp` is assigned the value of `n`.
6. While `temp` is non-zero, the code extracts the last digit of `temp` using the modulo operator `% 10`.
7. The extracted digit is then multiplied by the current base value `base` and added to `dec_value`.
8. The base value is updated to `base * 8`.
9. The process is repeated until `temp` is equal to 0.
10. The final `dec_value` is returned as the decimal equivalent of the input octal number.

SystemC Code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that converts octal to decimal
SC_MODULE(OctalToDecimal) {
    sc_in<int> octal_input;  // Input port for the octal number
    sc_out<int> decimal_output;  // Output port for the decimal equivalent

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(OctalToDecimal) {
        // Process to perform conversion
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << octal_input;
    }

    // Method to convert octal to decimal
    void convert() {
        int num = octal_input.read();
        int dec_value = 0;
        int base = 1;

        int temp = num;
        while (temp) {
            int last_digit = temp % 10;
            temp = temp / 10;
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base *= 8;
        }

        decimal_output.write(dec_value);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `OctalToDecimal` that has two ports: `octal_input` and `decimal_output`. The input port `octal_input` is an 8-bit integer that receives the input octal number, and the output port `decimal_output` is a 32-bit integer that sends the decimal equivalent of the input octal number.

The `convert` method takes the input octal number from `octal_input` and performs the conversion to decimal using the same logic as the C++/C function. The resulting decimal equivalent is then written to `decimal_output`.

Note that the `octal_input` and `decimal_output` signals are used in the SystemC code to ensure that it integrates seamlessly with our existing testbench.
