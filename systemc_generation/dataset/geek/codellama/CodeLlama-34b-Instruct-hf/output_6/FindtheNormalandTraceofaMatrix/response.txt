  **Inputs:**

* `matrix`: a two-dimensional array of integers representing the given matrix of size `MAX x MAX`.
* `n`: an integer representing the size of the matrix.

**Outputs:**

* `trace`: an integer representing the trace of the matrix.
* `norm`: an integer representing the normal of the matrix.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code is a simple program that calculates the trace and normal of a given matrix. The code first defines the input and output signals, and then defines two functions, `findNormal()` and `findTrace()`, which calculate the normal and trace of the matrix, respectively. The `main()` function is the driver code that calls the `findNormal()` and `findTrace()` functions with the input matrix and its size, and then prints the trace and normal of the matrix to the console.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`: This line includes the C++ standard library, which provides the necessary functions for input and output, mathematics, and other standard C++ functionality.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line specifies that the program should use the standard namespace, which makes it easier to type and read.
3. `const int MAX = 100;`: This line defines a constant integer variable `MAX` with the value 100, which will be used as the maximum size of the matrix.
4. `int findNormal(int mat[][MAX], int n)`: This line defines a function named `findNormal` that takes a two-dimensional array of integers named `mat` and an integer named `n` as inputs. The function returns an integer representing the normal of the matrix.
5. `int findTrace(int mat[][MAX], int n)`: This line defines a function named `findTrace` that takes a two-dimensional array of integers named `mat` and an integer named `n` as inputs. The function returns an integer representing the trace of the matrix.
6. `int main()`: This line defines the main function of the program.
7. `int mat[][MAX] = {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}, {3, 3, 3, 3, 3}, {4, 4, 4, 4, 4}, {5, 5, 5, 5, 5}};`: This line defines a constant matrix of size 5 x 5 named `mat`.
8. `cout << "Trace of Matrix = " << findTrace(mat, 5) << endl;`: This line calculates the trace of the matrix using the `findTrace()` function and prints it to the console.
9. `cout << "Normal of Matrix = " << findNormal(mat, 5) << endl;`: This line calculates the normal of the matrix using the `findNormal()` function and prints it to the console.
10. `return 0;`: This line returns 0, which indicates that the program executed successfully.

**SystemC Code:**

Here is a SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the provided C++/C code and utilizes the `matrix`, `trace`, and `norm` signals defined above:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Matrix) {
  sc_in<int> matrix[100][100];
  sc_out<int> trace;
  sc_out<int> norm;

  void normal() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < 100; j++) {
        sum += matrix[i][j] * matrix[i][j];
      }
    }
    sc_out<int> norm.write(sum);
  }
  
  void trace() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      sum += matrix[i][i];
    }
    sc_out<int> trace.write(sum);
  }

  // Constructor
  SC_CTOR(Matrix) {
    SC_METHOD(normal);
    sensitive << matrix;
    SC_METHOD(trace);
    sensitive << matrix;
  }
};
```
In this code, we define a SystemC module named `Matrix` that takes a two-dimensional array of integers named `matrix` and two output signals, `trace` and `norm`, as inputs. The module defines two methods, `normal()` and `trace()`, which calculate the normal and trace of the matrix, respectively. The `normal()` method calculates the sum of the products of the elements on the principal diagonal of the matrix, while the `trace()` method calculates the sum of the elements on the principal diagonal of the matrix. The results are written to the `norm` and `trace` signals, respectively.

In the constructor of the `Matrix` module, we define two methods, `normal()` and `trace()`, which are sensitive to the `matrix` signal. This means that when the value of any element in the `matrix` signal changes, the corresponding method will be called automatically. The `normal()` method is called when the value of any element on the principal diagonal of the matrix changes, while the `trace()` method is called when the value of any element on the principal diagonal of the matrix changes.

Note that the `Matrix` module is parameterized by the maximum size of the matrix (100 x 100 in this case), so it can be easily scaled up or down depending on the application.
