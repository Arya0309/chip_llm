  **Inputs:**

* `dec_in`: The decimal number to be converted to binary.

**Outputs:**

* `binary_out`: The binary representation of the input decimal number.

**Summary:**
The provided C++ code implements a function `decToBinary()` which takes an integer as input and prints its binary representation. The function first initializes an array `binaryNum` of size 32 to store the binary representation. It then starts iterating over the input integer `n` while it is greater than 0. At each iteration, it stores the remainder of `n` divided by 2 in the next index of the `binaryNum` array, and then updates `n` to `n/2`. The function then prints the binary representation in reverse order, starting from the last index of the `binaryNum` array.

**SystemC Equivalent Code:**

The SystemC code below captures the same logic as the C++ code above. It defines a module `DecToBin` that has two input ports of type `sc_in<int>` and one output port of type `sc_out<int>`. The `DecToBin` module has a process `convert` that iterates over the input integer and stores its binary representation in a local array `binaryNum` of type `sc_int<32>`. The `convert` process then prints the binary representation in reverse order, starting from the last index of the `binaryNum` array.
```
#include <systemc>

// DecToBin module
SC_MODULE(DecToBin) {
    // Inputs
    sc_in<int> dec_in;

    // Outputs
    sc_out<int> binary_out;

    // Local variables
    sc_int<32> binaryNum[32];
    int i = 0;

    // Function to convert decimal to binary
    void convert() {
        while (dec_in > 0) {
            // Store remainder in binary array
            binaryNum[i] = dec_in % 2;
            dec_in = dec_in / 2;
            i++;
        }

        // Print binary representation in reverse order
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined a module `DecToBin` that has two input ports `dec_in` and `binary_out`. The `dec_in` port is of type `sc_in<int>`, which means that it can receive integer values. The `binary_out` port is of type `sc_out<int>`, which means that it can send integer values.

The `DecToBin` module has a local array `binaryNum` of type `sc_int<32>` that is used to store the binary representation of the input integer. The `convert` process iterates over the input integer `dec_in` while it is greater than 0. At each iteration, it stores the remainder of `dec_in` divided by 2 in the next index of the `binaryNum` array, and then updates `dec_in` to `dec_in/2`. Finally, the `convert` process prints the binary representation in reverse order, starting from the last index of the `binaryNum` array.

Note that we have used the `sc_int<32>` type to define the `binaryNum` array, which means that each element of the array is a 32-bit signed integer. This ensures that the binary representation of the input integer is preserved accurately.
