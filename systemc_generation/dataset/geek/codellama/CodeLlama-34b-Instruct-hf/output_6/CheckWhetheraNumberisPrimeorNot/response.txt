  **Inputs and Outputs:**

The program takes an integer, `n`, as an input and outputs whether it is a prime number or not.

**Major Line or Block-by-Block Summary:**

The code first includes the standard C++ library header files.

The `main` function is defined, which is the entry point of the program. The function first initializes an integer `n` to 29.

The function then initializes an integer `cnt` to 0.

The function then checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function outputs that `n` is not prime.

Otherwise, the function enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n`. For each iteration, the function checks if `n` is divisible by the current number. If it is, the function increments `cnt`.

After the loop, the function checks if `cnt` is greater than 2. If it is, the function outputs that `n` is not prime. Otherwise, it outputs that `n` is prime.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
// SystemC module that checks if a number is prime
// using a simple trial division algorithm

#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(IsPrime) {
    sc_in<int> n;      // Integer to be tested for primality
    sc_out<bool> is_prime;  // output signal indicating whether n is prime or not

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(IsPrime) {
        // Define method to check for primality using trial division
        SC_METHOD(trial_division);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to perform trial division
    void trial_division() {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        if (cnt > 2) {
            is_prime.write(false);
        } else {
            is_prime.write(true);
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `IsPrime` that takes an integer input `n` and an output signal `is_prime`. The `is_prime` signal indicates whether `n` is prime or not.

The constructor of the module defines a method called `trial_division`. This method performs the trial division algorithm to check if `n` is prime. It initializes `cnt` to 0, then iterates from 1 to `n`. For each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by the current number. If it is, it increments `cnt`.

After the loop, it checks if `cnt` is greater than 2. If it is, it sets `is_prime` to `false`. Otherwise, it sets `is_prime` to `true`.

Note that the `is_prime` output signal is connected to the `trial_division` method, so it will be triggered whenever `n` changes. Also, we have included the `sc_in<int> n` and `sc_out<bool> is_prime` ports as defined in the instructions.
