  **Inputs:**

* `int year`: the year to be checked

**Outputs:**

* `bool is_leap_year`: boolean indicating whether the input year is a leap year

**Summary:**

The provided C++ code declares a function `checkYear` that takes an integer `year` as its sole parameter. The function checks whether the given year is a leap year or not, based on the following conditions:

1. If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
2. If the year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is not a leap year.
3. If the year is not divisible by 100 but is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
4. Otherwise, it is not a leap year.

The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the input year is a leap year or not.

In the `main` function, the user is asked to enter a year, which is then passed to the `checkYear` function. The result of the function is then printed to the console as either "Leap Year" or "Not a Leap Year".

**SystemC equivalent:**

Here is a SystemC equivalent of the provided C++ code, using the same signal names and structure as in the testbench:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    sc_in<int> year;
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;

    SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
        SC_METHOD(checkYear);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    void checkYear() {
        if (year % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year % 100 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        } else if (year % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a `LeapYearChecker` module that has an input `year` of type `int` and an output `is_leap_year` of type `bool`. The module has a single method `checkYear` that implements the logic of the `checkYear` function from the original C++ code. The method is triggered by `year` and sets the value of `is_leap_year` based on the result of the leap year check.

Note that in SystemC, we use the `write` method to set the value of output signals, instead of using `cout` as in the original C++ code. Also, we use the `sc_in` and `sc_out` types to declare input and output signals, respectively.
