  Inputs:

* `principal`: The principal amount of money being invested.
* `rate`: The interest rate as a percentage.
* `time`: The time period over which the money is invested.

Outputs:

* `ci`: The compound interest earned over the specified time period.

Line-by-line explanation:

1. `include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This line is a C++ library that includes many standard header files in C++.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line is a C++ directive that allows us to use the elements of the namespace without specify the namespace.
3. `main()`: This is the main function of the program.
4. `double principal = 10000, rate = 5, time = 2;`: These lines declare and initialize three variables: `principal`, `rate`, and `time`. They represent the principal amount of money being invested, the interest rate in percentage, and the time period over which the money is invested, respectively.
5. `double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)));`: This line calculates the compound interest using the formula: A = P * (1 + r/100)^t, where P is the principal, r is the interest rate in percentage, and t is the time period in years. The `pow` function is used to calculate the power of the expression inside the parentheses.
6. `double CI = A - principal;`: This line calculates the compound interest by subtracting the principal from the result of the compound interest formula.
7. `cout << "Compound interest is " << CI;`: This line prints the compound interest to the console.
8. `return 0;`: This line returns an integer value of 0 to the operating system to indicate that the program has ended successfully.

Equivalent SystemC code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CompoundInterest) {
  sc_in<double> principal;
  sc_in<double> rate;
  sc_in<double> time;
  sc_out<double> ci;

  SC_CTOR(CompoundInterest) {
    SC_METHOD(calculate_compound_interest);
    sensitive << principal << rate << time;
  }

  void calculate_compound_interest() {
    ci.write(principal.read() * pow((1 + rate.read() / 100.0), time.read()));
  }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have created a module called `CompoundInterest` with the following inputs and outputs:

* Inputs:
	+ `principal`: The principal amount of money being invested.
	+ `rate`: The interest rate as a percentage.
	+ `time`: The time period over which the money is invested.
* Outputs:
	+ `ci`: The compound interest earned over the specified time period.

The `calculate_compound_interest` method in the `CompoundInterest` module performs the calculation of compound interest using the same formula as the original C++/C code. The `sensitive` keyword is used to specify that the `calculate_compound_interest` method should be triggered whenever any of the inputs (`principal`, `rate`, or `time`) changes.
