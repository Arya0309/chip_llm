  **Inputs:**

* `nums`: The array of integers to be sorted.
* `len`: The length of the array.

**Outputs:**

* The sorted array `nums`.
* The signal indicating the start of the sorting process.
* The signal indicating the end of the sorting process.

**Description:**
The code is a C++ program that sorts an array of integers using the bubble sort algorithm. The program takes two inputs:

1. `nums`: The array of integers to be sorted.
2. `len`: The length of the array.

The program first prints the initial array and then sorts it using the bubble sort algorithm. The bubble sort algorithm works by repeatedly iterating through the array and swapping any adjacent elements that are out of order. The program continues to loop through the array until no swaps are made, at which point the array is sorted.

The program then prints the sorted array and returns 0 to indicate that the sorting process is complete.

**SystemC Code:**

The following is a SystemC code that reflects the same behavior as the C++ code.
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>
#include <iostream>

// Module that sorts an array of integers using bubble sort algorithm
SC_MODULE(Sort) {
    sc_in<int> nums[10];                          // Array of 10 input ports for the integers
    sc_out<int> sorted_nums[10];                  // Array of 10 output ports for the sorted integers
    sc_in<bool> start;                            // Input port to start the sorting process
    sc_out<bool> done;                            // Output port to indicate the end of the sorting process

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Sort) {
        // Process to sort the array
        SC_METHOD(sort_array);
        sensitive << start;
    }

    // Method to perform the sorting
    void sort_array() {
        // Loop through the array and swap any adjacent elements that are out of order
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < 10 - i; j++) {
                if (nums[j] < nums[j - 1]) {
                    // Swap elements
                    int temp = nums[j];
                    nums[j] = nums[j - 1];
                    nums[j - 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
        done.write(true); // Indicate that the sorting process is complete
    }
};
```
In the above code, we have defined a module `Sort` that has the following ports:

* `nums[10]`: An array of 10 input ports for the integers to be sorted.
* `sorted_nums[10]`: An array of 10 output ports for the sorted integers.
* `start`: An input port to start the sorting process.
* `done`: An output port to indicate the end of the sorting process.

The module has a process `sort_array` that performs the following steps:

1. Loops through the array and swaps any adjacent elements that are out of order.
2. Indicates that the sorting process is complete by writing a value of 1 to the `done` output port.

Note that the `sort_array` process is sensitive to the `start` input port, which means that it will be triggered whenever the value of `start` changes from 0 to 1. When the `start` input port is 0, the `sort_array` process is idle and will not execute.

In summary, the SystemC code provided above faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow to generate a hardware implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.
