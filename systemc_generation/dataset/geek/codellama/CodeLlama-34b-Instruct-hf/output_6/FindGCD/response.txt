  **Inputs**:

* a: An integer input signal
* b: An integer input signal

**Outputs**:

* gcd_result: An integer output signal indicating the greatest common divisor of a and b

**Summary**:

The provided C++ code implements a function named `gcd` that takes two integer inputs `a` and `b` and returns an integer output `gcd_result`. The function finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using a simple arithmetic approach.

To do this, the function first finds the minimum of `a` and `b` using the `min` function from the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file. This minimum value is stored in the `res` variable.

Next, the function tests whether the current `res` value is greater than 1. If it is not, the function returns `res` as the GCD of `a` and `b`.

If the current `res` value is greater than 1, the function decreases `res` by 1 and tests whether `a` and `b` are both divisible by `res`. If they are, the function sets `res` as the GCD and returns it.

If `a` and `b` are not divisible by `res`, the function repeats the process with the next smaller value of `res`.

**Equivalent SystemC Code**:

Here is an example of SystemC code that implements the same logic as the provided C++ code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(GCD) {
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;
    sc_out<int> gcd_result;

    SC_CTOR(GCD) {
        SC_METHOD(find_gcd);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    void find_gcd() {
        int min = sc_min(a.read(), b.read());
        int res = min;
        bool found = false;

        while (res > 1 && !found) {
            if (a.read() % res == 0 && b.read() % res == 0) {
                found = true;
            } else {
                res--;
            }
        }

        if (found) {
            gcd_result.write(res);
        } else {
            gcd_result.write(1);
        }
    }
};
```
In this code, we define a SystemC module named `GCD` that has two input ports `a` and `b` and one output port `gcd_result`. The module has a single method named `find_gcd` that implements the logic of the original C++ code.

The `find_gcd` method starts by finding the minimum of `a` and `b` using the `sc_min` function from the `<systemc/kernel/sc_let.hpp>` header file. It then initializes two variables `int res = min` and `bool found = false`.

The method then enters a loop that iterates while `res` is greater than 1 and `found` is false. In each iteration, the method checks whether `a` and `b` are both divisible by `res`. If they are, the method sets `found` to true and sets `gcd_result` to `res`. If not, the method decreases `res` by 1.

If the loop terminates and `found` is still false, the method sets `gcd_result` to 1.
