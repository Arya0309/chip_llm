  **Inputs:**

* `a`: An integer that represents the first number in the range of 1 to 100.
* `b`: An integer that represents the second number in the range of 1 to 100.

**Outputs:**

* `lcm_result`: An integer that represents the least common multiple of the two input numbers.

**Summary:**

The provided C++ code is a simple program that calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the if statement and while loop. The program first prompts the user to enter two numbers between 1 and 100, and then it uses the ternary operator to determine the larger number. Finally, the program uses a while loop to iterate through the numbers until it finds the LCM, which is the first number that is completely divisible by both `a` and `b`.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LCM) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> lcm_result;  // Output port for the least common multiple

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LCM) {
        // Process to perform LCM calculation
        SC_METHOD(calc_lcm);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to calculate the least common multiple
    void calc_lcm() {
        int max_num = (a.read() > b.read()) ? a.read() : b.read();
        int flag = 1;
        while (flag) {
            if (max_num % a.read() == 0 && max_num % b.read() == 0) {
                lcm_result.write(max_num);
                break;
            }
            max_num++;
        }
    }
};
```
