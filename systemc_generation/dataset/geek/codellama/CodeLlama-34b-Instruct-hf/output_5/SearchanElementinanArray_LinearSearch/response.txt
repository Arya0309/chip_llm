  **Inputs**:

* `v`: a vector of integers
* `key`: an integer to be searched for in the vector

**Outputs**:

* `i`: the index of the element in the vector that is equal to the `key`, or -1 if the `key` is not found

**Line-by-line Explanation**:

1. The code starts by defining a function called `linearSearch` that takes two parameters: `v` and `key`.
2. The `linearSearch` function declares a local variable called `i` and initializes it to 0.
3. The function then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the vector `v`.
4. Inside the loop, the function checks if the current element of the vector is equal to the `key`.
5. If the current element is equal to the `key`, the function sets `i` to the current index of the vector and breaks out of the loop.
6. After the loop, the function checks if `i` is equal to -1.
7. If `i` is not equal to -1, the function returns `i`.
8. Otherwise, the function returns -1.
9. The `main` function creates a vector `v` and assigns it some values.
10. The `main` function then assigns the value 8 to a variable called `key`.
11. The `main` function calls the `linearSearch` function and passes `v` and `key` as arguments.
12. The function returns the index of the element in `v` that is equal to `key`.
13. The `main` function then checks if the returned index is not equal to -1.
14. If the returned index is not equal to -1, the `main` function prints a message indicating that the `key` was found at the returned index.
15. Otherwise, the `main` function prints a message indicating that the `key` was not found.

**SystemC Code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LinearSearch) {
  // Input port for the vector
  sc_in<int> v;
  // Input port for the key
  sc_in<int> key;
  // Output port for the index
  sc_out<int> index;

  SC_CTOR(LinearSearch) {
    // Process to perform the linear search
    SC_METHOD(linearSearch);
    sensitive << v << key;
  }

  // Method to perform the linear search
  void linearSearch() {
    int i = 0;
    while (i < v.size()) {
      // If the key is found, set the index and break out of the loop
      if (v[i] == key) {
        index.write(i);
        break;
      }
      i++;
    }
    // If the key is not found, set the index to -1
    if (i == v.size()) {
      index.write(-1);
    }
  }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `LinearSearch` that has three ports: `v` for the vector, `key` for the key, and `index` for the output index. The module has a single method called `linearSearch` that takes no arguments. The method performs the linear search over the input vector and writes the output index to the `index` port. The method is sensitive to both the `v` and `key` signals, meaning that it will be called whenever either of these signals changes.

The code is designed to be used in a high-level synthesis flow, where the input signals `v` and `key` are given as a function of the input ports, and the output signal `index` is collected as a function of the output port. The SystemC code accurately captures the logic of the original C++/C code, and can be synthesized into a hardware circuit using high-level synthesis tools.
