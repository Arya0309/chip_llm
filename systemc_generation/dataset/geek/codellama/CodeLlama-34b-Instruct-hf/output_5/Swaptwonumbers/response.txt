  **Inputs:**

* `a`: The first integer to be swapped.
* `b`: The second integer to be swapped.

**Outputs:**

* `a`: The swapped value of the first integer.
* `b`: The swapped value of the second integer.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code is a simple program that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, and swaps their values using a temporary variable `temp`. The swapped values are then printed to the console.

The code first prints the initial values of `a` and `b` to the console using the `cout` statement. It then declares a temporary variable `temp` and assigns it the value of `a`. The value of `b` is then assigned to `a`, and the original value of `a` is assigned to `b`. Finally, the swapped values of `a` and `b` are printed to the console.

**Equivalent SystemC Code:**

Here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source:
```c++
#include <systemc.h>

// Swap module
SC_MODULE(Swap) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first integer
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second integer
    sc_out<int> swap_a;  // Output port for the swapped first integer
    sc_out<int> swap_b;  // Output port for the swapped second integer

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Swap) {
        // Process to perform swapping
        SC_METHOD(swap);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to swap the values
    void swap() {
        int temp = a.read();
        a.write(b.read());
        b.write(temp);
        swap_a.write(a.read());
        swap_b.write(b.read());
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined a module `Swap` that takes two input ports `a` and `b` for the first and second integers, respectively. We also have two output ports `swap_a` and `swap_b` for the swapped values of the first and second integers, respectively.

The constructor of the `Swap` module declares a process called `swap` that is sensitive to changes in `a` and `b`. Whenever there is a change in `a` or `b`, the process will execute the `swap` method.

The `swap` method first declares a temporary variable `temp` and assigns it the value of `a`. It then assigns the value of `b` to `a`, and assigns the original value of `a` to `b`. Finally, it writes the swapped values of `a` and `b` to the output ports `swap_a` and `swap_b`, respectively.

Note that we have used the `read` and `write` methods to access the values of the signals, which is the recommended practice in SystemC. We have also used the `sensitive` keyword to make the `swap` process sensitive to changes in `a` and `b`.
