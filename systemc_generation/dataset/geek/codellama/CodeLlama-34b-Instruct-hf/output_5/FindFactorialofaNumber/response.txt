  **Inputs and Outputs**

Inputs:

* `num`: The integer for which the factorial is calculated.
* `res`: The result of the factorial calculation.

Outputs:

* `factorial(num)`: The result of the factorial calculation for the input number.

**Summary**

The provided C++ code implements a function called `factorial` that takes an unsigned integer `n` as input and returns its factorial. The function calculates the factorial by iterating over the numbers from 2 to `n` and multiplying them together. The result is stored in the `res` variable and returned at the end of the function.

The `main` function calls the `factorial` function with an input value of 5 and prints the result to the console.

**SystemC Code Snippet**

The following SystemC code snippet implements the same logic as the provided C++ code, using the `sc_in` and `sc_out` types to define the input and output ports, respectively.
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates the factorial of an unsigned integer
SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> num;  // Input port for the integer
    sc_out<unsigned int> result; // Output port for the factorial

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
        // Process to perform factorial calculation
        SC_METHOD(calc);
        sensitive << num;
    }

    // Method to calculate the factorial
    void calc() {
        // Initialize the result to 1
        result.write(1);
        // Iterate over the numbers from 2 to num and multiply them together
        for (int i = 2; i <= num.read(); i++) {
            result.write(result.read() * i);
        }
    }
};
```
