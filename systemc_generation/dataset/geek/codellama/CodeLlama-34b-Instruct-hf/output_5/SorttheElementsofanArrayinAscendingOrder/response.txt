  **Input(s) and Output(s)**

* Inputs:
	+ `num`: An integer array that contains the numbers to be sorted.
	+ `len`: The length of the `num` array.
* Outputs:
	+ `num`: The sorted integer array.

**Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation**

The provided C++/C code is a brute-force sorting algorithm that uses the bubble sort approach to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The code contains three functions: `main`, `sort`, and `swapNums`.

1. `main`: This is the driver function that initializes the array of integers to be sorted and calls the `sort` function to perform the sorting.
2. `sort`: This function implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort the array of integers. It has a nested loop structure where the outer loop iterates `len` times, and the inner loop iterates `len - i` times. In each iteration of the inner loop, the function checks if the current element is smaller than the previous element and swaps them if necessary. The function also takes advantage of the flag `isSwapped` to check if any swap occurred in the inner loop. If no swap occurred, the function breaks the outer loop.
3. `swapNums`: This is a utility function that swaps two elements in the array. It takes two indices as input and swaps the corresponding elements in the array.

**SystemC Code Generation**

To generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet, we need to identify the inputs and outputs of the provided C++/C code. The inputs are `num` and `len`, and the output is the sorted array `num`. We can generate the following SystemC code snippet:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BubbleSort) {
    sc_in<int> num[]; // Input array
    sc_in<int> len; // Length of input array
    sc_out<int> sorted_num[]; // Output sorted array

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BubbleSort) {
        // Process to perform sorting
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << num << len;
    }

    // Method to perform sorting
    void sort() {
        bool isSwapped = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            isSwapped = false;
            for (int j = 1; j < len - i; j++) {
                if (num[j] < num[j - 1]) {
                    swapNums(j, j - 1);
                    isSwapped = true;
                }
            }
            if (!isSwapped) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // Utility function to swap elements in array
    void swapNums(int i, int j) {
        int curr = num[i];
        num[i] = num[j];
        num[j] = curr;
    }
};
```
Here, we define an SC_MODULE with input and output ports `num`, `len`, and `sorted_num`, respectively. The constructor initializes the `sort` method, which performs the sorting operation. The `sort` method uses a nested loop structure to sort the array of integers. In the inner loop, the method checks if the current element is smaller than the previous element and swaps them if necessary. The `swapNums` utility function is used to swap the elements in the array.

Note that we have not included the `main` function in the SystemC code snippet, as it is not necessary for the high-level synthesis flow. The `main` function is only used to initialize the array of integers to be sorted and call the `sort` function. The SystemC code snippet can be used in a high-level synthesis flow to generate the HDL netlist for the bubble sort algorithm.
