  **Inputs:**

* `n`: the size of the array

**Outputs:**

* `arr`: the sorted array

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code is a program that sorts an array of integers using the selection sort algorithm. The program defines three functions: `swap`, which swaps two array elements, `selectionSort`, which performs the selection sort algorithm, and `printArray`, which prints the sorted array.

The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It initializes the array `arr` with the values `{64, 25, 12, 22, 11}` and its size `n = 5`. It then calls the `selectionSort` function, passing `arr` and `n` as arguments. The `selectionSort` function sorts the array in place and returns nothing. Finally, the `main` function prints the sorted array using the `printArray` function.

The `selectionSort` function first initializes three variables: `i` to 0, `j` to 1, and `min_idx` to 0. It then enters a loop that iterates `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Inside the loop, it first finds the minimum element in the unsorted subarray by initializing `min_idx` to `i` and then iterating `j` from `i+1` to `n`. If the element at index `j` is less than the element at index `min_idx`, `min_idx` is updated to `j`. Finally, the subroutine swaps the elements at indexes `min_idx` and `i`.

The `swap` function is called to swap the elements at indexes `min_idx` and `i`. This step is crucial in the selection sort algorithm, as it ensures that the smallest element is moved to the beginning of the unsorted subarray.

The `printArray` function is called to print the sorted array. It iterates over the array and prints each element.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc>

// Module that sorts an array of integers using the selection sort algorithm
SC_MODULE(SelectionSort) {
    sc_in<bool> clk; // Clock signal
    sc_in<int> start; // Start signal (used to trigger the sorting)
    sc_out<int> done; // Done signal (indicates the sorting is complete)
    sc_in<int> arr[5]; // Input array (the size of the array is fixed to 5)

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SelectionSort) {
        // Sorting process
        SC_THREAD(selectionSort);
        sensitive << clk;
    }

    // Selection sort algorithm
    void selectionSort() {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 1;
        int min_idx = 0;

        // Loop until the end of the array is reached
        while (i < 5) {
            // Find the minimum element in the unsorted subarray
            min_idx = i;
            for (j = i + 1; j < 5; j += 1) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) {
                    min_idx = j;
                }
            }

            // Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted subarray
            sc_uint<32> temp = arr[min_idx];
            arr[min_idx] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;

            // Increment i to move the boundary of the unsorted subarray
            i += 1;
        }

        // Print the sorted array
        printArray(arr, 5);

        // Indicate the sorting is complete by setting the done signal high
        done.write(true);
    }

    // Function to print the sorted array
    void printArray(int arr[5], int size) {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            std::cout << arr[i] << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `SelectionSort` that performs the selection sort algorithm on an array of integers. The module has four ports: `clk` (clock signal), `start` (start signal), `done` (done signal), and `arr` (input array).

The `SelectionSort` module is implemented as a thread that is triggered by the rising edge of the `clk` signal. Inside the thread, we first initialize three variables: `i` to 0, `j` to 1, and `min_idx` to 0. We then enter a loop that iterates `i` from 0 to 4. Inside the loop, we first find the minimum element in the unsorted subarray by initializing `min_idx` to `i` and then iterating `j` from `i+1` to 4. If the element at index `j` is less than the element at index `min_idx`, `min_idx` is updated to `j`. Finally, we swap the elements at indexes `min_idx` and `i`.

At the end of the loop, we print the sorted array using the `printArray` function and indicate the sorting is complete by setting the `done` signal high.

Note that we use `sc_uint<32>` to represent the array elements instead of `int` to ensure that the array can hold integer values up to 32 bits.
