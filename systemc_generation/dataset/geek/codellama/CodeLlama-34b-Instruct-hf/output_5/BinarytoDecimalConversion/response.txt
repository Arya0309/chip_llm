  **Inputs**

* `binary_in`: An integer input that represents a binary number.
* `decimal_out`: An integer output that represents the corresponding decimal number.

**Outputs**

* `decimal_out`: An integer output that represents the decimal equivalent of the binary input.

**Summary**

The provided C++/C code is a function named `binaryToDecimal` that takes an integer input representing a binary number and returns the decimal equivalent of that binary number.

The function first initializes a variable `num` with the input `n`, and then sets two variables `dec_value` and `base` to 0 and 1, respectively. It then enters a loop that will continue until the `temp` variable, which is initially set to `num`, is 0.

Inside the loop, the function extracts the last digit of `temp` by taking its remainder when divided by 10. It then divides `temp` by 10 and updates the `dec_value` with the result of multiplying the last digit by `base`. Finally, it updates the `base` to `base * 2`.

The loop continues until `temp` is 0, at which point the function returns the `dec_value`.

**Generated SystemC Code**
```
SC_MODULE(BinaryToDecimal) {
    sc_in<int> binary_in;
    sc_out<int> decimal_out;

    void binaryToDecimal() {
        int num = binary_in.read();
        int dec_value = 0;
        int base = 1;

        int temp = num;
        while (temp != 0) {
            int last_digit = temp % 10;
            temp = temp / 10;
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base *= 2;
        }

        decimal_out.write(dec_value);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have created a module named `BinaryToDecimal` with two ports: `binary_in` and `decimal_out`. The `binaryToDecimal` function is called on the running process of the module. It reads the input from `binary_in`, sets up the necessary variables `num`, `dec_value`, and `base`, and then executes the loop to calculate the decimal equivalent of the binary input. Finally, it writes the result to `decimal_out`.

Note that we have used the `read` and `write` methods to access the signals, which is the recommended way to access signals in SystemC. Also, we have named the ports according to the inputs and outputs of the original C++/C code to facilitate the integration with the testbench.
