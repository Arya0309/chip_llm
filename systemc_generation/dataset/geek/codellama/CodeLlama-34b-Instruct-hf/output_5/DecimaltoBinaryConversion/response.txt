  **Inputs:**

* `n`: an integer to be converted to binary

**Outputs:**

* `binaryNum`: an array of integers storing the binary representation of `n`

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. `using namespace std;`: This line tells the compiler to use the standard namespace.
2. `int decToBinary(int n)`: This line declares a function `decToBinary` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer array representing the binary representation of `n`.
3. `int binaryNum[32]`: This line declares an integer array `binaryNum` with a size of 32 elements.
4. `int i = 0`: This line declares an integer variable `i` and initializes it to 0.
5. `while (n > 0)`: This line starts a while loop that will run until `n` is greater than 0.
6. `binaryNum[i] = n % 2`: This line stores the remainder of `n` divided by 2 in the `i`th element of the `binaryNum` array.
7. `n = n / 2`: This line divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n` for the next iteration of the loop.
8. `i++`: This line increments the value of `i` by 1.
9. `for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)`: This line starts a for loop that will run from `i - 1` to 0 (inclusive), and will decrement `j` by 1 for each iteration.
10. `cout << binaryNum[j]`: This line prints the `j`th element of the `binaryNum` array.
11. `return 0`: This line returns 0 to indicate that the function has completed successfully.

**SystemC Code:**
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DecToBinary) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in; // Map to the dec_in signal
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Map to the binary_out signal

    void decToBinary() {
        // Array to store binary number
        int binaryNum[32];
    
        // Counter for binary array
        int i = 0;
    
        // Convert decimal to binary
        while (dec_in.read() > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = dec_in.read() % 2;
            dec_in.write(dec_in.read() / 2);
            i++;
        }
    
        // Output binary number
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
        }
    }
};
```
In the above SystemC code, we have mapped the `dec_in` and `binary_out` signals to the corresponding ports. The `decToBinary` function performs the conversion and outputs the result to the `binary_out` port.

**Note:** The above SystemC code is a logical equivalent of the given C++/C code. It does not include any error handling or boundary checks, which should be added for a complete and robust SystemC design.
