  **Inputs:**

* `m[][]`: a 2D array of integers with dimensions `n x n`, where `n` is a constant integer defined at the beginning of the code.
* `n`: a constant integer that represents the size of the square matrix.

**Outputs:**

* `m[][]`: the input matrix with the first and last rows swapped.

**Line-by-Line Summary:**

The code starts by defining the input matrix `m[][]` and the size of the matrix `n`. It then defines a function `interchangeFirstLast` that takes a 2D integer array as input.

The function first finds the number of rows in the input matrix using `n`. It then iterates over the first and last rows of the input matrix, using a loop that runs `n` times, and swaps the element values of the first and last rows.

The `main` function is then executed, which creates a 4x4 integer array `m` with the input values. It then calls the `interchangeFirstLast` function with `m` as the argument.

The function returns the input matrix `m` with the first and last rows swapped. The resulting matrix is then printed to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(RowSwapper) {
    sc_in<int> in[4]; // Input port for the first row
    sc_in<int> out[4]; // Output port for the last row

    // Process to swap the first and last rows
    SC_METHOD(swap) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int temp = in[i];
            in[i] = out[i];
            out[i] = temp;
        }
    }
};

```
In the above SystemC code, we define a module `RowSwapper` with two input ports `in` and `out` and no output ports. The `in` port is used to receive the first row of the matrix, and the `out` port is used to receive the last row of the matrix.

The `swap` process takes place inside the `RowSwapper` module, which iterates over the first and last rows of the input matrix and swaps the element values.

The `main` function in the testbench can then use the `RowSwapper` module to swap the first and last rows of the matrix.
