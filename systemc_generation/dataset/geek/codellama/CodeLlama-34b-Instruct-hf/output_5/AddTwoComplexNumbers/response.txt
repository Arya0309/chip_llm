**Line-by-line Summary:**

1. `// Importing all libraries`: The code imports the standard C++ libraries.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line tells the compiler to use the standard C++ namespace, which makes it easier to use the standard library functions.
3. `class Complex`: This line declares a new class called "Complex".
4. `public: int real, imaginary;`: This line declares two public variables called "real" and "imaginary" that will store the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.
5. `Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)`: This line declares a constructor for the "Complex" class. The constructor takes two optional arguments: "tempReal" and "tempImaginary", which default to 0 if not provided.
6. `real = tempReal; imaginary = tempImaginary;`: These lines set the values of the "real" and "imaginary" variables to the values provided by the constructor.
7. `addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)`: This line declares a member function called "addComp" that takes two "Complex" objects as arguments.
8. `Complex temp;`: This line creates a local variable called "temp" of type "Complex".
9. `temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;`: This line sets the real part of "temp" to the sum of the real parts of "C1" and "C2".
10. `temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);`: This line sets the imaginary part of "temp" to the sum of the imaginary parts of "C1" and "C2".
11. `return temp;`: This line returns the "temp" object.
12. `int main()`: This line declares the main function of the program.
13. `Complex C1(3, 2);`: This line creates a "Complex" object called "C1" with a real part of 3 and an imaginary part of 2.
14. `Complex C2(9, 5);`: This line creates a "Complex" object called "C2" with a real part of 9 and an imaginary part of 5.
15. `Complex C3;`: This line creates a "Complex" object called "C3" with default values of 0 for the real and imaginary parts.
16. `C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);` This line adds the values of "C1" and "C2" using the "addComp" function and assigns the result to "C3".
17. `cout << "Sum of complex number : " <<  C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;`: This line prints the real and imaginary parts of "C3" to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
  sc_in<int> real1;
  sc_in<int> imag1;
  sc_in<int> real2;
  sc_in<int> imag2;

  void run() {
    Complex C1(real1.read(), imag1.read());
    Complex C2(real2.read(), imag2.read());
    Complex C3 = C1.addComp(C2);
    real_sum.write(C3.real.read());
    imag_sum.write(C3.imaginary.read());
  }

  SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
    SC_METHOD(run);
    sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
  }
};
```
In this code, we define a "ComplexAdder" module that has four input signals (real1, imag1, real2, and imag2) and two output signals (real_sum and imag_sum). The module has a single method called "run" that takes no arguments. The method reads the values of the input signals and uses them to create two "Complex" objects called "C1" and "C2". It then adds the two complex numbers using the "addComp" function and assigns the result to a temporary "Complex" object called "C3". Finally, the method writes the real and imaginary parts of "C3" to the "real_sum" and "imag_sum" output signals.

The constructor of the "ComplexAdder" module initializes the method "run" to be sensitive to changes in the input signals. This means that whenever one of the input signals changes, the "run" method will be called automatically.
