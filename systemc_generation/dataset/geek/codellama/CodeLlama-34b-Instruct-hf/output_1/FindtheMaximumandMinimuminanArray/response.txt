  **Inputs**

* `arr`: An array of integers to be searched.
* `n`: The size of the `arr` array.

**Outputs**

* `min_val`: The minimum value found in the `arr` array.
* `max_val`: The maximum value found in the `arr` array.

**Summary**
The provided C++/C code is a program that finds the minimum and maximum elements in an array. The program defines two functions: `getMin` and `getMax`. These functions use the C++ standard library functions `std::min_element` and `std::max_element` to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array, respectively. The program then calls these functions with the `arr` array and its size `n` as arguments.

In `getMin`, the program uses `std::min_element` to find the minimum element in the range `[arr, arr + n)`. The range is specified using iterators, which are pointers to the first and one past the last elements in the range. To get the minimum value, the program dereferences the iterator returned by `std::min_element` to get the minimum element itself.

In `getMax`, the program uses `std::max_element` to find the maximum element in the range `[arr, arr + n)`. The range is specified using iterators, which are pointers to the first and one past the last elements in the range. To get the maximum value, the program dereferences the iterator returned by `std::max_element` to get the maximum element itself.

**SystemC Code**

The following SystemC code preserves the logic of the original C++/C code and incorporates the provided signals:
```c++
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that finds the minimum and maximum elements in an array
SC_MODULE(ArrayMinMax) {
    // Input ports
    sc_in<int> arr;
    sc_in<int> n;

    // Output ports
    sc_out<int> min_val;
    sc_out<int> max_val;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArrayMinMax) {
        // Process to find the minimum and maximum elements
        SC_METHOD(findMinMax);
        sensitive << arr << n;
    }

    // Method to find the minimum and maximum elements
    void findMinMax() {
        int min_temp = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
        int max_temp = std::numeric_limits<int>::min();

        for (int i = 0; i < n.read(); i++) {
            int curr_val = arr.read();
            if (curr_val < min_temp) {
                min_temp = curr_val;
            }
            if (curr_val > max_temp) {
                max_temp = curr_val;
            }
        }

        min_val.write(min_temp);
        max_val.write(max_temp);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the module `ArrayMinMax` has three input ports: `arr`, `n`, and `clk`. The module also has two output ports: `min_val` and `max_val`. These ports are used to read the input array, the size of the array, and the minimum and maximum values found in the array, respectively. The module has one process called `findMinMax` that implements the logic to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array. The process is triggered by the input ports `arr` and `n`.

Inside the process, the code declares two variables: `min_temp` and `max_temp`. These variables are used to store the minimum and maximum values found in the array, respectively. The code then iterates over the elements in the array using a `for` loop. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and iterates up to `n.read()` - 1. Inside the loop, the code reads the current element from the array using the `arr.read()` method. The code then compares the current element with the current minimum and maximum values. If the current element is less than the current minimum value, the code updates the minimum value and sets the `min_temp` variable to the new minimum value. Similarly, if the current element is greater than the current maximum value, the code updates the maximum value and sets the `max_temp` variable to the new maximum value.

After the loop finishes, the code writes the minimum and maximum values to the output ports `min_val` and `max_val`, respectively. The code does this using the `write` method of the output ports.

The `ArrayMinMax` module can be instantiated and configured in a SystemC design using the following code:
```c++
ArrayMinMax amm("amm");
amm.arr(arr);
amm.n(n);
amm.min_val(min_val);
amm.max_val(max_val);
```
In this code, the `amm` module is instantiated with the name `"amm"`. The input ports `arr`, `n`, and `min_val` are connected to the signals `arr`, `n`, and `min_val` in the design, respectively. Similarly, the output port `max_val` is connected to the signal `max_val` in the design. The code then configures the `ccess` port of the `amm` module to have the value of the `clk` signal.
