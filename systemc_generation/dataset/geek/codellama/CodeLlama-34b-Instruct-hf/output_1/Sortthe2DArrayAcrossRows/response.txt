  **C++/C Code Summary**:

The given code is a C++ program to sort a 2D matrix row-wise. The input is a 2D integer matrix, and the output is the sorted matrix.

The program first includes necessary libraries. Then, it defines the `swap` function to swap two elements of an integer array. The `sortRowWise` function is the main logic of the program, which sorts the matrix row-wise. It iterates through each row of the matrix and performs a bubble sort on each row. The bubble sort compares adjacent elements in each row and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Finally, the `main` function is the driver code that tests the `sortRowWise` function with a given input matrix and prints the sorted matrix.

**SystemC Code**:

The following SystemC code captures the logic of the C++/C code to sort a 2D matrix row-wise:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to sort a 2D matrix row-wise
SC_MODULE(Sort2D) {
    // Input ports for the matrix and its dimensions
    sc_in<int> m[MAX_ROWS][MAX_COLS];
    sc_in<int> r;
    sc_in<int> c;

    // Output port for the sorted matrix
    sc_out<int> result[MAX_ROWS][MAX_COLS];

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Sort2D) {
        // Initialize the input ports and output ports
        m.init();
        r.init();
        c.init();
        result.init();

        // Process to sort the matrix row-wise
        SC_METHOD(sortRowWise);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to sort the matrix row-wise
    void sortRowWise() {
        // Loop through each row of the matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            // Loop through each column of the matrix
            for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                // Bubble sort on each row
                for (int k = 0; k < c - j - 1; k++) {
                    if (m[i][k] > m[i][k + 1]) {
                        swap(m[i][k], m[i][k + 1]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Assign the sorted result to the output port
        result.write(m);
    }

    // Function to swap two elements of an integer array
    static void swap(int *xp, int *yp) {
        int temp = *xp;
        *xp = *yp;
        *yp = temp;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `Sort2D` that has input ports for the matrix and its dimensions, and an output port for the sorted matrix. The constructor initializes the input and output ports and defines a process to perform the sort. The `sortRowWise` method sorts the matrix row-wise using a bubble sort algorithm. We also define a `swap` function to swap two elements of an integer array.

The `SC_METHOD` block defines the process that runs the `sortRowWise` method and is triggered when the input ports change. The `sensitive` keyword specifies that the process should be sensitive to changes in the input ports.

Note that this code uses a fixed size for the matrix, so it may not work for matrices with different dimensions. To make it more flexible, we can use a dynamical size for the matrix and adjust the buffer size accordingly.
