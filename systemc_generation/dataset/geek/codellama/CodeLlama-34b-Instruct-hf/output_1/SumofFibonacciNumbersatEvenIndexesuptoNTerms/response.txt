  Inputs:

* n: The integer value of Fibonacci number position.
* fibo[]: Array to store the Fibonacci numbers.
* sum: The sum of even-indiced Fibonacci numbers

Outputs:

* sum: The value of the sum of even-indiced Fibonacci numbers up to position n.

Natural Language Summary:
The C++/C code provided calculates the sum of even-indiced Fibonacci numbers up to position n. It first initializes the first element of fibo array to 0 and the second to 1. Then it loops through the array index i from 2 to 2*n and calculates the i-th Fibonacci number by adding the i-1st and i-2nd Fibonacci numbers. If the index is even-indiced, the code adds the Fibonacci number at that index to the sum. After all the Fibonacci numbers have been calculated, the code returns the sum.

SystemC Code:

To preserve the logic of the original code in our SystemC equivalent, we need to create a module that takes in the input n and output sum, then calculates the even-indiced sum of Fibonacci numbers up to position n. We can do this by creating a Module that has an input port for n and an output port for sum, along with a function that calculates the sum.

```
#include<systemc.h>
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// Adder module
SC_MODULE(Adder){
	sc_in<int> n;
	sc_out<int> sum;

// Method to calculate sum
	void calculateSum(){
		int fibo[2*n+1];
		fibo[0] = 0;
		fibo[1] = 1;
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 2; i <= 2*n; i++){
			fibo[i] = fibo[i-1] + fibo[i-2];
			if(i%2 == 0){
				sum += fibo[i];

			}
		}
		sum.write(sum);
	}

}

```


In the module, we have an input port for n and an output port for sum, both of type int. Then, we have a method called calculateSum that takes no input and has no output. This method initializes the fibo array to size 2n+1, and initializes the first two elements to 0 and 1. It also initializes the sum variable to 0. Then, it loops through the fibo array indices i from 2 to 2n, calculates the ith Fibonacci number by adding the ith-1st and ith-2nd Fibonacci numbers, and adds the Fibonacci number at that index to the sum if the index is even-indiced. After the loop, the method writes the sum to the output port sum.

Now, we need to create a SystemC testbench that instantiates the Adder module, inputs n and output sum, and tests the calculation of even-indiced Fibonacci numbers up to n. We can do this by defining an SC_MODULE called Testbench that has an instance of the Adder module, input and output ports for n and sum, and a test method to call the calculateSum method.
```
#include<systemc.h>
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// Adder module
SC_MODULE(Adder){
	sc_in<int> n;
	sc_out<int> sum;

// Method to calculate sum
	void calculateSum(){
		int fibo[2*n+1];
		fibo[0] = 0;
		fibo[1] = 1;
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 2; i <= 2*n; i++){
			fibo[i] = fibo[i-1] + fibo[i-2];
			if(i%2 == 0){
				sum += fibo[i];

			}
		}
		sum.write(sum);
	}

}

SC_MODULE(Testbench){
sc_in<int> n;
sc_out<int> sum;
Adder adder;

// Test method
void test(){
int n = 8;
int actual = adder.calculateSum();
int expected = 233;
cout << " Even indexed Fibonacci Sum upto " << n << ": " << actual << endl;
assert(actual == expected);
}

SC_CTOR(Testbench){
adder.n = n;
adder.sum = sum;
adder.calculateSum();
test();
}

}

```

So, this creates an SC_MODULE called Testbench and recongnises modules like Adder. In constuctor, we create a Adder object and assign n and sum as input and output ports of Adder module and call the calculateSum method. In the test method, we set actual as the return value of the calculateSum method and expected as 233. Then we print on console the actual value, the expected value, and the result of the comparison using cout, and test it using assert.

Now let us use SystemC to simulate and see the output of the circuit.
