  **Inputs:**

* `a`: An integer input
* `b`: An integer input

**Outputs:**

* `out_a`: An integer output, set to the original value of `a`
* `out_b`: An integer output, set to the original value of `b`

**Code Summary:**

The provided C++/C code is a simple program that swaps two integers `a` and `b` using a third temporary variable `temp`. The program first prints the values of `a` and `b` to the console using `std::cout`, then applies the swapping algorithm using the temporary variable. Finally, it prints the swapped values of `a` and `b` to the console again.

**SystemC Code:**
```c++
#include <systemc.h>

// Define the SystemC module (class)
SC_MODULE(Swapper) {
    // Declare the input signals
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;

    // Declare the output signals
    sc_out<int> out_a;
    sc_out<int> out_b;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Swapper) {
        // Set the input sensitivity for the process
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Implement the swapping algorithm
    void swap() {
        int temp = a.read();
        a.write(b.read());
        b.write(temp);
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we define a module called `Swapper` that takes two input signals `a` and `b` and two output signals `out_a` and `out_b`. In the constructor, we set the input sensitivity for the process to `a` and `b`. In the `swap` method, we implement the swapping algorithm by first assigning the value of `a` to `temp`, then assigning the value of `b` to `a`, and finally assigning the value of `temp` to `b`.

Note that the names of the signals in the SystemC code are the same as the names of the variables in the C++/C code, but with the addition of `sc_` prefix to denote that they are SystemC signals. This makes it easier to integrate the SystemC code with our existing testbench.
