  **Summary**:
The provided C++/C code is a simple program that takes a decimal number as an input and converts it to a binary number. The program uses an array to store the binary representation of the input number and then prints the binary representation in reverse order.

**Major lines/blocks of code and their functionality:**

* `int binaryNum[32];`: This is an array that is used to store the binary representation of the input number. The array is indexed from 0 to 31, which allows us to represent numbers up to 32 bits.
* `int i = 0;`: This is a counter that is used to keep track of the current index in the `binaryNum` array that we are inserting the next bit into.
* `while (n > 0)`: This loop continues until the input number is equal to 0.
* `binaryNum[i] = n % 2;`: This line inserts the least significant bit of the input number into the `binaryNum` array at index `i`. The `n % 2` operation gives us the least significant bit of `n`.
* `n = n / 2;`: This line divides the input number by 2, effectively shifting all the bits one position to the right.
* `i++;`: This line increments the counter `i` by 1, so that we can store the next bit in the next position in the `binaryNum` array.
* `cout << binaryNum[j];`: This line prints the current bit in the `binaryNum` array at index `j`.

**Inputs**:

* `int n`: The input number that the user wants to convert to binary.

**Outputs**:

* `binaryNum[]`: The binary representation of the input number, stored as an array.

**SystemC code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DecimalToBinary) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in; // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for the binary number
    
    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DecimalToBinary) {
        // Initialize the output port to 0
        binary_out.write(0);
    }
    
    // Process to convert decimal to binary
    SC_METHOD(decToBinary) {
        int n = dec_in.read();
        int i = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            binary_out.write(n % 2);
            n /= 2;
            i++;
        }
        // Print the binary representation in reverse order
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
            cout << binary_out.read();
    }
};
```
In the above code, we have defined a SystemC module named `DecimalToBinary` that contains two signals: `dec_in` and `binary_out`. The `dec_in` signal is used to receive the input decimal number, and the `binary_out` signal is used to output the converted binary number.

The module contains a constructor and a process named `decToBinary`. The constructor initializes the `binary_out` signal to 0, and the `decToBinary` process converts the input decimal number to binary and stores it in the `binary_out` signal. The process then prints the binary representation in reverse order using the `cout` statement.

In the process, we use a similar approach as the original C++/C code. We use a while loop to iterate over the input number, and inside the loop, we use the `n % 2` operation to get the least significant bit of the input number. We store this bit in the `binary_out` signal and then divide the input number by 2 using the `/=` operator. Finally, we print the binary representation in reverse order using the `cout` statement.

In the main function, we can call the `decToBinary` process by passing in the input decimal number, and the process will convert it to binary and print the result.
