  **Inputs:**

* `mat`: A two-dimensional integer array representing the matrix.
* `n`: The size of the matrix, which is passed as a parameter to the `printDiagonalSums` function.

**Outputs:**

* `principal`: The sum of the principal diagonal of the matrix.
* `secondary`: The sum of the secondary diagonal of the matrix.

**Explanation:**

The code is a simple C++ program that computes the sum of the principal and secondary diagonals of a two-dimensional integer array.

1. The code starts by including the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which provides a number of useful functions for working with integers and other data types.
2. The next line defines a constant named `MAX`, which is used to specify the maximum size of the matrix.
3. The `printDiagonalSums` function is defined, which takes a two-dimensional integer array `mat` and an integer `n` as its parameters. The function declares two integer variables `principal` and `secondary`, which will be used to store the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix.
4. The function then enters a nested `for` loop, which iterates over the elements of the matrix. The outer loop iterates over the rows of the matrix, while the inner loop iterates over the columns.
5. Inside the inner loop, the code checks if the current element is on the principal diagonal of the matrix (i.e., if `i == j`). If it is, the value of that element is added to the `principal` variable.
6. The code then checks if the current element is on the secondary diagonal of the matrix (i.e., if `(i + j) == (n - 1)`). If it is, the value of that element is added to the `secondary` variable.
7. After the inner loop completes, the code prints the sum of the principal diagonal of the matrix to the console.
8. Finally, the code prints the sum of the secondary diagonal of the matrix to the console and returns.

**SystemC code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSums) {
  sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];
  sc_out<int> principal;
  sc_out<int> secondary;

  // Constructor
  SC_CTOR(DiagonalSums) {
    SC_METHOD(computeDiagonalSums);
    sensitive << matrix;
  }

  // Method to compute the diagonal sums
  void computeDiagonalSums() {
    int principal = 0, secondary = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
        // Check if current element is on principal diagonal
        if (i == j) {
          principal += matrix[i][j];
        }
        // Check if current element is on secondary diagonal
        if ((i + j) == (SIZE - 1)) {
          secondary += matrix[i][j];
        }
      }
    }
    principal.write(principal);
    secondary.write(secondary);
  }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we declare a `DiagonalSums` module that takes a two-dimensional integer array `matrix` and outputs the sum of the principal and secondary diagonals. The `matrix` array is declared as an array of `sc_in<int>` objects, which will be connected to the input ports of the module. The `principal` and `secondary` outputs are declared as `sc_out<int>` objects.

The `computeDiagonalSums` method is defined inside the `DiagonalSums` module. This method declares two integer variables `principal` and `secondary`, which will be used to store the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals. The method then enters a nested `for` loop, which iterates over the elements of the matrix. The loop checks if the current element is on the principal or secondary diagonal, and adds its value to the appropriate sum.

After the inner loop completes, the method writes the results to the output ports of the module. The `sensitive << matrix` statement specifies that the `computeDiagonalSums` method should be called whenever the values of the `matrix` input ports change.

This SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source code, and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.
