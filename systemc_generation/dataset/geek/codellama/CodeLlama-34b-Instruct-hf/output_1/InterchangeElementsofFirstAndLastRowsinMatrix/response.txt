  Inputs:

* A 2D array of integers `m` with size `n x n`

Outputs:

* The input array `m` with the first and last columns swapped

Explanation:

The provided code is a C++ function `interchangeFirstLast` that takes as input a 2D array of integers `m` with size `n x n` and swaps the elements of the first and last columns. The function first defines two integer variables `i` and `j` initialized to 0, which will be used as indices for the loop. Then, the function enters a loop that runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of rows in the 2D array.

Inside the loop, the function defines two more integer variables `t` and `r` that will be used as temporary storage for the swapping operation. The variable `t` is set to the value of the element at the `i-th` row and `j-th` column of the 2D array `m`. Then, the variable `r` is set to the value of the element at the `i-th` row and `(n-1)-th` column of the 2D array `m`. Finally, the function swaps the values of `m[i][j]` and `m[i][n-1]` by storing the value of `m[i][n-1]` in `m[i][j]` and the value of `m[i][j]` in `m[i][n-1]`.

The function then increments the indices `i` and `j` by 1 and repeats the process until all elements of the first and last columns have been swapped.

Equivalent SystemC Code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Swapper) {
    sc_in<int> in[n][n];  // Input port for the 2D array
    sc_out<int> out[n][n];  // Output port for the swapped array

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Swapper) {
        // Process to swap the columns
        SC_METHOD(swap);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    // Method to swap the columns
    void swap() {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                out[i][j].write(in[i][(n-1)-j].read());
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `Swapper` that takes as input a 2D array of integers `in` with size `n x n` and has an output port `out` of the same size. The module contains a process `swap` that is sensitive to the input `in` and performs the swapping of the first and last columns as described above. The process loops over each row and swaps the elements of the first and last columns.
