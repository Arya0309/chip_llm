  **Inputs:**

* `original_arr`: a one-dimensional array of integers
* `len`: the length of `original_arr`

**Outputs:**

* `copied_arr`: a one-dimensional array of integers, which is a copy of `original_arr` but in reverse order

**Natural Language Summary:**

The given C++/C code defines a function `printArray` that takes an array and its length as arguments and prints the array's contents. The function `main` defines an input array `original_arr` and its length `len`. It then declares an output array `copied_arr` of the same length as `original_arr`. A `for` loop is then used to copy the elements of `original_arr` into `copied_arr` in reverse order. The function `printArray` is then called twice to print the original array and the copied array.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ReverseArray) {
    sc_in<int> original_arr[];
    sc_in<int> len;
    sc_out<int> copied_arr[];

    sc_method(copy) {
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            copied_arr[i] = original_arr[len - i - 1];
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC module, we define the input ports `original_arr` and `len`, and the output port `copied_arr`. The `copy` method copies the elements of `original_arr` into `copied_arr` in reverse order using a `for` loop, similar to the C++/C code. The method is triggered by the `len` signal to ensure that the reverse copy is performed only once.

Note that in SystemC, we use the `sc_in<int>` type to represent an input port that reads an integer value from the interface. Similarly, we use `sc_out<int>` to represent an output port that writes an integer value to the interface. The `[ ]` notation is used to represent an array of ports, which is what the C++/C code uses for its arrays.
