  **Inputs and Outputs:**

The input to the provided C++/C code is a single integer value, represented by the variable `num`. The output is the decimal equivalent of this octal value, which is calculated and stored in the variable `dec_value`.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

The code begins with a comment that describes its purpose, which is to convert an octal input to its decimal equivalent. The `iostream` library is included to provide input and output functionality. The `using namespace std` directive is used to make the standard library functions available without the need to prefix them with `std::`.

The `octalToDecimal` function is defined, which takes a single integer parameter `n` and returns an integer value. The function begins by declaring two local variables, `num` and `dec_value`, which are initialized to the input value `n` and 0, respectively.

The function then declares a local variable `base` and initializes it to 1, which represents the base value for the octal number (i.e., 8^0). The function then enters a while loop that continues while the `num` variable is non-zero.

Within the while loop, the function first extracts the last digit of the `num` variable using the modulo 10 operator, which leaves the remaining digits intact. It then divides the `num` variable by 10 to remove the last digit.

The function then multiplies the last digit by the current base value (which is initially 1) and adds it to the `dec_value` variable. Finally, it increments the base value by 8 (i.e., powers of 8) to prepare for the next iteration.

After the while loop terminates, the function returns the `dec_value` variable, which now contains the decimal equivalent of the octal input.

The `main` function is defined next, which is the entry point for the program. It declares a single local variable `num` and initializes it to the value 67. The function then calls the `octalToDecimal` function with `num` as the argument, and the result is printed to the console using the `cout` stream.

**SystemC Code:**

The following SystemC code snippet is an equivalent implementation of the provided C++/C code, using the `octal_input` and `decimal_output` signals defined above:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(OctalToDecimal) {
    sc_in<int> octal_input;
    sc_out<int> decimal_output;

    SC_CTOR(OctalToDecimal) {
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << octal_input;
    }

    void convert() {
        int num = octal_input.read();
        int dec_value = 0;
        int base = 1;

        while (num != 0) {
            int last_digit = num % 10;
            num /= 10;
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base *= 8;
        }

        decimal_output.write(dec_value);
    }
};
```
In this code, the `OctalToDecimal` module takes an `octal_input` signal and produces a `decimal_output` signal. The `convert` method is sensitive to changes in the `octal_input` signal, and it reads the input value from the signal and computes the decimal equivalent using the same logic as the original C++/C code. The resulting decimal value is then written to the `decimal_output` signal.
