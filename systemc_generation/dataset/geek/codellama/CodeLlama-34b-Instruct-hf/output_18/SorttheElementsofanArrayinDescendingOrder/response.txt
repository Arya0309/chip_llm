  Inputs:

* `nums`: an array of integers to sort
* `len`: the length of the `nums` array

Outputs:

* `nums`: the sorted array

**Line-by-line explanation:**

1. The first line includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which provides various C++ features.
2. The next line specifies the `std` namespace.
3. The `sort` function takes two parameters: `nums` (the array to sort) and `len` (the length of the array).
4. The `sort` function first initializes a boolean variable `isSwapped` to false.
5. The outer `for` loop iterates over the elements of the `nums` array, from `0` to `len-1`.
6. The inner `for` loop iterates over the elements of the `nums` array, starting from `1` and ending at `len-i-1`.
7. The inner `if` statement checks if the current element is smaller than the previous element. If it is, then the `swapNums` function is called to swap the elements.
8. If no swaps were made in the inner `for` loop, then the `break` statement is executed, which exits the loop.
9. The `swapNums` function takes three parameters: `nums` (the array to modify), `first` (the index of the first element to swap), and `second` (the index of the second element to swap).
10. The function swaps the elements at the specified indices by assigning the value of the first element to a temporary variable, assigning the value of the second element to the first element, and assigning the value of the temporary variable to the second element.

**SystemC code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Sort function
SC_MODULE(Sort) {
    sc_in<bool> clk;
    sc_in<bool> start;
    sc_out<bool> done;
    sc_in<int>  nums[];
    sc_in<int>  len;
    sc_out<int> sortedNums[];

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Sort) {
        // Signal processing
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << clk;
        on_start_ = start;
        on_done_ = done;
    }

    // Sorting method
    void sort() {
        bool isSwapped = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            isSwapped = false;
            for (int j = 1; j < len - i; j++) {
                if (nums[j] < nums[j - 1]) {
                    swapNums(nums, j, j - 1);
                    isSwapped = true;
                }
            }
            if (!isSwapped) {
                break;
            }
        }
        done.write(true);
    }

    // Swap two elements in the array
    void swapNums(int nums[], int first, int second) {
        int temp = nums[first];
        nums[first] = nums[second];
        nums[second] = temp;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we've defined a `Sort` module that takes five ports:

* `clk`: a clock signal to control the sorting process
* `start`: a signal to start the sorting process
* `done`: a signal to indicate when the sorting is complete
* `nums`: an array of integers to sort
* `len`: the length of the `nums` array
* `sortedNums`: an array of integers that will hold the sorted values

The `Sort` module contains a `sort` method that implements the bubble sort algorithm. The `sort` method takes no parameters, and it runs continuously when the `clk` signal is high. When the `start` signal is asserted, the `sort` method initializes the `isSwapped` variable to `false` and enters the outer `for` loop.

The outer `for` loop iterates over the elements of the `nums` array, from `0` to `len-1`. The inner `for` loop iterates over the elements of the `nums` array, starting from `1` and ending at `len-i-1`. If the current element is smaller than the previous element, the `swapNums` function is called to swap the elements. If no swaps were made in the inner `for` loop, the `break` statement is executed, which exits the loops.

The `swapNums` function takes three parameters: `nums` (the array to modify), `first` (the index of the first element to swap), and `second` (the index of the second element to swap). The function swaps the elements at the specified indices by assigning the value of the first element to a temporary variable, assigning the value of the second element to the first element, and assigning the value of the temporary variable to the second element.

The `Sort` module also contains a `swapNums` method that implements the same logic as the `swapNums` function in the original C++ code.

In summary, the SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source, and it can be integrated into a high-level synthesis flow that uses the provided signals (or equivalent named ports) to control the sorting process.
