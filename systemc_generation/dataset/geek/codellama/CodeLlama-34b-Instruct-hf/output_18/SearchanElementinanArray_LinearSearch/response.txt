Line-by-Line Explanation:

* `int linearSearch(vector<int> v, int key) {` - Declares a function named `linearSearch` that takes two parameters: `v`, a vector of integers, and `key`, an integer. The function returns an integer.
* `// We test all the elements of the vector` - Comment describing the purpose of the for loop.
* `for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {` - A for loop that starts at the first index of the vector and increments until the last index.
* `// If the KEY IS FOUND` - Comment describing the purpose of the if statement.
* `if (v[i] == key) {` - If the value at the current index is equal to the search key, then return the index.
* `return i;` - Return the current index.
* `return -1;` - If the value at the current index is not equal to the search key, then return a value indicating the key was not found.
* `int main() {` - Beginning of the main function.
* `vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};` - Declare a variable named `v` and initialize it with a vector of integers.
* `int key = 8;` - Declare a variable named `key` and initialize it with an integer value.
* `// Searching the key in the vector v` - Comment describing the purpose of the next statement.
* `int i = linearSearch(v, key);` - Call the `linearSearch` function and store the result in a variable named `i`.
* `// Checking if element is found or not` - Comment describing the purpose of the next statement.
* `if (i != -1) {` - If `i` is not equal to the value indicating the key was not found, then the key was found.
* `cout << key << " Found at Position: " <<` - Print the search key and the position it was found at.
* `i + 1;` - Add 1 to the current position and print it.
* `else` - If the key was not found.
* `cout << key << " NOT found.";` - Print the search key and a message indicating it was not found.
* `return 0;` - Return a value indicating successful execution.

SystemC Code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LinearSearch) {
    sc_in<int> key;
    sc_out<int> index;
    sc_vector<sc_in<int> > data;

    void linearSearch() {
        for (int i = 0; i < data.size(); i++) {
            if (data[i] == key) {
                index.write(i);
                return;
            }
        }
        index.write(-1);
    }

    SC_CTOR(LinearSearch) {
        SC_METHOD(linearSearch);
        sensitive << key << data;
    }
};
```
Note: The SystemC code utilizes the signals `key`, `index`, and `data`, as declared in the provided signals. The `LinearSearch` module implements the linear search algorithm specified in the C++/C code. The `linearSearch` method performs the search by iterating over the elements of the `data` vector and returning the index of the searched key if found, otherwise, it returns `-1`. The `sensitive` block specifies that the `linearSearch` method should be sensitive to changes in the `key` and `data` signals. The `SC_CTOR` macro creates an instance of the `LinearSearch` module.
