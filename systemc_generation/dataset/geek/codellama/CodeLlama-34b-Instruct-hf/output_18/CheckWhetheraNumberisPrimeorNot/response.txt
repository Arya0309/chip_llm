  **Inputs:**

* `n`: an integer value representing the number under consideration for primality.
* `is_prime`: a Boolean output signal indicating whether `n` is prime or not.

**Outputs:**

* `is_prime`: a Boolean output signal indicating whether `n` is prime or not.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code implements a simple primality test algorithm using trial division. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Accept an integer input `n`.
2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, and the function outputs `is_prime = false`.
3. Otherwise, the algorithm checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using a loop.
4. For each iteration of the loop, the algorithm checks if `n` is divisible by the current loop variable `i` using the modulo operator (`%`).
5. If `n` is divisible by at least one number from 1 to `n`, the algorithm increments a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of divisible numbers.
6. If `cnt` is greater than 2, the algorithm outputs `is_prime = false`, indicating that `n` is not prime.
7. Otherwise, if `cnt` is equal to 2, the algorithm outputs `is_prime = true`, indicating that `n` is prime.

**SystemC Code:**

Here is a SystemC code snippet that captures the logic of the C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<bool> is_prime;

    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        SC_THREAD(check_prime);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    void check_prime() {
        int cnt = 0;
        if (n <= 1) {
            is_prime.write(false);
        } else {
            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                if (n % i == 0) {
                    cnt++;
                }
            }
            is_prime.write(cnt > 2 ? false : true);
        }
    }
};
```
In this implementation, we have defined a `PrimeChecker` module that takes an integer input `n` and provides a Boolean output `is_prime`. The module contains a `check_prime` thread that implements the simple primality test algorithm using trial division.

The `check_prime` thread first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, and if so, it outputs `is_prime = false`. Otherwise, it sets up a `cnt` variable to keep track of the number of divisible numbers, and enters a loop that checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 1 to `n`.

For each iteration of the loop, the algorithm checks if `n` is divisible by the current loop variable `i` using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is divisible by at least one number from 1 to `n`, the algorithm increments `cnt`.

After the loop, the algorithm checks if `cnt` is greater than 2, and if so, it outputs `is_prime = false`. Otherwise, it outputs `is_prime = true`, indicating that `n` is prime.

Note that we have used the same inputs and outputs as the original C++/C code, and the SystemC code captures the same logic as the C++/C code.
