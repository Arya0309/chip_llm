  **Inputs**:

* The input is an integer value in octal format, represented by the signal `octal_input`.
* The input value is passed to the function `octalToDecimal` as an argument.

**Outputs**:

* The output is an integer value in decimal format, represented by the signal `decimal_output`.
* The output value is returned by the function `octalToDecimal` and printed to the console using `std::cout`.

**Detailed Explanation**:

1. `octal_input` is declared as an `sc_in<int>` signal, which means it is an input signal that can be read by the SystemC model.
2. The function `octalToDecimal` is defined to convert an octal number to its decimal equivalent. It takes an `int` type argument `n` representing the octal number.
3. Inside the function, the input `n` is stored in a local variable `num` for further processing.
4. The function initializes a temporary variable `dec_value` to store the decimal equivalent of the octal number.
5. The function also initializes a base value for the conversion process, which is set to 1, which represents 8^0.
6. The function then extracts the last digit of the octal number using the remainder operator (`% 10`).
7. The function then divides the octal number by 10 using integer division, and stores the result in a temporary variable `temp`.
8. The function then multiplies the last digit of the octal number with the base value, and adds it to `dec_value`.
9. The function then increments the base value by 8, and repeats the process until the temporary variable `temp` becomes 0.
10. The function returns the `dec_value` as the decimal equivalent of the octal number.

**SystemC Code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(OctalToDecimal) {
  sc_in<int> octal_input;
  sc_out<int> decimal_output;

  void octalToDecimal() {
    int num = octal_input.read();
    int dec_value = 0;
    int base = 1;
    int temp = num;

    while (temp != 0) {
      int last_digit = temp % 10;
      temp = temp / 10;
      dec_value += last_digit * base;
      base = base * 8;
    }

    decimal_output.write(dec_value);
  }
};
```
The SystemC code has the following blocks:

1. The `OctalToDecimal` module has an `sc_in<int>` signal `octal_input` to read the octal number, and an `sc_out<int>` signal `decimal_output` to write the decimal equivalent.
2. The `octalToDecimal` function reads the octal number from the `octal_input` signal, and stores it in a local variable `num`.
3. The function then initializes the decimal equivalent of the octal number to 0, and the base value to 1.
4. The function then extracts the last digit of the octal number using the remainder operator (`% 10`), and stores it in a temporary variable `last_digit`.
5. The function then divides the octal number by 10 using integer division, and stores the result in a temporary variable `temp`.
6. The function then multiplies the last digit of the octal number with the base value, and adds it to the `dec_value`.
7. The function then increments the base value by 8, and repeats the process until the temporary variable `temp` becomes 0.
8. The function writes the `dec_value` to the `decimal_output` signal.

Note that the SystemC code uses the signals defined in the provided code, `octal_input` and `decimal_output`, to capture the logic of the original C++/C source code.
