  **Inputs:**

* `original_arr`: The input array of integers to be copied in reverse order.
* `len`: The length of the input array.

**Outputs:**

* `copied_arr`: The output array that contains the elements of the input array in reverse order.

**Line-by-Line Summary:**

1. `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the header file that declares the functions for performing input/output operations.
2. `// Function to print the array`: This is a comment that explains the purpose of the following function.
3. `void printArray(int arr[], int len)`: This is a function that takes an array and its length as inputs and prints its contents on the screen in a space-separated manner.
4. `{`: This marks the beginning of the function definition.
5. `int i;`: This line declares a variable `i` of type `int` and initializes it to 0.
6. `for (i = 0; i < len; i++)`: This is a for loop that iterates over the elements of the array. The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
7. `printf("%d ", arr[i]);`: This line prints the value of the `i`th element of the array followed by a space.
8. `}`: This marks the end of the function definition.
9. `// Driver code`: This is a comment that explains the purpose of the following code.
10. `int main()`: This line declares a function named `main` that has no input arguments and returns an integer value.
11. `{`: This marks the beginning of the function definition.
12. `int original_arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`: This line declares an array named `original_arr` and initializes it with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
13. `int len = sizeof(original_arr)/sizeof(original_arr[0]);`: This line calculates the length of the `original_arr` array and stores it in a variable named `len`.
14. `int copied_arr[len], i, j;`: This line declares three variables: `copied_arr` which is an array of integers of length `len`, `i` which is an integer variable initialized to 0, and `j` which is an integer variable initialized to 0.
15. `for (i = 0; i < len; i++)`: This is a for loop that iterates over the elements of the `original_arr` array. The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
16. `copied_arr[i] = original_arr[len - i - 1];`: This line copies the value of the `i`th element of the `original_arr` array to the `i`th element of the `copied_arr` array in reverse order.
17. `printf(" Original array: ");`: This line prints a string "Original array: " followed by a space on the screen.
18. `printArray(original_arr, len);`: This line calls the `printArray` function and passes the `original_arr` array and its length `len` as arguments.
19. `printf(" Resultant array: ");`: This line prints a string "Resultant array: " followed by a space on the screen.
20. `printArray(copied_arr, len);`: This line calls the `printArray` function and passes the `copied_arr` array and its length `len` as arguments.
21. `return 0;`: This line returns the value 0 from the `main` function.
22. `}`: This marks the end of the function definition.

**SystemC Code:**

* The SystemC code for the above C program can be written as follows:

```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ReverseArray) {
    sc_in<sc_uint<32>> original_arr;
    sc_in<sc_uint<32>> len;
    sc_out<sc_uint<32>> copied_arr;

    SC_CTOR(ReverseArray) {
        SC_METHOD(reverse);
        sensitive << original_arr;
    }

    void reverse() {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            copied_arr.write(original_arr.read()[len - i - 1]);
        }
    }
};
```

In the above code, we have defined a module named `ReverseArray` that takes three inputs: `original_arr`, `len`, and `copied_arr`. The `original_arr` input is an array of 32-bit unsigned integers, and the `len` input is a 32-bit unsigned integer that represents the length of the `original_arr` array. The `copied_arr` output is also an array of 32-bit unsigned integers, and it represents the result of reversing the elements of the `original_arr` array in reverse order.

The `reverse` method is defined inside the `ReverseArray` module, and it takes no inputs or outputs. It simply reverses the elements of the `original_arr` array and writes the result to the `copied_arr` array. The `reverse` method is sensitive to the `original_arr` input, which means that it is executed whenever the value of the `original_arr` input changes.

** Important notes:

* In the SystemC code, we have used the `sc_uint<32>` data type to represent the 32-bit unsigned integers in the `original_arr` and `copied_arr` arrays.
* In the `reverse` method, we have used the `write` method to write the result of reversing the elements of the `original_arr` array to the `copied_arr` array.
* The `len` input is used to determine the length of the `original_arr` array, and it is used in the `reverse` method to iterate over the elements of the array.
