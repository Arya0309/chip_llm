  **Inputs:**

* `principal`: The original principal amount.
* `rate`: The annual interest rate.
* `time`: The time period for which the interest is applied.

**Outputs:**

* `CI`: The compound interest after `time` years.

**C++/C Code Summary:**

The provided code defines a `main` function that takes in three input values: `principal`, `rate`, and `time`. It then calculates the compound interest using the formula:

A = P \* (1 + r/100)^t

where P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, and t is the time period. The code then calculates the compound interest by subtracting the principal from the computed value of A. Finally, the code prints the compound interest to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that computes compound interest
SC_MODULE(CompoundInterest) {
    sc_in<double> principal;   // Input port for principal amount
    sc_in<double> rate;        // Input port for annual interest rate
    sc_in<double> time;        // Input port for time period
    sc_out<double> ci;         // Output port for compound interest

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterest) {
        // Process to compute compound interest
        SC_METHOD(compute);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to compute compound interest
    void compute() {
        double A = principal * pow(1 + (rate / 100.0), time);
        ci = A - principal;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC module, we define three input ports to receive the `principal`, `rate`, and `time` values. We also define an output port to send the computed compound interest value.

The constructor initializes a process that is sensitive to changes in any of the input ports. Whenever any of the input ports changes, the `compute` method is triggered.

The `compute` method uses the same formula as the original C++/C code to compute the compound interest. It stores the result in the output port `ci`.

Note that we have used `double` as the data type for all signals to match the original code. Also, we have included the necessary headers and `using` directives to make the code compilable.
