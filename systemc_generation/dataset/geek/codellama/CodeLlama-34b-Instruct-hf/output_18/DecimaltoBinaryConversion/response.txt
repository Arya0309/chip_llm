  **Inputs:**

* `n`: The decimal number to be converted to binary.

**Outputs:**

* `binaryNum`: The binary representation of `n`.

**Code Summary:**

The provided code defines a function `decToBinary(int n)` that takes a decimal number `n` as input and converts it to a binary number. The function does this by first initializing an array `binaryNum` of length 32 to store the binary representation of `n`. The function then uses a loop to repeatedly divide `n` by 2 and store the remainder in the `binaryNum` array. Once the loop is finished, the function prints the `binaryNum` array in reverse order, which corresponds to the binary representation of `n`.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DecToBinary) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for the decimal number to be converted
    sc_out<int> binary_out;  // Output port for the binary representation

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DecToBinary) {
        // Process to perform conversion
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    // Method to convert the decimal number to binary
    void convert() {
        int n = dec_in.read(); // Read the decimal number from the input port
        int binaryNum[32]; // Array to store the binary representation

        // Loop to divide the decimal number by 2 and store the remainder in the binary array
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
        }

        // Output the binary representation
        for (int j = 0; j < 32; j++) {
            binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
        }
    }
};
```
In the above SystemC code, we define a module `DecToBinary` that takes a decimal number as input and produces its binary representation as output. The module consists of two input and output ports: `dec_in` and `binary_out`, respectively. The constructor initializes a process to perform the conversion, which is defined in the `convert()` method. The method reads the decimal number from the `dec_in` port, divides it by 2 repeatedly to get the binary representation, and outputs the binary representation to the `binary_out` port.

Note that the code assumes that the input decimal number is less than or equal to 31, which is the maximum number that can be represented using a 32-bit binary number. If the input decimal number is greater than 31, the code will produce incorrect results.
