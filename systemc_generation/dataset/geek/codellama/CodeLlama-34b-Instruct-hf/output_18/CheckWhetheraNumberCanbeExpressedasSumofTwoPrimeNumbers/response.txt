  **Inputs**:

* `n_in`: An integer input that represents the number to be checked if it can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

**Output**:

* `result_out`: A boolean output that indicates whether the input number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

**Line-by-Line Explanation**:

The given C++ code defines two functions: `isPrime` and `isPossible`.

1. `isPrime`: This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number or not. It uses a simple prime number checking algorithm, which first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, and if not, it checks if `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n`. If `n` is found to be divisible, the function returns false, otherwise it returns true.
2. `isPossible`: This function takes an integer `N` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `N` can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. It first checks if `N` is a prime number and the number `N-2` is also a prime number. If both conditions are true, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.

The `main` function is the driver code that tests the functionality of the two functions. It first defines an integer `n` with the value 13, which is a prime number that can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers (5 and 8). The `isPossible` function is called with the input `n`, and the result is printed to the console.

**SystemC Code**:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks if an integer can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers
SC_MODULE(PrimeSum) {
    sc_in<int> n_in;  // Input port for the integer to be checked
    sc_out<bool> result_out;  // Output port for the result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PrimeSum) {
        // Process to perform the check
        SC_METHOD(check);
        sensitive << n_in;
    }

    // Method to perform the check
    void check() {
        int n = n_in.read();
        bool is_prime = isPrime(n);
        bool is_prime_sum = isPossible(n);
        result_out.write(is_prime && is_prime_sum);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, I have defined a module called `PrimeSum` that contains an input port `n_in` for the integer to be checked, and an output port `result_out` for the result. The constructor initializes a process `check` that is sensitive to the input port `n_in`.

The `check` method reads the input integer `n` from the input port `n_in`, checks if `n` is a prime number using the `isPrime` function, and checks if `n` can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers using the `isPossible` function. If both conditions are true, the method writes the output `true` to the output port `result_out`, otherwise it writes `false`.

The SystemC code uses the same logic as the original C++ code, but it is structured as a process-based module with input and output ports, making it more amenable to high-level synthesis.
