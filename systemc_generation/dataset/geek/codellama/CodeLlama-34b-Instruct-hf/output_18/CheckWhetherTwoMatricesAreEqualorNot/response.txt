  The given C++ program has a single function `areSame(int A[][N], int B[] [N])` that takes two matrices A and B as arguments, compares them, and returns 1 if they are identical. If they aren't, this function returns 0.

The program begins with a set of inputs. The size of this matrix, N, is defined as 4. Using the parameterized macro provided by the CPreProcessor library, N is assigned the value `4`. The program then defines the input matrices A and B as `int A[N][N]` and `int B[N] X]N],` respectively.

In the `main()` function, A and B are assigned known values that happen to be identical. The `areSame()` function is called with A and B as parameters, and its return value is printed to the screen if they are the same, and not the same otherwise.

The `areSame()` algorithm iterates through each element of A and B using for loops. If any pair of elements is different, it immediately returns 0. If A and B are fully traversed without returning, they are technically the same  matrix, and this function returns 1.

The following SystemC code faithfully reflects the logic of the original C++ code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that compares two integers
SC_MODULE( Comparer ) {
    sc_in<int> A[SIZE];
    sc_in<int> B[SIZE];
    sc_out<bool> identical;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR( Comparer ) {
        // Process to compare the two matrices
        SC_METHOD( Compare );
        sensitive << A << B;
    }

    void compare() {
        identical.write(areSame(A, B));
    }
};
```

In the above code, we leverage the `SC_METHOD()` primitive to create a function \begin{code}
void compare() {
identical.write(areSame(A, B));
}
\end{code} which writes the return value of the `areSame()` function to the output `identical`. The `areSame()` function is called with `A` and `B` as parameters.

We also create an input port for each array `A` and `B` using `sc_in<int> A[SIZE]`. Finally, we create an output port `identical` of type `sc_out<bool>`.
