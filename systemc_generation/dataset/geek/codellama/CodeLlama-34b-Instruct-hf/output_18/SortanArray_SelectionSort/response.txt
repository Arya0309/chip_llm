  **Inputs:**

* `arr`: An array of integers to be sorted.
* `n`: The length of the array.

**Outputs:**

* `arr`: The sorted array.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code implements the selection sort algorithm, which is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning of the array.

The code contains several functions:

* `swap`: A function that swaps two integers.
* `selectionSort`: The main function that implements the selection sort algorithm. It takes the array `arr` and its length `n` as input, and sorts the array in place.
* `printArray`: A function that prints the contents of an array.

The `main` function is the driver program that calls the `selectionSort` function to sort an array of integers.

**SystemC Code:**

Here is an equivalent SystemC code that implements the selection sort algorithm:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to implement selection sort
SC_MODULE(SelectionSort) {
    // Input port for the array to be sorted
    sc_in<int> arr[];
    // Input port for the length of the array
    sc_in<int> n;
    // Output port for the sorted array
    sc_out<int> sorted[];

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SelectionSort) {
        // Process to perform selection sort
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << arr << n;
    }

    // Method to perform selection sort
    void sort() {
        // Loop through the unsorted part of the array
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            // Find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array
            int minIndex = i;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
                    minIndex = j;
                }
            }

            // Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part of the array
            if (minIndex != i) {
                int temp = sorted[i];
                sorted[i] = arr[minIndex];
                sorted[minIndex] = temp;
            }
        }

        // Set the output port with the sorted array
        sorted.write(sorted);
    }
};
```
The SystemC code takes the same inputs and outputs as the C++/C code, and utilizes the `sc_in`, `sc_out`, and `sc_clock` ports defined in the testbench code snippet. The `SelectionSort` module has a `sort` method that performs the selection sort algorithm on the input array, and sets the output port with the sorted array. The `printArray` function is not needed in SystemC, since the output can be directly written to the output port.
