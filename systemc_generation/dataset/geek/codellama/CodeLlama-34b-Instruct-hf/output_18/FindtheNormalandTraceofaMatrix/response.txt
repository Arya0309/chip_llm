  Inputs:

* `mat` - a two-dimensional integer array representing the matrix for which the trace and normal need to be calculated.
* `n` - an integer representing the size of the matrix.

Outputs:

* `trace` - an integer representing the trace of the matrix.
* `norm` - an integer representing the normal of the matrix.

Line-by-line explanation:

1. The program starts with a `const` variable `MAX` which is set to the maximum size of the matrix.
2. The `findTrace` function is defined, which takes an integer array `mat` and a size parameter `n` as input. It returns the trace of the matrix.
	* A variable `sum` is declared and initialized to 0.
	* A nested loop is implemented, which iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix.
	* In each iteration, the element at the current row and column is added to the `sum` variable.
	* The `sum` variable is returned as the trace of the matrix.
3. The `findNormal` function is defined, which takes an integer array `mat` and a size parameter `n` as input. It returns the normal of the matrix.
	* A variable `sum` is declared and initialized to 0.
	* A nested loop is implemented, which iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix.
	* In each iteration, the element at the current row and column is squared and added to the `sum` variable.
	* The `sum` variable is returned as the normal of the matrix.
4. The `main` function is defined, which is the driver code that calls the `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions.
	* A two-dimensional array `mat` is defined and initialized to a 5x5 matrix.
	* The `findTrace` function is called with `mat` and the size 5 as arguments, and the result is printed to the console.
	* The `findNormal` function is called with `mat` and the size 5 as arguments, and the result is printed to the console.

SystemC Code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Matrix) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];
    sc_out<int> trace;
    sc_out<int> norm;
    
    void findTrace();
    void findNormal();

    SC_CTOR(Matrix) {
        findTrace();
        findNormal();
    }

private:
    // constants
    const int MAX = 100;

    int findTrace(int mat[][MAX], int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                sum += mat[i][j];
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }

    int findNormal(int mat[][MAX], int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                sum += mat[i][j] * mat[i][j];
            }
        }
        return sqrt(sum);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `Matrix` module has three ports: `matrix` is an array of input signals, `trace` is an output signal, and `norm` is another output signal. The `Matrix` module has two private member functions, `findTrace` and `findNormal`, which are used to calculate the trace and normal of the matrix, respectively. In the constructor of the `Matrix` module, the `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions are called to calculate the trace and normal of the matrix. The results are then assigned to the `trace` and `norm` output signals.
