  **Inputs:**

* `dec_in`: The decimal input value to be converted to binary.

**Outputs:**

* `binary_out`: The binary output value corresponding to the input decimal number.

**Summary:**

The given C++/C code defines a function `decToBinary` that takes a decimal input `n` and converts it to a binary number. The function first declares an integer array `binaryNum` to store the binary representation of the decimal number. The function then iterates through the decimal number using a `while` loop, and for each iteration, it stores the remainder of the number divided by 2 in the `binaryNum` array. The loop continues until the number becomes 0. Finally, the function prints the binary representation of the number in reverse order using a `for` loop.

**Equivalent SystemC Code:**

Here is an equivalent SystemC code that implements the same logic as the given C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DecimalToBinary) {
  sc_in<int> dec_in;
  sc_out<int> binary_out;

  void decToBinary() {
    int n = dec_in.read();
    sc_int<32> binaryNum;
    int i = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
      binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
      n /= 2;
      i++;
    }
    for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
      binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
    }
  }
};
```
In this code, we have defined a SystemC module `DecimalToBinary` that contains the input `dec_in` and output `binary_out` signals. The `decToBinary` method is responsible for converting the decimal input to a binary output.

The method first reads the input decimal value from the `dec_in` signal and stores it in a local variable `n`. It then declares an integer array `binaryNum` to store the binary representation of the decimal number.

The method then iterates through the decimal number using a `while` loop, and for each iteration, it stores the remainder of the number divided by 2 in the `binaryNum` array. The loop continues until the number becomes 0.

Finally, the method prints the binary representation of the number in reverse order using a `for` loop. The binary output is written to the `binary_out` signal.

Note that in the SystemC code, we have used a `sc_int<32>` signal to represent the binary number, which is a 32-bit integer signal. This is because the binary representation of a decimal number can be represented using a maximum of 32 bits.

Also, we have used the `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals to represent the input and output signals, respectively. These signals are defined in the `systemc.h` header file and are used to connect signals to input and output ports of SystemC modules.
