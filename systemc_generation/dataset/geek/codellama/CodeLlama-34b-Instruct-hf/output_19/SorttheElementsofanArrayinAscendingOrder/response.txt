  **Inputs and Outputs**

* Inputs:
	+ `num`: Array of integers to be sorted
	+ `size_nums`: Size of the `nums` array
* Outputs:
	+ `nums`: Sorted array

**Summary**

The provided C++ code defines a `sort` function that takes an array of integers and its size as input and returns a sorted array of the same size. The `sort` function uses a bubble sort algorithm to sort the array. The main function initializes an array of integers and passes it to the `sort` function, which sorts the array.

The code can be summarized as follows:

1. The `sort` function takes an array of integers and its size as input and initializes two variables: `isSwapped` and `j`.
2. The `isSwapped` variable is used as a flag to indicate whether the elements in the array have been swapped. It is initialized to `false`.
3. The `j` variable is used as a loop counter to iterate over the array. It is initialized to 1 to start the loop from the second element (index 1).
4. The loop iterates over the array using the `j` variable and checks if the next element is smaller than the current element. If the next element is smaller, it swaps the elements and sets `isSwapped` to `true`.
5. After the first iteration, the largest element in the array is at the last index.
6. The function repeats step 4 for the remaining elements in the array, until the entire array is sorted.
7. The `sort` function returns the sorted array.
8. The `main` function initializes an array of integers and passes it to the `sort` function to sort the array.
9. The sorted array is printed on the console.

**SystemC Code**
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that sorts an array of integers
SC_MODULE(Sorter) {
    sc_in<int> num;  // Input port for unsorted array
    sc_in<int> size_nums;  // Input port for size of array
    sc_out<int> sorted_nums;  // Output port for sorted array

    // Function to sort array
    void sort(int num[], int size_nums) {
        bool is_swapped;
        int j;

        // Loop over the array
        for (int i = 0; i < size_nums; i++) {
            is_swapped = false;
            for (j = 1; j < size_nums - i; j++) {
                if (num[j] < num[j-1]) {
                    SC_SWAP(num[j], num[j-1]);
                    is_swapped = true;
                }
            }
            if (!is_swapped) { break; }
        }
    }

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Sorter) {
        SC_THREAD(sort);
        sensitive << num << size_nums;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `Sorter` that has three ports: `num`, `size_nums`, and `sorted_nums`. The `num` port is used to input an unsorted array of integers, while the `size_nums` port is used to input the size of the array. The `sorted_nums` port is used to output the sorted array.

The `sort` function is defined within the `Sorter` module. It takes an array of integers and its size as input and sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm. The function uses two loops to iterate over the array and swap elements if necessary. The `is_swapped` variable is used as a flag to indicate whether the elements in the array have been swapped.

The `Sorter` module has a constructor that defines a thread called `sort` and makes it sensitive to the `num` and `size_nums` ports. This means that whenever the `num` and `size_nums` ports change, the `sort` thread will be triggered to run the `sort` function.

To use the `Sorter` module in a high-level synthesis flow, it can be instantiated and connected to the other SystemC components, such as the clock, start, and done signals. The sorted array will be available on the `sorted_nums` port after the `sort` function completes.
