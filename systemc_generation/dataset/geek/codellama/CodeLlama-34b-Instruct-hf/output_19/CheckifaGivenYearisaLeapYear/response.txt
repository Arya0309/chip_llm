  **Inputs and Outputs**

Inputs:

* `year`: an integer value representing the year to be checked for leap year status.

Outputs:

* `is_leap_year`: a boolean value indicating whether the input year is a leap year or not.

**Summary**

The provided C++/C code defines a function `checkYear` that takes an integer `year` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input year is a leap year or not. The function checks whether the year is divisible by 400, 100, or 4, and based on that, it determines whether the year is a leap year or not. The function is called in the `main` function with the input year of 2000, and the result is printed to the console.

**SystemC Code**

Based on the provided C++/C code, the following SystemC code implements the same logic:
```scss
SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    sc_in<int> year;
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;

    SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
        SC_METHOD(checkYear);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    void checkYear() {
        if (year % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year % 100 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        } else if (year % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `LeapYearChecker` with two ports: `year` and `is_leap_year`. The `year` port is an input port that takes an integer value representing the year to be checked for leap year status. The `is_leap_year` port is an output port that returns a boolean value indicating whether the input year is a leap year or not.

The `SC_CTOR` method is used to construct the module and specify the `year` port as the sensitive signal. This means that when the `year` input changes, the `checkYear` method will be called.

The `checkYear` method implements the same logic as the `checkYear` function in the C++/C code. It checks whether the year is divisible by 400, 100, or 4, and based on that, it determines whether the year is a leap year or not. The result is written to the `is_leap_year` port.

Note that the `sc_out` module provides a `write` method that allows us to assign a value to a port. Similarly, the `sc_in` module provides a `read` method that allows us to read the value from a port.

In summary, this SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source and provides the required inputs/outputs for testbench integration.
