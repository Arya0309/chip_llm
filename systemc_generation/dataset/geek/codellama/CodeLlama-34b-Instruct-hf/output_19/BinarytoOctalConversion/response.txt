  Providing Extensive Explanations without hassle  
The code provided examples a C++ program to convert octal to decimal. The main function first declares an integer variable num and assigns 67 to it. Then, it calls the octalToDecimal function and passes num as an argument. Inside the octalToDecimal function, another integer variable num is declared and assigned the value of the argument passed.   
The function then declares two more variables, dec_val, and base, and assigns them initial values of 0 and 1, respectively. The function extracts the last digit of num and stores it in a variable called last_digit. It then divides num by 10 and subtracts the result from num. Next, it multiplies last_digit by base and adds it to dec_val. Finally, it multiplies base by 8 and assigns the result to base. It repeats these steps until the value of num is 0.
Back in the main function, the code calls cout to display the return value of the octalToDecimal function, which is an integer value representing the decimal equivalent of the input octal number.


**SystemC Code:**

```
SC_MODULE(OctalToDecimal) {
    sc_in<int> octal_input;   // Input port for octal number
    sc_out<int> decimal_output;  // Output port for decimal number

    // Function to convert octal to decimal
    void octalToDecimal() {
        int num = octal_input.read();
        int dec_val = 0;
        int base = 1;
        int temp = num;
        while (temp) {
            // Extracting last digit
            int last_digit = temp % 10;
            temp = temp / 10;
            // Multiplying last digit with appropriate base value and adding 
            // it to dec_val
            dec_val += last_digit * base;
            base = base * 8;
        }
        decimal_output.write(dec_val); // Write output to decimal_output port
    }

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(OctalToDecimal) {
        // Method to perform decimal conversion
        SC_METHOD(octalToDecimal)
        sensitive << octal_input;
    }
};

```

In this SystemC code, we defined a module called OctalToDecima which has two ports, octal_input and decimal_output. The OctalToDecimal function first reads the input octal number from the octal_input port using the read() method. It then initializes two more variables, dec_val and base, and assigns them initial values of 0 and 1, respectively. It extracts the last digit of num and stores it in a variable called last_digit. It then divides num by 10 and subtracts the result from num. Next, it multiplies last_digit by base and adds it to dec_val. Finally, it multiplies base by 8 and assigns the result to base.  
It repeats these steps until the value of num is 0. It then writes the output, which is the decimal equivalent of the input octal number into the decimal_output port using the write() method. The constructor of the module creates a process called octalToDecimal which calls the OctalToDecimal function whenever the octal_input port receives an input. The process is sensitive to the octal_input port, meaning it will execute every time a new input value is received.
