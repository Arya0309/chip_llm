  **Inputs:**

* `mat1[][C1]`: A two-dimensional array representing the first matrix
* `mat2[][C2]`: A two-dimensional array representing the second matrix
* `C1`: Number of columns in the first matrix
* `C2`: Number of columns in the second matrix
* `R1`: Number of rows in the first matrix
* `R2`: Number of rows in the second matrix

**Outputs:**

* `rslt[][C2]`: A two-dimensional array representing the result of the matrix multiplication

**Summary:**

The code calculates the product of two matrices (mat1 and mat2) and displays the result in a tabular format. The function `mulMat` takes two two-dimensional arrays `mat1` and `mat2` as input and multiplies them element-wise, storing the result in a third two-dimensional array `rslt`. The matrix multiplication is performed using the following formula:

`rslt[i][j] = mat1[i][k] * mat2[k][j]`

where `i` and `j` represent the row and column indices of the matrix `rslt`, respectively, and `k` represents the common dimension between `mat1` and `mat2`.

The code consists of the following blocks:

1. Initialization: The matrices `mat1` and `mat2` are initialized, and the number of rows and columns are determined.
2. Checking for compatible dimensions: The function checks if the number of columns in `mat1` is equal to the number of rows in `mat2`, which is a necessary condition for matrix multiplication. If the condition is not met, the function exits with an error message.
3. Matrix multiplication: The function declares a third matrix `rslt`, which will store the result of the matrix multiplication. The `rslt` matrix is initialized to zero, and then the function uses nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns of `mat1` and `mat2`, respectively, and performs the matrix multiplication using the formula mentioned above.
4. Displaying results: The function displays the result of the matrix multiplication in a tabular format.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixMultiply) {
    sc_in<sc_int<32>> A[SIZE_A];
    sc_in<sc_int<32>> B[SIZE_B];
    sc_out<sc_int<32>> C[SIZE_RESULT];

    SC_CTOR(MatrixMultiply) {
        SC_METHOD(multiply);
        sensitive << A << B;
    }

    void multiply() {
        sc_int<32> rslt[R1][C2];
        for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                rslt[i][j] = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < R2; k++) {
                    rslt[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
                }
            }
        }
        C.write(rslt);
    }
};
```
In the above SystemC code, the input and output signals are declared as `A`, `B`, and `C`, respectively, which are two-dimensional arrays. The `MatrixMultiply` module takes the two input matrices as inputs and outputs the result array. The `multiply` method performs the matrix multiplication using the same nested loops as in the original code and writes the result to the `C` output port.

Note that the `sc_int` type is used to represent the data in the `A`, `B`, and `C` arrays. This is necessary because SystemC requires that all signals have a specific data type, and the `sc_int` type is the most flexible and conventional choice for integers.
