  **Inputs:**

* `a` and `b`: Integers to be used in the calculation of the greatest common divisor (GCD).

**Outputs:**

* `gcd_result`: Integer representing the GCD of `a` and `b`.

**C++/C Source Code Summary:**

The provided C++/C source code defines a function, `gcd()`, that takes two integers, `a` and `b`, as inputs and returns an integer representing the GCD of these two numbers.

The `gcd()` function first determines the minimum of `a` and `b` using the `min()` function from the `std` namespace. It then enters a loop that starts with the minimum and decreases the value by 1 on each iteration until it finds a common divisor for both `a` and `b`.

The loop continues until it reaches 1, at which point the `res` variable is returned as the GCD of `a` and `b`.

In the `main()` function, the `gcd()` function is called with the user-defined input values and the result is printed to the console.

**SystemC Snippet:**

Below is a SystemC module that incorporates the same logic as the provided C++/C source code. The module, `GCD`, takes two input ports, `a` and `b`, and one output port, `gcd_result`.

The `SC_METHOD` block defines a method, `calculate_gcd`, that first calls the `std::min()` function to determine the minimum of `a` and `b`. It then enters a loop that starts with the minimum and decreases the value by 1 on each iteration until it finds a common divisor for both `a` and `b`.

The loop continues until it reaches 1, at which point the `res` variable is written to the `gcd_result` port.

The `calculate_gcd` method is sensitive to changes in both `a` and `b`, as indicated by the `sensitive` clause.

Here is the SystemC code snippet that reflects the same behavior as the original C++/C source code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(GCD) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> gcd_result; // Output port for the GCD

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(GCD) {
        // Method to calculate the GCD
        SC_METHOD(calculate_gcd);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to calculate the GCD of two numbers
    void calculate_gcd() {
        int res = std::min(a, b);
        int divisor = res;
        while (res > 1) {
            if (a % res == 0 && b % res == 0)
                break;
            divisor--;
        }
        gcd_result.write(divisor);
    }
};
```
