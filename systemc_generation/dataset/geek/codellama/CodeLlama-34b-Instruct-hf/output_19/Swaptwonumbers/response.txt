  **Inputs:**

* `a`: An integer signal representing the first number to be swapped.
* `b`: An integer signal representing the second number to be swapped.

**Outputs:**

* `out_a`: An integer signal representing the new value of the first number.
* `out_b`: An integer signal representing the new value of the second number.

**Summary:**

The given C++/C code is a simple program that swaps the values of two integers using a third variable as a temporary storage. The program first declares the `a` and `b` variables and initializes them to `2` and `3`, respectively. Then, it declares a temporary variable `temp` and assigns it the value of `a`. The program then assigns the value of `b` to `a` and `temp` to `b`. Finally, it prints the swapped values of `a` and `b` to the console.

In SystemC, we can implement this program using the following code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Swapper) {
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;
    sc_out<int> out_a;
    sc_out<int> out_b;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Swapper) {
        // Process to perform swapping
        SC_METHOD(swap);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    /* Method to perform swapping.
     * Note: We use the same temporary variable as in the C++/C code.
     * This is not required in SystemC, but it helps to make the code
     * more readable.
     */
    void swap() {
        int temp = a.read();
        a.write(b.read());
        b.write(temp);
    }
};
```
The `Swapper` module has four ports: two input ports (`a` and `b`) and two output ports (`out_a` and `out_b`). The `swap` process is sensitive to changes in both `a` and `b`, meaning that it will be triggered whenever either of those signals changes value. When triggered, the `swap` method performs the swapping operation by first reading the value of `a` and storing it in `temp`. Then, it assigns the value of `b` to `a` and `temp` to `b`. The new values of `a` and `b` are then written to `out_a` and `out_b`, respectively.

Note that we have used the same temporary variable as in the C++/C code, but this is not strictly necessary in SystemC. Using a temporary variable can make the code more readable, but it is not required.
