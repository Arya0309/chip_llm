**Outputs:**

**Line-by-line Summary:**

1. `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`
	* This line includes the standard C++ library.
2. `using namespace std;`
	* This line tells the compiler to use the standard C++ namespace.
3. `class Complex { ... };`
	* This line defines a new class called `Complex`.
4. `public: int real, imaginary;`
	* This line declares two public variables of type `int` called `real` and `imaginary`. These variables will be used to store the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers.
5. `Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0)`
	* This line is a constructor for the `Complex` class. It takes two optional parameters, `tempReal` and `tempImaginary`, which default to 0 if not provided. The constructor sets the `real` and `imaginary` variables to the values of `tempReal` and `tempImaginary`, respectively.
6. `Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)`
	* This line defines a member function of the `Complex` class called `addComp`. It takes two complex numbers, `C1` and `C2`, as input.
7. `Complex temp;`
	* This line creates a local variable of type `Complex` called `temp`.
8. `temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;`
	* This line adds the real parts of `C1` and `C2` and assigns the result to the `real` variable of `temp`.
9. `temp.imaginary = C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary;`
	* This line adds the imaginary parts of `C1` and `C2` and assigns the result to the `imaginary` variable of `temp`.
10. `return temp;`
	* This line returns the `temp` variable, which now contains the sum of `C1` and `C2`.
11. `int main() { ... }`
	* This line defines the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.
12. `// First Complex number`
	* This line is a comment that explains the purpose of the next line.
13. `Complex C1(3, 2);`
	* This line creates a complex number `C1` with a real part of 3 and an imaginary part of 2.
14. `cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;`
	* This line prints the value of `C1` to the console using C++'s `cout` function. The `<<` operator is used to concatenate the string "Complex number 1 : " with the real and imaginary parts of `C1`, separated by a `+` sign, and the string "i" (which denotes the imaginary part).
15. `// Second Complex number`
	* This line is a comment that explains the purpose of the next line.
16. `Complex C2(9, 5);`
	* This line creates a complex number `C2` with a real part of 9 and an imaginary part of 5.
17. `cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;`
	* This line prints the value of `C2` to the console using C++'s `cout` function. The `<<` operator is used to concatenate the string "Complex number 2 : " with the real and imaginary parts of `C2`, separated by a `+` sign, and the string "i" (which denotes the imaginary part).
18. `// For Storing the sum`
	* This line is a comment that explains the purpose of the next line.
19. `Complex C3;`
	* This line creates a complex number `C3`.
20. `C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);`
	* This line assigns the result of calling the `addComp` function on `C1` and `C2`, which returns a new complex number with the sum of the two complex numbers, to `C3`.
21. `cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;`
	* This line prints the value of `C3` to the console using C++'s `cout` function. The `<<` operator is used to concatenate the string "Sum of complex number : " with the real and imaginary parts of `C3`, separated by a `+` sign, and the string "i" (which denotes the imaginary part).

**Corresponding SystemC Code:**

```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ComplexNumberAddition)
{
    sc_in<int> real1;
    sc_in<int> imag1;
    sc_in<int> real2;
    sc_in<int> imag2;
    sc_out<int> real_sum;
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;

    void addComp()
    {
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());
        imag_sum.write(imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```

In this code, we define a SystemC module called `ComplexNumberAddition`, which takes five input signals (`real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, and `imag_sum`) and two output signals (`real_sum` and `imag_sum`). The `addComp` function is called when the `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2` signals change. It calculates the sum of the two complex numbers using the real and imaginary parts of the input signals, and assigns the results to the `real_sum` and `imag_sum` signals, respectively.

Note that in this SystemC code, we have used the `sc_in` and `sc_out` types to define the input and output signals, respectively. These types are provided by the SystemC library and are used to define ports (i.e., input and output interfaces) on SystemC modules.
