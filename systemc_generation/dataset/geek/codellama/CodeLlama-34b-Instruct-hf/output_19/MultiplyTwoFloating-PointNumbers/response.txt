  **Inputs**:

* `A`: A floating-point number
* `B`: A floating-point number

**Output**:

* `product`: The product of `A` and `B`

**Summary**:

The provided C++/C code defines a function called `mul_floatnumbers` that takes two floating-point numbers, `a` and `b`, as input and returns their product.

The code then defines two variables, `A` and `B`, and calls the `mul_floatnumbers` function with these variables as arguments. The result is then printed to the console.

**Equivalent SystemC code**:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(multiplier) {
    sc_in<float> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<float> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<float> product; // Output port for the product

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(multiplier) {
        // Process to perform multiplication
        SC_METHOD(mul);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to multiply the two numbers
    void mul() {
        product.write(a.read() * b.read());
    }
};
```
Note that the equivalent SystemC code utilizes the `sc_in`, `sc_out`, and `sc_ctor` classes to define the input and output ports and constructor for the `multiplier` module. The method to perform the multiplication is defined within the constructor and specifies that it is sensitive to changes in both `a` and `b`. Whenever either `a` or `b` changes, the `mul` method is called, which updates the output port `product` with the product of the two input values.
