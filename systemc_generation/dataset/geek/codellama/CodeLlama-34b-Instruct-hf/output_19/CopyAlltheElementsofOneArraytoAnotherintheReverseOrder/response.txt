  **Inputs:**

* original_arr: An array of integers.
* len: The length of the original_arr array.

**Outputs:**

* Copied_arr: An array of integers that is a copy of the original_arr array in reverse order.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. `int original_arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`: Declares and initializes an array of integers named `original_arr` with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
2. `int len = sizeof(original_arr) / sizeof(original_arr[0]);`: Calculates the length of the `original_arr` array and stores it in a variable named `len`.
3. `int copied_arr[len], i, j;`: Declares three variables: `copied_arr`, which is an array of integers with a length equal to `len`; `i`, which is an integer variable used as an iterator in the for loop; and `j`, which is an integer variable used as an iterator in the for loop.
4. `for (i = 0; i < len; i++)`: This is a for loop that iterates over the `original_arr` array. The loop starts at the beginning of the array (i = 0) and ends at the end of the array (i < len). The loop increments by 1 each iteration (i++).
5. `copied_arr[i] = original_arr[len - i - 1];`: This line of code copies the value of the `original_arr` array at the current index (i) and stores it in the `copied_arr` array at the current index (i) in reverse order. For example, if the current index is 0, the value of `copied_arr` at index 0 is set to the value of `original_arr` at index 4 (since 0 + 4 - 1 = 3, which is the last index of the `original_arr` array).
6. `printf(" Original array: ");` and `printArray(original_arr, len);`: These lines print the original array to the console. `printArray` is a function that prints the values of the array one by one, separated by a space.
7. `printf(" Resultant array: ");` and `printArray(copied_arr, len);`: These lines print the copied array to the console.

**SystemC Code Snippet:**

Here is a SystemC code snippet that captures the logic of the C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(ReverseCopy) {
    sc_in<int> original_arr[];  // Input port for the original array
    sc_out<int> copied_arr[];  // Output port for the copied array
    sc_out<bool> done;  // Output port to indicate that the array has been copied

    void copy() {
        int len = original_arr.size();
        int i;

        // Copy the elements of the array in reverse order
        for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            copied_arr[i].write(original_arr[len - i - 1].read());
        }

        // Indicate that the array has been copied
        done.write(true);
    }

    SC_CTOR(ReverseCopy) {
        SC_THREAD(copy);
        sensitive << original_arr;
        async_reset_signal_is(done, false);
    }
};
```
This SystemC module has two input ports: `original_arr` and `done`. The `original_arr` port is an array of integers and represents the input array. The `done` port is a boolean signal and indicates whether the copying process has finished. The module has two output ports: `copied_arr` and `done`. The `copied_arr` port is an array of integers and represents the copied array. The `done` port is also a boolean signal and is used to indicate that the copying process has finished.

Inside the module, there is a `copy` thread that iterates over the `original_arr` array in reverse order and copies the values of the array to the `copied_arr` array. The `done` signal is set to `true` when the copying process is finished. The `async_reset_signal_is` function is used to reset the `done` signal to `false` when the module is reset.

The module can be used in a high-level synthesis flow by instantiating the `ReverseCopy` module and connecting the input and output signals to other modules in the design.
