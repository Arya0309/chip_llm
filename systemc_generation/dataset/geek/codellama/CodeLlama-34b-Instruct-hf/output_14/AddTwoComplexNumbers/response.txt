  **Inputs:**

* `real1` and `imag1`: Inputs for the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number.
* `real2` and `imag2`: Inputs for the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number.

**Outputs:**

* `real_sum` and `imag_sum`: Outputs for the real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code defines a `Complex` class that represents a complex number with real and imaginary parts. The class has a constructor that initializes the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. The class also has an `addComp` method that takes two `Complex` objects as input and returns their sum.

The `main` function creates two `Complex` objects, `C1` and `C2`, and assigns real and imaginary parts to them. It then calls the `addComp` method on `C1` and `C2`, and assigns the result to `C3`. Finally, it prints the real and imaginary parts of `C3` to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc>

// Module that adds two complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
    // Input ports for real and imaginary parts of first complex number
    sc_in<int> real1;
    sc_in<int> imag1;

    // Input ports for real and imaginary parts of second complex number
    sc_in<int> real2;
    sc_in<int> imag2;

    // Output port for real part of sum
    sc_out<int> real_sum;

    // Output port for imaginary part of sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        // Calculate real part of sum
        real_sum.write(real1.read() + real2.read());

        // Calculate imaginary part of sum
        imag_sum.write((imag1.read() + imag2.read());
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a `ComplexAdder` module that takes four input ports, `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`, for the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers. The module also has two output ports, `real_sum` and `imag_sum`, for the real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers.

The `add` method, which is triggered by the four input ports, calculates the real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers and writes them to the `real_sum` and `imag_sum` output ports, respectively.
