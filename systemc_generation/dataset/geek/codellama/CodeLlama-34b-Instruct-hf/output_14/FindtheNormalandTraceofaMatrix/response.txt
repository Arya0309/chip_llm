  **Inputs:**

* A two-dimensional array of integers `mat[][MAX]` representing a square matrix.
* An integer `n` representing the size of the matrix.

**Outputs:**

* An integer `trace` representing the trace of the matrix, which is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal.
* An integer `norm` representing the normal of the matrix, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of its elements.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code defines two functions: `findTrace` and `findNormal`. The `findTrace` function takes a square matrix and its size as input and returns the trace of the matrix, which is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal. The `findNormal` function takes a square matrix and its size as input and returns the normal of the matrix, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of its elements.

The `main` function first declares a 5x5 matrix `mat` with all elements set to 1. Then, it calls the `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions with `mat` and its size 5 as input, and prints the results to the console.

**SystemC Code:**

Here is a SystemC snippet that reflects the same behavior as the C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Define the matrix structure
struct mat_t {
    int n;
    int data[MAX][MAX];
};

// Define the inputs and outputs
sc_in<mat_t> matrix;
sc_out<int> trace;
sc_out<int> norm;

// Module that calculates trace and normal
SC_MODULE(MatProc) {
    // Add the inputs and outputs
    SC_CTOR(MatProc) {
        SC_METHOD(process);
        sensitive << matrix;
    }

    void process() {
        int trace = 0;
        int norm = 0;

        // Calculate trace
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.n; i++) {
            trace += matrix.data[i][i];
        }

        // Calculate normal
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix.n; j++) {
                norm += matrix.data[i][j] * matrix.data[i][j];
            }
        }

        // Write the results to the outputs
        trace.write(trace);
        norm.write(sqrt(norm));
    }

    // Return the results
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we define a `MatProc` module that takes a `matrix` input and an output for `trace` and `norm`. The `process` method calculates the trace and normal of the matrix and writes the results to the output signals. We then use the `MatProc` module in the `main` function to calculate the trace and normal of the 5x5 matrix `mat`.
