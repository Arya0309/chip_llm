  **Inputs:**

* `A`: A two-dimensional array of integers of size `N x N`, representing the original matrix.
* `B`: A two-dimensional array of integers of size `N x N`, representing the transpose of the original matrix.

**Outputs:**

* `B`: The transpose of the original matrix.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code defines a function `transpose()` that takes two two-dimensional arrays `A` and `B` as inputs. The function stores the transpose of `A` in `B`. The driver code initializes two arrays `A` and `B` and passes them to the `transpose()` function. The function then transposes `A` and stores the result in `B`. The driver code then prints the transposed matrix.

In the SystemC snippet, we define a module `Transpose` that takes two input ports `A` and `B` and one output port `B`. The module has a sensitivity list that includes `A` and `B`, which means that the function `transpose()` is triggered whenever `A` or `B` changes. The function `transpose()` then transposes `A` and stores the result in `B`.

**Corresponding SystemC code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Transpose) {
    sc_in<sc_logic> A[N][N];
    sc_out<sc_logic> B[N][N];

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Transpose) {
        // Process to perform transpose
        SC_METHOD(transpose);
        sensitive << A << B;
    }

    // Method to transpose A and store the result in B
    void transpose() {
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                B[i][j] = A[j][i];
            }
        }
    }
};
```
