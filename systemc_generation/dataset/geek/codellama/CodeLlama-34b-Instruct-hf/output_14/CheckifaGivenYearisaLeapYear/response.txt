  **Inputs:**  A single integer: `year`

Outputs: A boolean value: `is_leap_year`

**Summary:**
The program starts by defining a function called `checkYear` that accepts an integer year as its argument. The function checks whether a year is a leap year or not. It does this by following these steps:

1. It first checks if the year is divisible by 400, and if it is, the function returns `true` as the input year is a leap year.
2. If the year is not divisible by 400, the function then checks if the year is divisible by 100, and if it is, the function returns `false` as the input year is not a leap year.
3. If the year is not divisible by 100, the function then checks if the year is divisible by 4, and if it is, the function returns `true` as the input year is a leap year.
4. If the year is not divisible by 4, the function returns `false` as the input year is not a leap year.

The main function of the program receives an integer input and calls the `checkYear` function, passing in the input year. If the returned value is `true`, the program prints "Leap Year," and if the returned value is `false`, the program prints "Not a Leap Year."

**Translating to SystemC:**
To translate the code to SystemC, we can create a SystemC module that takes in an integer `year` and returns a `true` or `false` value depending on whether the input year is a leap year or not. We can also use the `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<bool>` ports defined above.
```scss
// SystemC module to check if a year is a leap year
SC_MODULE(LeapYear) {
    sc_in<int> year; // Input port for the year
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year; // Output port for whether the year is a leap year

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LeapYear) {
        // Register the input and output ports
        SC_METHOD(check_year);
    }

    // Method to check if the year is a leap year
    void check_year() {
        if (year % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year % 100 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        } else if (year % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```
Here, we have created a SystemC module called `LeapYear` that takes in an integer `year` and returns a `true` or `false` value depending on whether the input year is a leap year or not. The module has an input port `year` and an output port `is_leap_year`. The constructor of the module registers the input and output ports. The `check_year` method is called whenever there is a change in the input port `year`. The method checks the input year and sets the output port `is_leap_year` to `true` or `false` based on the result of the check.
