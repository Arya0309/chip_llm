  **Inputs:**

* `key`: A 32-bit integer representing the value to search for in the vector.
* `v`: A vector of 32-bit integers.

**Outputs:**

* `index`: A 32-bit integer representing the index of the found value in the vector, or -1 if the value is not found.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code implements a function `linearSearch` that performs a linear search for a given value in a vector. The function takes two input parameters: `v`, a vector of integers, and `key`, the value to search for. The function returns the index of the found value in the vector, or -1 if the value is not found.

The function starts by declaring two local variables: `i` and `found`. The `i` variable is an integer used as an index into the vector, while the `found` variable is a boolean that is initially set to false.

The function then enters a loop that iterates through the vector `v`. Inside the loop, the function checks if the current element of the vector is equal to the value of `key`. If the current element is equal to `key`, the function sets the `found` variable to true and sets the `index` variable to the current index of the vector. If the current element is not equal to `key`, the function increments the index and continues to the next iteration of the loop.

If the end of the vector is reached without finding the value of `key`, the function returns -1.

**SystemC Code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LinearSearch) {
    sc_in<int> key;
    sc_in<int> v;
    sc_out<int> index;

    // Process to perform linear search
    SC_METHOD(linearSearch) {
        // Local variables
        int i = 0;
        bool found = false;

        while (i < v.size() && !found) {
            if (v[i] == key) {
                found = true;
                index.write(i);
            }
            i++;
        }

        if (!found) {
            index.write(-1);
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have defined a module called `LinearSearch` that takes three input ports: `key`, a 32-bit integer representing the value to search for; `v`, a vector of 32-bit integers representing the vector to search; and `index`, a 32-bit integer representing the index of the found value.

The module contains a single method `linearSearch` that implements the logic of the C++/C code. The method starts by initializing the `i` and `found` local variables. The method then enters a loop that iterates through the vector `v`. Inside the loop, the method checks if the current element of the vector is equal to the value of `key`. If the current element is equal to `key`, the method sets the `found` variable to true and sets the `index` variable to the current index of the vector. If the current element is not equal to `key`, the method increments the index and continues to the next iteration of the loop.

If the end of the vector is reached without finding the value of `key`, the method sets the `index` variable to -1.

In this way, the SystemC code captures the logic of the original C++/C code and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.
