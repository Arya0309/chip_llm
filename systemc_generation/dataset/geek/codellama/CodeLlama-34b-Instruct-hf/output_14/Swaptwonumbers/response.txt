  **Inputs:**

* `a`: The first integer to be swapped.
* `b`: The second integer to be swapped.

**Outputs:**

* `out_a`: The swapped value of `a`.
* `out_b`: The swapped value of `b`.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code takes in two integers, `a` and `b`, and swaps them using a temporary variable. The code then outputs the swapped values of `a` and `b`, respectively.

**Code Explanation:**

1. The code starts by including the Standard Template Library (STL) and using the `std` namespace.
2. The main function is defined, which takes in no arguments.
3. The integer variables `a` and `b` are declared and initialized to `2` and `3`, respectively.
4. The current values of `a` and `b` are printed to the console.
5. A temporary variable `temp` is declared and initialized to `a`.
6. The swapping algorithm is applied, where `a` is set to `b`, and `b` is set to `temp`.
7. The swapped values of `a` and `b` are printed to the console.

**SystemC Code:**
```c
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Swapper) {
    sc_in<int> a; // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b; // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> out_a; // Output port for the swapped value of a
    sc_out<int> out_b; // Output port for the swapped value of b

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Swapper) {
        // Process to perform swapping
        SC_METHOD(swap);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to swap the two numbers
    void swap() {
        int temp = a.read();
        a.write(b.read());
        b.write(temp);
        out_a.write(a.read());
        out_b.write(b.read());
    }
};
```

In this SystemC code, the `Swapper` module takes in two integer input signals `a` and `b`, and two integer output signals `out_a` and `out_b`. The `swap` method reads the values of `a` and `b`, swaps them using a temporary variable, and writes the swapped values to `out_a` and `out_b`. The `sensitive` statement in the constructor ensures that the `swap` method is triggered whenever the inputs change.
