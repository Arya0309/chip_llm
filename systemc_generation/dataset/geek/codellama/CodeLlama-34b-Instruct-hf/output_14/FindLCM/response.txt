  **Inputs**:

* `a`: The first number
* `b`: The second number

**Outputs**:

* `max_num`: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`

**Summary**:

This C++ program finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a loop and conditional statements. The program first declares two integer variables, `a` and `b`, and initializes them to 15 and 20, respectively. It then declares a third integer variable, `max_num`, which is initialized to the larger of `a` and `b` using the ternary operator.

The program then enters a while loop, which will iterate until the loop condition becomes false. The loop condition is set to `flag`, which is initially set to 1. Inside the loop, the program checks whether `max_num` is completely divisible by both `a` and `b`. If it is, the program prints the result and exits the loop by setting `flag` to 0. Otherwise, the program increments `max_num` by 1 and repeats the check.

Once the loop exits, the program prints the GCD as the largest number `max_num` that is divisible by both `a` and `b`.

**SystemC Code**:
```scss
// Module that finds the GCD of two integers
SC_MODULE(GCD) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> gcd; // Output port for the GCD

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(GCD) {
        // Process to find the GCD
        SC_METHOD(find_gcd);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to find the GCD
    void find_gcd() {
        // Initialize the maximum number to the larger of a and b
        int max_num = (a > b) ? a : b;

        // Loop until the gcd is found
        while (gcd.read() == 0) {
            // Check if max_num is completely divisible by a and b
            if (max_num % a == 0 && max_num % b == 0) {
                gcd.write(max_num);
                break;
            }

            // Increment max_num by 1
            max_num++;
        }
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we have an `SC_MODULE` called `GCD`, which has three ports: `a`, `b`, and `gcd`. The `SC_CTOR` declares a process that finds the GCD using a while loop and conditional statements. The process first initializes the maximum number `max_num` to the larger of `a` and `b`. Then, it enters a loop that iterates until `gcd.read()` is non-zero. Inside the loop, the process checks if `max_num` is completely divisible by both `a` and `b`. If it is, the process writes the GCD to the `gcd` output port and exits the loop. Otherwise, it increments `max_num` by 1 and repeats the check. Once the loop exits, the GCD is written to the `gcd` output port.
