  **Inputs:**

* `n`: An integer value representing the decimal number to be converted to binary.
* `binaryNum`: An array of integers used to store the binary representation of the input decimal number.

**Outputs:**

* `binaryNum`: An array of integers containing the binary representation of the input decimal number.

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C code is a function that takes in a decimal number `n` as input and converts it to its binary representation. The function first declares an array of integers named `binaryNum` to store the binary representation of the input decimal number. The function then sets up a loop to repeatedly divide the input decimal number by 2 and store the remainder in the `binaryNum` array until the input decimal number is 0. Once the loop exits, the function prints the contents of the `binaryNum` array in reverse order, which represents the binary representation of the input decimal number.

**SystemC code:**
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DecToBinary) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out;  // Output port for binary representation

    void decToBinary() {
        // Array to store binary representation of decimal number
        int binaryNum[32];

        // Counter for binary array
        int i = 0;

        // Loop to repeatedly divide decimal number by 2 and store remainder in binary array
        while (dec_in.read() > 0) {
            binaryNum[i] = dec_in.read() % 2;
            dec_in.write(dec_in.read() / 2);
            i++;
        }

        // Print binary array in reverse order
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
        }
    }
};
```
The SystemC code above faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source. The `DecToBinary` module takes in a decimal number `dec_in` as input and generates the binary representation of the input decimal number as output `binary_out`. The internal implementation of the module uses the same logic as the C++/C function, with the loop to repeatedly divide the input decimal number by 2 and store the remainder in the `binaryNum` array, and the print statement to print the binary array in reverse order.

Note that in the SystemC code, we have used the `sc_in` and `sc_out` ports to capture the input and output signals of the module, respectively. These ports are used to integrate the module with our existing testbench.
