  **C++/C Code Summary**

This code is a C++ function, `rotatematrix`, that takes three arguments: 

1. `m`: The number of rows in the input matrix
2. `n`: The number of columns in the input matrix
3. `mat`: The input matrix, represented as a two-dimensional array of integers with dimensions `m` x `n`.

The function `rotatematrix` rotates the input matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. 

To rotate the matrix, the following steps are followed:

1. Traverse the matrix from the top-left to the bottom-right, skipping the wrap around row and column elements when traversing the matrix.
2. Save the first element of the next row in the temporal variable `prev`.
3. Push each element of the current row to the matrix minus the element indices i(row, i) by looping over the `m - 1` rows as `i += 1` and setting each element `mat[i, col]` to `prev`.
4. Push the rest of the elements of the last column to the matrix starting from the element indices `m` and `col` by looping over the `n - 1` columns as `i -= 1` and setting each element `mat[row, i]` to `prev`.
5. Finally, push the elements of the last row to the matrix starting from the element indices `row` and `n` by looping over the `m - 1` rows as `i -= 1` and setting each element `mat[i, col]` to `prev`
    The algorithm is such that the elements in the first row are shifted down, the last column is shifted left, and the last row is shifted up, while keeping the elements in each row fixed.
6. Print the rotated matrix.

**SystemC Code**

Here is a SystemC code snippet that implements the logic of the `rotatematrix` function:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(RotateMatrix) {
    sc_in<int> m, n; // Input ports for the number of rows and columns in the matrix
    sc_in<int> mat[R][C]; // Input port for the matrix
    sc_out<int> out[R][C]; // Output port for the rotated matrix

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(RotateMatrix) {
        // Process to rotate the matrix
        SC_METHOD(rotate);
        sensitive << m << n << mat[0][0];
    }

    // Method to rotate the matrix
    void rotate() {
        int row = 0, col = 0;
        int prev, curr;
        
        while (row < m && col < n) {
            if (row + 1 == m || col + 1 == n)
                break;
            
            prev = mat[row + 1][col];
            
            for (int i = col; i < n; ++i) {
                curr = mat[row][i];
                mat[row][i] = prev;
                prev = curr;
            }
            row++;
            
            for (int i = row; i < m; ++i) {
                curr = mat[i][n - 1];
                mat[i][n - 1] = prev;
                prev = curr;
            }
            n--;
            
            if (row < m) {
                for (int i = n - 1; i >= col; --i) {
                    curr = mat[m - 1][i];
                    mat[m - 1][i] = prev;
                    prev = curr;
                }
            }
            m--;
            
            if (col < n) {
                for (int i = m - 1; i >= row; --i) {
                    curr = mat[i][col];
                    mat[i][col] = prev;
                    prev = curr;
                }
            }
            col++;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < R; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C; ++j) {
                out[i][j] = mat[i][j];
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In the code snippet, we declared two input ports `in` and `n` and two output ports `out` and `mat`. The inputs are connected to the corresponding ports, and the outputs are connected to the corresponding ports 
`out` is connected to The output port `out` is connected to the structâ€™s member variable `out`, which is an array of size 4*4. The output is captured in the output array at the end of the function call.

Note that the SystemC code snippet incorporates the `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<int>` signals defined in the provided signals, `in[SIZE];`and `out[SIZE];`. The SystemC code also utilizes the `struct` data structure to capture the input and output port data. Finally, The two input and two output ports are connected by the `sensitive` keyword to ensure synthesis.
