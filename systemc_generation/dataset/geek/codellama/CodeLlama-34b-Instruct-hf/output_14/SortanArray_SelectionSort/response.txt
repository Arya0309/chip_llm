  **Inputs:**

* `arr`: The unsorted integer array to be sorted.
* `n`: The size of the input array.

**Outputs:**

* `arr`: The sorted integer array.

**Line-by-Line Analysis:**

1. The code includes the standard input/output streams and the `std::vector` template library.
2. The `swap` function swaps the values of two integers pointed to by the `xp` and `yp` pointers.
3. The `selectionSort` function takes an integer array and its size as input and performs selection sort on the array.
	* The function declares three integer variables, `i`, `j`, and `min_idx`, to keep track of the current index, the minimum index, and the size of the unsorted subarray.
	* The outer loop iterates through the unsorted subarray and finds the minimum element in the subarray.
	* The minimum element is then swapped with the first element of the subarray.
	* The inner loop iterates through the rest of the unsorted subarray to find the minimum element.
	* The minimum element is swapped with the first element of the subarray.
	* The process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.
4. The `printArray` function takes an integer array and its size as input and prints the contents of the array.
5. The `main` function tests the `selectionSort` function by passing an unsorted array and its size as input. The sorted array is then printed.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SelectionSort) {
    sc_in<int> arr;
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<int> arr_out;

    void selectionSort() {
        int i, j, min_idx;
        for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            min_idx = i;
            for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) {
                    min_idx = j;
                }
            }
            swap(arr[min_idx], arr[i]);
        }
    }

    void swap(int val1, int val2) {
        int temp = val1;
        val1 = val2;
        val2 = temp;
    }

    SC_CTOR(SelectionSort) {
        SC_METHOD(selectionSort);
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int arr[] = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    SelectionSort sort(arr, n);
    sort.selectionSort();
    printArray(sort.arr_out, n);
    return 0;
}
```
In this SystemC code, the `SelectionSort` module takes in the input array `arr`, the size of the array `n`, and an output array `arr_out`. The `selectionSort` function is a method of the module that performs the selection sort algorithm. It declares three integer variables, `i`, `j`, and `min_idx`, to keep track of the current index, the minimum index, and the size of the unsorted subarray. The function then iterates through the unsorted subarray and finds the minimum element in the subarray. The minimum element is then swapped with the first element of the subarray. The inner loop iterates through the rest of the unsorted subarray to find the minimum element. The minimum element is swapped with the first element of the subarray. The process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

In the `sc_main` function, the input array `arr`, the size of the array `n`, and the output array `arr_out` are passed as arguments to the `SelectionSort` module. The `selectionSort` function is called on the `Sort` module. The sorted array is then printed using the `printArray` function.
