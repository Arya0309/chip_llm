  **Inputs**:

* `m`: a 2D integer array representing the matrix to be sorted, represented as a contiguous block of memory.
* `r`: the number of rows in the matrix.
* `c`: the number of columns in the matrix.

**Outputs**:

* `m`: the sorted matrix, sorted row-wise and in ascending order.

**Code Summary**:

The code defines a function `sortRowWise` that takes a 2D integer array `m`, a number of rows `r`, and a number of columns `c` as input. The function first loops over each row of the matrix, then loops over each column of the row, and finally, loops over each element of the column to compare and swap adjacent elements.

The function starts by declaring two variables `i` and `j` to keep track of the row and column indices, respectively. The outer loop iterates over each row of the matrix, and the inner loop iterates over each column of the current row. The innermost loop compares adjacent elements of the current column and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The swap is done using a function called `swap` that takes two integer pointers `xp` and `yp` as input, swaps the values pointed to by these pointers, and returns void.

After the sorting process is complete, the function prints the sorted matrix. The sorted matrix is then returned as the output.

**SystemC Code**:

    sc_in<bool> clk;  // Clock input
    sc_in<bool> start;  // Start signal input

        sc_int<32> j = 0;  // column index
        sc_int<32> r = m.size() / sizeof(m[0]);  // number of rows
        sc_int<32> c = m[0].size();  // number of columns

        // Loop over each row of the matrix
        for (i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            // Loop over each column of the current row
            for (j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                // Loop over each element of the current column
                for (sc_int<32> k = 0; k < c - j - 1; k++) {
                    // Compare adjacent elements and swap if necessary
                    if (m[i][k] > m[i][k + 1]) {
                        swap(m[i][k], m[i][k + 1]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Print the sorted matrix
        for (i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                cout << m_sorted[i][j] << " ";
                if (j == c - 1) {
                    cout << "\n";
                }
            }
            if (i == r - 1) {
                cout << "\n";
            }
        }

        done.write(true);  // Set done signal to true
    }

    // Method to swap two integers
    void swap(int *xp, int *yp) {
        int temp = *xp;
        *xp = *yp;
        *yp = temp;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `SortRowWise` that takes in the clock signal `clk`, the start signal `start`, the done signal `done`, the input matrix `m`, and the output sorted matrix `m_sorted`.

The constructor of the module defines the process `sortRowWise` that is sensitive to the clock `clk`. The `sortRowWise` process first declares two variables `i` and `j` to keep track of the row and column indices, respectively. The number of rows `r` and columns `c` are computed using the size of the matrix and the size of the first row.

The process then loops over each row of the matrix, loops over each column of the row, and then loops over each element of the column to compare and swap adjacent elements. The comparison and swapping is done using the `swap` method defined in the code.

After the sorting process is complete, the process prints the sorted matrix. The sorted matrix is then assigned to the output `m_sorted`. The `done` signal is set to `true` to indicate that the sorting process is complete.
