  Inputs:

* A square matrix of size `n` (`mat[]`, where `n` is the number of elements in the matrix).
* The size of the matrix (`n`).

Outputs:

* The sum of the elements on the principal diagonal (`principal`).
* The sum of the elements on the secondary diagonal (`secondary`).

The provided C++ code computes the sum of the elements on the principal diagonal and the secondary diagonal of a given square matrix. The code first declares two variables, `principal` and `secondary`, to store the sums. Then it goes through each element of the matrix and checks if the element is on the principal or secondary diagonal. If it is, the code adds the element to the appropriate sum. Finally, the code prints the principal and secondary diagonal sums to the console.

Here's a block-by-block explanation of the code:

1. The first block declares the necessary variables. `MAX` is a constant that sets the size limit for the matrix. `n` is the size of the matrix. `mat` is a two-dimensional array that stores the elements of the matrix. `principal` and `secondary` are variables that store the sums of the elements on the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively.
2. The second block initializes the `mat` array with some sample values.
3. The third block defines a function `printDiagonalSums` that takes the `mat` array and its size, `n`, as inputs.
4. The function first declares two variables, `principal` and `secondary`, to store the sums.
5. The function then goes through each element of the matrix using two nested for-loops. The outer loop iterates over the rows of the matrix, and the inner loop iterates over the columns of the matrix.
6. Inside the inner loop, the code checks if the element is on the principal diagonal. If it is, the code adds the element to the `principal` sum. Otherwise, it checks if the element is on the secondary diagonal. If it is, the code adds the element to the `secondary` sum.
7. After both loops finish, the code prints the principal and secondary diagonal sums to the console.

Here's an equivalent SystemC code snippet that reflects the same behavior:
```c++
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(MatrixDiagonalSums) {
    // Inputs
    sc_in<int> mat[100][100];
    sc_in<int> n;

    // Outputs
    sc_out<int> principal;
    sc_out<int> secondary;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatrixDiagonalSums) {
        // Process to compute the sums
        SC_CTHREAD(process, CLK.posedge_event());
        reset_signal_is(reset, false);
    }

    // Method to compute the sums
    void process() {
        while (1) {
            // Reset the variables
            principal = 0;
            secondary = 0;

            // Go through each element of the matrix
            for (int i = 0; i < n.read(); i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n.read(); j++) {
                    // Check if the element is on the principal diagonal
                    if (i == j) {
                        principal += mat.read(i, j);
                    }

                    // Check if the element is on the secondary diagonal
                    if (i + j == n.read() - 1) {
                        secondary += mat.read(i, j);
                    }
                }
            }

            // Print the sums
            printf("Principal Diagonal: %d\n", principal.read());
            printf("Secondary Diagonal: %d\n", secondary.read());

            // Wait for the next clock cycle
            wait();
        }
    }
};
```
In this code, we define a SystemC module called `MatrixDiagonalSums` that takes an nxn matrix, `mat`, and its size, `n`, as inputs, and outputs the principal and secondary diagonal sums. The module has a single process `process` that computes the sums and waits for the next clock cycle using the `wait()` function.

The code declares and initializes the input and output ports using the `sc_in`, `sc_out`, and `sc_in_out` classes. The `process` method goes through each element of the matrix using two nested for-loops and checks if the element is on the principal or secondary diagonal. If it is, the code adds the element to the appropriate sum. Finally, the code prints the principal and secondary diagonal sums to the console using the `printf` function.

Note that this SystemC code snippet assumes that the matrix is stored in a 2D array and that the size of the matrix is provided as an input. If the matrix is stored in a different data structure or if the matrix size is not provided as an input, the code may need to be modified accordingly.
