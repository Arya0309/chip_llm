  C++/C Code:
```
// C++ program to find the LCM of two
// numbers using the if statement and
// while loop
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Driver code
int main()
{
    int a = 15, b = 20, max_num, flag = 1;

    // Use ternary operator to get the
    // large number
    max_num = (a > b) ? a : b;

    while (flag) {
        // if statement checks max_num is completely
        // divisible by n1 and n2.
        if (max_num % a == 0 && max_num % b == 0) {
            cout << "LCM of " << a << " and " << b << " is "
                << max_num;
            break;
        }

        // update by 1 on each iteration
        ++max_num;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Inputs:**

* a = 15
* b = 20

**Outputs:**

* LCM of a (15) and b (20) is 60

**Explanation:**
The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two numbers is the smallest number that both numbers can divide into evenly. In this code, we find the LCM of two numbers a and b. To do this, we check if the large number (max_num) is divisible by both a and b. We use an if statement to check if the remainder of dividing max_num by a and dividing max_num by b both equal zero. If both are zero, we print the LCM of a and b.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. `int main() {`
* This starts the main function.
2. `int a = 15, b = 20, max_num, flag = 1;`
* This declares three variables: `a`, `b`, and `max_num`. The initial values for `a` and `b` are 15 and 20, respectively. `max_num` is a placeholder that we will use in the while loop. `flag` is set to 1 to indicate that we are in the loop.
3. `max_num = (a > b) ? a : b;`
* This line of code uses a ternary operator to find the larger of `a` and `b`. If `a` is larger, then `max_num` is set to `a`; otherwise, it is set to `b`.
4. `while (flag) {`
* This is the start of a while loop.
5. `if (max_num % a == 0 && max_num % b == 0) {`
* This if statement checks if `max_num` is divisible by both `a` and `b`. The modulus operator `%` returns the remainder of the division of `max_num` by `a` and `b`.
6. `cout << "LCM of " << a << " and " << b << " is " << max_num;
* This line of code prints the result of the LCM of `a` and `b` to the screen.
7. `break;`
* This line exits the while loop.
8. `}`
* This ends the while loop.
9. `return 0;`
* This ends the main function.

**SystemC Code:**
```c
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that finds the LCM of two numbers
SC_MODULE(LCM) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> lcm_result; // Output port for the LCM result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LCM) {
        // Process to find the LCM
        SC_METHOD(find_lcm);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to find the LCM
    void find_lcm() {
        // Placeholder for the LCM result
        int lcm_result_local = 0;

        // Initialize the large number
        int max_num = (a > b) ? a : b;

        // Loop until the LCM is found
        while (true) {
            // Check if the LCM is divisible by both a and b
            if (max_num % a == 0 && max_num % b == 0) {
                // Update the LCM result
                lcm_result_local = max_num;
                break;
            }

            // Update the large number by 1
            ++max_num;
        }

        // Write the LCM result to the output port
        lcm_result.write(lcm_result_local);
    }
};
```

**Inputs:**

* a = 15
* b = 20

**Outputs:**

* LCM of a (15) and b (20) is 60

Note that the SystemC code uses the `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals to declare the inputs and outputs of the module. The `LCM` module takes `a` and `b` as inputs and outputs the result of the LCM calculation using the `lcm_result` signal.
