  Dear Student,

Thank you for choosing to use my services for your task. I understand that you require a thorough analysis of the provided C++/C code and its translation into SystemC code. I have analyzed the code and understand the inputs, outputs, and functionality of the C++/C program.

**Inputs**:

The inputs to the C++/C program are the matrix and size (n), which are provided to the main function. The input matrix is a two-dimensional array of integers, and the size n is an integer representing the size of the matrix.

**Outputs**:

The outputs of the C++/C program are two integers: the principal diagonal sum and the secondary diagonal sum. These integers are output to the console using the cout statement.

**Functionality**:

The C++/C program contains two functions: void printDiagonalSums(int mat[][MAX], int n) and int main(). The printDiagonalSums function takes in a two-dimensional array of integers and an integer representing the size of the matrix as input. It calculates the sum of the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix and outputs the sum to the console. The main function calls the printDiagonalSums function and provides it with the input values.

**Analysis**:

The C++/C code can be analyzed as follows:

- The printDiagonalSums function begins by initializing two integer variables: principal and secondary. These variables will be used to store the sum of the principal and secondary diagonals of the input matrix.
- The function then begins a nested loop that iterates over each element of the input matrix.
- Within each iteration of the loop, the function checks the values of i and j. If i is equal to j, then the element at position (i, j) is the element of the principal diagonal. If (i + j) is equal to (n - 1), then the element at position (i, j) is the element of the secondary diagonal.
- The function then adds the element at position (i, j) to the appropriate sum variable (principal or secondary).
- When the loop has completed, the function outputs the principal and secondary diagonal sums to the console using the cout statement.

**SystemC Code**:
Here is an example of the SystemC code generated based on the analysis:

// Module that calculates the sum of the principal and secondary diagonals 
SC_MODULE(DiagonalSum) { 
  sc_in<int>* matrix;  // Input port for the matrix 
  sc_in<int>* size;    // Input port for the size of the matrix 
  sc_out<int> principal;    // Output port for the principal diagonal sum 
  sc_out<int> secondary;  // Output port for the secondary diagonal sum 

  // Constructor 
  SC_CTOR(DiagonalSum) { 
	// Process to calculate the principal and secondary diagonal sums 
	SC_METHOD(calculateDiagonalSums); 
	sensitive << *matrix << *size; 
  } 

  // Method to calculate the principal and secondary diagonal sums 
  void calculateDiagonalSums() { 
	// Initialize the sum variables to 0 
	int principal = 0; 
	int secondary = 0; 

	// Calculate the sum of the principal and secondary diagonals 
	for (int i = 0; i < *size; i++) { 
	  for (int j = i; j < *size; j++) { 
		// If the current element is on the principal diagonal, add it to the sum 
		if (i == j) { 
		  principal += matrix[i][j]; 
		} 

		//If the current element is on the secondary diagonal, add it to the sum 
		if ((i + j) == (*size - 1)) { 
		  secondary += matrix[i][j]; 
		} 
	  } 
	} 

	// Output the principal and secondary diagonal sums 
	principal.write(principal); 
	secondary.write(secondary);
  } 
}; 

In order to provide an equivalent SystemC code to the provided C++/C code, I have generated a SystemC module called DiagonalSum. This module has three input ports: matrix, size, and two output ports: principal and secondary. The module has a constructor and a calculateDiagonalSums method, which calculate the sum of the principal and secondary diagonals of the matrix and output the results to the console using the cout statement.

I do not claim that this is the only way to accomplish the task. Other approaches could have been taken, and this may be a modification of the original code. However, this was my attempt to understand and translate the original code into SystemC code.	

I have included the input and output ports and the code blocks for the SystemC module in the example, as requested.
