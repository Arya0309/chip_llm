  **Question 1:** Please read the provided C++/C code and identify the input(s) and output(s) of the code.

* The input(s) of the code are the dividend (Dividend) and divisor (Divisor) values, which are read from the user through the Console Input/Output interface.
* The output(s) of the code are the quotient (Quotient) and remainder (Remainder) values, which are output to the user through the Console Output interface.

**Question 2:** Provide a detailed natural language summary of the C++/C code.

* The C++/C program implements a function to find the quotient (Quotient) and remainder (Remainder).
* The function takes in two integer arguments, Dividend and Divisor, which are read from user input.
* If the Divisor is zero, the function outputs an error message and exits.
* Otherwise, the function divides the Dividend by the Divisor to calculate the quotient, and calculates the remainder by dividing the Dividend by the Divisor.
* The quotient and remainder are then printed to the user through the Console Output interface.

**Question 3:** Generate equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.

* Here is an example of equivalent SystemC code that reflects the same behavior:

```scss
import <systemc.h>;

// Module for dividing integers
SC_MODULE(Divide) {
    // Input ports
    sc_in<int> dividend;
    sc_in<int> divisor;

    // Output ports
    sc_out<int> quotient;
    sc_out<int> remainder;
    sc_out<bool> error;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Divide) {
        SC_METHOD(divide);
        sensitive << dividend << divisor;
    }

    // Method to divide the arguments
    void divide() {
        int quotient_int, remainder_int;

        // Check for division by zero
        if (divisor.read() == 0) {
            error.write(true);
        } else {
            quotient.write(dividend.read() / divisor.read());
            remainder.write(dividend.read() % divisor.read());

            cout << "The quotient = " << quotient << endl;
            cout << "The remainder = " << remainder << endl;
        }
    }

    // Function to print error message
    void errorMessage() {
        cout << "Error: Divisor cannot be zero." << endl;
    }
}
```
Note that the SystemC code incorporates the input and output signals defined above (`dividend`, `divisor`, `quotient`, `remainder`, `error`). The `divide()` method checks for division by zero and calculates the quotient and remainder accordingly. The `errorMessage()` method prints an error message if the divisor is zero.
