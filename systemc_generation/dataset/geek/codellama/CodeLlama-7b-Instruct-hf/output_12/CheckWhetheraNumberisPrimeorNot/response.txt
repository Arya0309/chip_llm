  Here is a summary of the provided C++/C code, including a natural language explanation and an equivalent SystemC snippet:

**Inputs**:

* n (int)

**Outputs**:

* is_prime (bool)

**Code Structure**:

1. The input (n) is read into the variable cnt.
2. The code checks if the input (n) is less than or equal to 1. If so, the code prints "n is NOT prime". Otherwise, the code checks if the input (n) is divisible by more than 2 numbers. If so, the code prints "n is NOT prime". Otherwise, the code prints "n is prime".
3. The code defines a function called add(), which takes in the input (n) and checks how many numbers are divisible by n. The code adds 1 to the counter (cnt) if the input (n) is divisible by i. Finally, the code checks if the counter (cnt) is greater than 2. If so, the code prints "n is NOT prime".
4. The code defines a loop that checks for divisors from 1 to n and performs the add() function.

**SystemC Equivalent**:
```scss
// Define input and output ports
sc_in<int> n;
sc_out<bool> is_prime;

// Define the module
module my_module(n, is_prime)
{
    // Define a local counter
    int cnt = 0;

    // Check if the input is less than or equal to 1
    if (n <= 1) {
        // Print "n is NOT prime"
        cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;
    }
    // Otherwise, check if the input is divisible by more than 2 numbers
    else {
        // Define a loop to check divisors
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // Check if the input is divisible by i
            if (n % i == 0) {
                // Add 1 to the counter
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        // Check if the counter is greater than 2
        if (cnt > 2) {
            // Print "n is NOT prime"
            cout << n << " is NOT prime" << endl;
        }
        // Otherwise, print "n is prime"
        else {
            cout << n << " is prime" << endl;
        }
    }
}
```
In this SystemC code, we define the input and output ports, and then define the module that checks for primality. The module uses a similar logic to the C++/C code, with the addition of a loop to check for divisors. It prints "n is NOT prime" if the input is less than or equal to 1, or if the input is divisible by more than 2 numbers. Otherwise, it prints "n is prime".

Note that this SystemC code utilizes the input and output ports defined above, so it can interface seamlessly with an existing testbench.
