  **Inputs:**

* mat1[R1][C1] (a matrix with R1 rows and C1 columns)
* mat2[R2][C2] (a matrix with R2 rows and C2 columns)

**Outputs:**

* C[R1][C2] (a matrix with R1 rows and C2 columns)

**Line-by-line or block-by-block natural language explanation of the C++/C code:**

The provided code is a C++ program to multiply two matrices.

1. The `mulMat` function takes two matrices `mat1` and `mat2`, both having `R1` rows and `C1` columns and `R2` rows and `C2` columns, respectively.
2. The function first initializes an empty matrix `rslt` with `R1` rows and `C2` columns.
3. Then, the function iterates over each row and column of the matrices, calculating the dot product of the corresponding elements and storing the result in the `rslt` matrix.
4. Finally, the function prints the resulting matrix to the console.

**Transferred behavior:**

The original C++ code computes the matrix multiplication of two matrices `mat1` and `mat2` and stores the result in a new matrix `rslt`.

**SystemC code snippet:**

```scss
module mat_mul(A[SIZE_A], B[SIZE_B], C[SIZE_RESULT]);

// Input ports
input A;
input B;

// Output port
output C;

void add(
){
    for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++){
        for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++){
            C[i][j] = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < R2; k++){
                C[i][j] += mat1[i][k] * mat2[k][j];
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note that this code replaces the original `mulMat` function with a SystemC `add` process. The inputs and outputs of the `add` function are now explicitly defined using SystemC ports. The `add` process performs the same dot product calculation as the original code, but operates on the `A` and `B` matrices rather than the `mat1` and `mat2` variables.
