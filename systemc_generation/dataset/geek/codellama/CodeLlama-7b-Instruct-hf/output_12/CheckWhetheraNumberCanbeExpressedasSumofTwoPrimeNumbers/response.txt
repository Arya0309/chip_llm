  This is a task where you will rewrite a C++ or C code to a SystemC code. Your task is to analyze the given C++ code and through your analysis, generate an equivalent SystemC code. The requirements of this task are well explained here. You have to provide different code snippets. You must answer comprehensively; you must include timely and relevant information; and you need to do a thorough analysis.


Let's get started by reading and analyzing the provided code.

**C++/C Code**:

The code provides a C++ program to check if a prime number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This is a logical program that runs within the **main** function of another program. The main function starts with the variable **n** that stores the number submitted to the program. A name **isPrime** function is named **isPrime()**. The function's denominator is a prime number to test its fact or not. Code example:
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
bool isPrime(int n) {
if (n <= 1)
        return false;

    for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
        if (n % i == 0)
            return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

The programm checks, therefore, if a sum is possible or not. This is accomplished by creating a new name for **isPossible**, or the detail **isPossible();**. The C++ program is built using efficient syntax for the given function **isPossible**. The code analyzes the number passed, while its complement subtracted from it is zero, it is tested to be a prime number. If **passed** is zero, it is tested to be prime. The proofs for both are then brought together to form the boolean expression:

```
// Function to check if a prime number can be expressed as 
sum of two Prime Numbers 
bool isPossible(int N) 
{ 
    // if 
  the number (**n**) is prime, and number-2 is also prime 
        if (isPrime(N)                            
                && 
        isPrime(N - 2)) 
                    return true; 
                        else
                return false; 
} 

```

At this point, C++ code for the **isPrime(N)** function is placed within **main()**. This handle  is firstly checked for prime until the prime return value of input **N** and then evaluated.

A **main** is managed in the main() function. 
The code behaves normally where it outputs to the console once the statement in the **main()** is executed.

This C++ code identifies two uses: **int n**, which comes from the user(**n**), and **result_out**, which is displayed in the console to receive the user's input.

Output parameters (Pointers, references, or Optional) determine what is to be produced by a function (method or process).

Input Parameters (Pointers, references, or Optional) determines what to be given a function(method or process) to execute. The inputs are also known as **arguments** and specifies the data or the parameters that are available for use by a program or function

With this overview of the input and outputs, a summary of the primary functions and executions is gathered from the C++ code provided here.

The input being taken is an integer, **n**, where the number is defined in **main()**. The **main()** function takes as an argument n, which is used to call the **isPossible()** function together with the number and the complement of **n**. The prime number math functions **isPrime** and the condition **bool** and test **isPossible** determines if the result is true or false. The result is then given an output; either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the input's properties.

It is essential to analyze the code from a perspective that does not evaluate specific functions but changes the logic of these functions. To understand issues with complicated functions, crossover phases between functions, access concerns, task scheduling, timing, communication, sequence flows, at least 3-4 levels. This is useful for threading, parallel programming.

Although the code above is extensively symbolic, owing to its fault type, it remains to understand the key and the tool used to implement the function **isPossible(N)**. Process names, sensors, producers, as well as performers, self-description, guard, logs, stored/cached elements, as well as their interaction are to be identified by changing from a human to a computer logic perspective.

Eventually, everything regarding a particular process runs well depends on the design of the logic tree used to evaluate. A title defines a process that narrows things down independently of what does that method-specific problem solve.

In any case, the title of a process may be unpredictable to the individual and doesn't contain a return statement due to that function returning a positive number for a method to execute if further manipulation is apparent. In a summary, on the other hand, other parameters hold constant while a variable call is implemented without processing changes in the process tree to be evaluated within the method is the return statement.

The output is output_bool, returning a Boolean answer, then comparing to answer – true for successful execution, false, should other error occur. This tool can be utilized to carry out operations, including using a conditional sentence that depends on the deemed answer, so that a response to the output or return value is given. This means that the out parameter can be changed. The out-parameter can also be quite configurable to suit certain native needs or settings.

In general, such a process in the sense that the name of the program calls a method of the logic tree. After being validated, mainly due to input parameters and not the main function, is then depicted by the knowledge of what is in the tree. Programmatic filtering is taken into account so as to explain how a decision tree designed is utilized to save resources, increase workflow accuracy, and provide approaches to handle information across parallel computing. Another set of criteria is also applied by switching to a programming structure. In this case, a method depends on a port number that is associated to a class that depends on an iterated substring. The sum of a dilation iteration standard value is intrinsic to the elasticity and allows to limit license or handle applicable input parameters among constituent methods. These include a method for calculating a prime in itself, one for its opposite being rejected by the fifth, and the third is a particular case. The outcome is to print either 'yes' or 'no' based. The produced result from the program can then be assessed.

It is fully possible to describe a method and return an ideal answer within the formalities detailed above. A logical statement or method statement returns control to the current statement in which it has been placed in the logic buffer, allowing it to be executed. In the case when the number is a prime, it is tried for completeness as the sum of two divide factors might always be more than N and the final N can be the right value if used as a quote. The accumulated feedback from the tree can be used to check for a normal exit condition with no fail to accomplish the same. The software' procedure can be analyzed, changed, extended for better design and innovation, and final confirmation for best practices.

The code should be changed since it is ideal to learn how a C++ compliant design is extended. For example, exceptions can be implemented to handle failures. Additionally, logging and handling errors can be used to increase the I/O efficiency through process should something bad happen. After Software Change Survey processing, in-design change using an analysis on the actual design, testing in an algorithmic process or structure-driven approach to provide solutions to complex methods, the extended code here should be given.

A deeper analysis of the code will include using the references and databases, standard constants, and the composite input categories to identify how best to generate results that need to be placed based on the existing code and also to take into account customizing for users' needs.

First, review the existing code. The aim is to better design salient and crucial components of the code project. With the understanding of the code development management, primary worries address common errors, inspect the logic flow of process through the application modeling, testing using appropriate environments, debugging with experiences, improvements deployment actions, and researching the objectives, the focused and desirable answer can be easily guided through the implemented requirements and feature.

Here is an example of trial code that may translate the code above, at least, it is recommended:

OUTPUT:

1. A parallel drive processes the possible values inputs and accumulates their sum information in the output marked in.

2. Definition of the mapper array of the fuction possible() to declare the return of at low level outputs dynamic arrays, dynamic arrays from the caller.
