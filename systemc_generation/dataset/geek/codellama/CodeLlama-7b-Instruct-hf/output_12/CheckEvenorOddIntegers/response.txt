  This C++ program explains how to use the modulo operator to determine whether a number is even or odd. The code checks whether a given integer is divisible by 2 by using the modulo operator; if the result is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.
The program takes a single integer as input through a variable called n. This integer is then subjected to a conditional judgment that tests whether it is even or odd using the modulo operator.

The code resides in the main() function, which is started when the program is executed. The integer n is defined on line 16. The real work is done in the modulo operator following if (n % 2 == 0) and else clauses. In the if (n % 2 == 0) clause, the Value is compared to 0 using the == operator. If they match (that is, if the remainder is 0 when dividing by 2), "Even" is printed on Line 19. On the other hand, if the remainder isn't 0 (i.e., the number is odd), "Odd" is printed on Line 21.

The code's Inputs are the number's Value and, the actual output, the appropriate word "Even" or "Odd" (if the number is even or odd). The output of the program is also an integer indicating whether the input number is even or odd.

The output variable, result_out, is the required output from the program, as defined by the provided test bench signals and variables. Line 16 stores the input number, and output result_out "even" or "odd" accordingly.


Add the following SystemC code that captures the original C++ logic:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Odd Number Checker
SC_MODULE(OddNumberChecker) {
    sc_in<int> number_in;
    sc_out<string> result_out;
    sc_in<int> n;

    SC_CTOR(OddNumberChecker) {
        SC_THREAD(run);
    }

    async_response run() {
        // If n is completely divisible by 2
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            result_out.write("Even");
        }

        // If n is NOT completely divisible by 2
        else {
            result_out.write("Odd");
        }
    }

    void checkIfOdd(int n) {
        // If n is completely divisible by 2
        if (n == 0) {
            cout << "Even";
        }

        // If n is NOT completely divisible by 2
        else {
            cout << "Odd";
        }
    }
};
```
SystemC vocabulary is used in this function to inspect and sensitize on data arrivals and signals that specify the inputs and outputs. This code is compiled with a SystemC compiler and used in a system-level flow either.
