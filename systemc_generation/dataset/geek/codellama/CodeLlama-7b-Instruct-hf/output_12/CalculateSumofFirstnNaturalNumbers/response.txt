  C++/C Code

This C++ program will calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers where n is an integer input.

INPUTS:
1. An integer 'n'.

OUTPUT:
result, an integer representing the sum of the first n natural numbers.

Whether you analyze the code line by line or block by block, the inputs and outputs in the program are obvious because of the variable names. The findSum(int n) function takes an integer 'n' as input . The function calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers and returns the sum as an integer. The sum is returned as an integer.

The 'main()' function is the driver code. It takes 'n' as an input and passes it to 'findSum()'. The 'n' variable is declared as an 'int' with the value 5.

Flow of the Code:

1. The main() function first calculates the result using the findSum function.

2. After calculating result, it prints it to the console.

3. Once the program terminates properly, it directs the result to the console.

Block by Block Analysis of Code

The code consists of the following sections:

1. The preprocessor directive, which tells the compiler to accept the C++ program when run.

2. Importing 'iostream' libraries.

3. Using the 'using namespace std' directive to improve code readability.

4. Definition of 'findSum()' function to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers.

5. 'main()' function whose role is to act as the driver code.

6. The variable 'n' is declared and assigned the value 5, which is an integer input.

7. The findSum(int n) function is called and the result is output to the console.

In conclusion, the C++ or C code sums the first n natural numbers and returns that value as an integer. The results are output to the console.
