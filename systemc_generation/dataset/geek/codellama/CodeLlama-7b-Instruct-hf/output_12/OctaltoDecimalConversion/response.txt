  This is a function that takes an octal number as input and returns its equivalent decimal value. The function works by using a while loop to extract the last digit of the octal number, multiplying it by the appropriate base value (which is 8^0 for the first iteration), and adding it to the decimal value. After each iteration, the base value is updated to 8 times the previous value. The function returns the decimal value when the while loop is finished.

Here's the equivalent SystemC code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

int octalToDecimal(int n) {
	int num = n;
	int dec_value = 0;
	int base = 1;
	int temp = num;
	while (temp) {
		int last_digit = temp % 10;
		temp = temp / 10;
		dec_value += last_digit * base;
		base = base * 8;
	}
	return dec_value;
}
```

Note that this code uses input/output ports, which are used to create a compilable snippet. The ports are defined as shown above, and the module declaration is included for completeness.
