  **Inputs:**

* A vector of integers `arr` with length `n`, which represents the array that needs to be sorted.
* An integer `n`, which is the length of the array `arr`.

**Outputs:**

* A sorted vector of integers `arr`.

**Explanation:**

The provided C++ code is an implementation of the "selection sort" algorithm, which is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively finding the smallest element in an unsorted subarray, swapping it with the first element of the subarray, and repeating the process until the whole array is sorted.

The code begins by including the necessary libraries and defining a few functions, including `swap`, which is used to swap two integers and `selectionSort`, which is the function that performs the actual sorting.

The `selectionSort` function takes two inputs: `arr`, which is a vector of integers that represents the array to be sorted, and `n`, which is the length of the array `arr`. The function then loops over every element in the unsorted part of the array, from the first element to the last one.

For each element, the function finds the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array (using a nested loop) and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part using the `swap` function. The `min_idx` variable keeps track of the index of the smallest element found so far.

Once the smallest element is found and swapped with the first element, the loop iterates to the next element in the unsorted part of the array (since the first element has been sorted), and the process continues until all the elements in the unsorted part of the array have been sorted.

After the sorting is complete, the `printArray` function is called to print out the sorted array.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

//Vector of integers for the array
sc_in<int> arr;
//Vector of integers for the array
sc_in<int> n;
//Output port for the sorted array
sc_out<int> sorted_arr;

//Function to swap two integers
void swap(int *xp, int *yp) {
  int temp = *xp;
  *xp = *yp;
  *yp = temp;
}

//Function to perform selection sorting
void selectionSort(int arr[], int n) {
  int i, j, min_idx;

  //Loop over every element in the unsorted part of the array
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    //Find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array
    min_idx = i;
    for (j = i+1; j < n; j++)
      if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx])
        min_idx = j;

    //Swap the found minimum element with the first element
    swap(&arr[min_idx], &arr[i]);
  }

  //Output the sorted array
  sorted_arr.write(arr);
}

int main() {
  //Call selectionSort function
  selectionSort(arr, n);

  //Print the sorted array
  sc_cout << "Sorted array: ";
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    sc_cout << arr[i] << " ";
  sc_cout << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
In the SystemC code, the `arr` and `n` input ports are connected to the `arr` and `n` inputs of the `selectionSort` function, respectively. The `selectionSort` function performs the sorting and outputs the sorted array to the `sorted_arr` output port.

The `main` function simply calls the `selectionSort` function and prints out the sorted array.
