  Based on the provided C++/C program, the inputs are:

* A principal amount, P, of type float.
* A rate of interest, R, of type float.
* A time, T, of type float.

The outputs are:

* A simple interest, SI, also of type float.

The program calculates SI by multiplying the principal amount, P, by the time, T, and then dividing the result by 100.

To generate the equivalent SystemC code, we will need to create a SystemC integer module that takes in the inputs and outputs as specified above.

Here is an example of how we could create this integer module in SystemC:
```c
#include <systemc.h>

// Module for calculating simple interest
SC_MODULE(SimpleInterest) {
    // Input ports for the principal amount and rate of interest
    sc_in<float> P;
    sc_in<float> R;

    // Output port for the simple interest
    sc_out<float> SI;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SimpleInterest) {
        // Process to calculate simple interest
        SC_METHOD(calculate_si);
        sensitive << P << R;
    }

    // Method to calculate simple interest
    void calculate_si() {
        SI.write((P * T * R) / 100);
    }
};
```
In this example, we define a module called `SimpleInterest` that takes in three inputs (P, R, and T) and outputs one value (SI). The module contains a process (calculate_si) that calculates SI by multiplying P, T, and R as specified in the original C++/C code and then dividing the result by 100.

To make this module compatible with the existing SystemC testbench, we need to include the `P`, `R`, and `T` signals to the module as input ports and the `SI` signal as an output port. We can do this by adding the following code after the definition of the `SimpleInterest` module:
```c
void initial() {
    SI.write(0.0f);
}

extern "C" int main() {
    PC.write(1.0f);
    RC.write(1.0f);
    TC.write(1.0f);
    wait();
    main.finish();
    return 0;
}
```
This code defines an initial process that initializes the `SI` signal to 0.0. It also defines a main function that takes in the `P`, `R`, and `T` signals as input and assigns them to the `P`, `R`, and `T` variables, respectively, before calling the `calculate_si` method to calculate and assign the `SI` value.

With this code, we can integrate this SystemC module with the existing SystemC testbench and validate that it produces the same output as the original C++/C code.
