  Given the C++/C code, the inputs and outputs of the code are:
* The input(s) are an integer n and a declaration
* The output(s) is(are) the binary number of n.

The top part of the code, including the function `decToBinary`, is used to convert a user-inputed string to a binary string. The function is defined as void and takes an integer value. The variable `binaryNum[32]` is a static array used to store the binary code of the inputted string while the variable `i` is an index value for the binary numerical system.

The while loop inside the function is used to iterate through the whole binary numerical system. Each time the loop cycle is concluded, the program looks up and outputs the binary representation of the number to be converted. For example, if the input string is 10, the binary representation of 10 is 1010.

The bottom part of the code, which goes to declaring the \`main()\` function, is where the program starts. Inputs to the program are required (in this case, an interger). The binary code of the user-inputted integer will be displayed after converting the string via the decToBinary function.


Here is the equivalent SystemC code;
```scss
int main(void){ 
    sc_signal<bool> binary_output; 
    int dec_input_num;
    decToBinary(dec_input_num); 
    binary_output = dec_input_num; 
} 
```
This line of code makes several decisions about the inputs, outputs, and behavior, based on the previously presented code.

An input (int) is required from the user to obtain its binary equivalent; the user needs to input a decimal number.

The `decToBinary` function takes the input parameter as an integer and returns a binary string representation that the `binary_output` signal can read and write.  

The rest of the code is clear and understandable.
