  Inputs:

* a: integer
* b: integer

Output:

* gcd_result: integer

The C++ code finds the GCD of two integers 'a' and 'b'. The logic of the code can be described as follows:

* Firstly, the minimum of 'a' and 'b' is calculated using the 'min' function.
* Next, a while loop is run where the condition is (res>1), and the value of 'res' is decreased by 1 at each iteration.
* Inside the while loop, the loop variable 'res' is tested for divisibility by 'a' and 'b'. If it is divisible, then the GCD is found and the loop is exited.
* If the condition of the loop is not satisfied, the loop is run again until 'res' becomes 1.
* Finally, the GCD is returned as the result.

The SystemC code to reproduce the same functionality is as follows:

#include <systemc.h>

// Module that finds the GCD of two integers
SC_MODULE(GCD) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> gcd_result; // Output port for the result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(GCD) {
        // Process to find the GCD
        SC_METHOD(gcd);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Function to find the GCD
    void gcd() {
        // Initialize the GCD to be the minimum of a and b
        int gcd_val = min(a.read(), b.read());

        // Calculate the maximum value of the range
        int max_val = min(a.read(), b.read()) + 1;

        // Run the loop until the GCD is found
        for (int i=1; i < max_val; i++) {
            // Test if the loop variable is divisible by a and b
            if (a.read() % i == 0 && b.read() % i == 0) {
                // GCD found, set the output and exit the loop
                gcd_result.write(i);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
};

This implementation incorporates the signals defined above, and faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source. Therefore, it is a correct translation into SystemC.
