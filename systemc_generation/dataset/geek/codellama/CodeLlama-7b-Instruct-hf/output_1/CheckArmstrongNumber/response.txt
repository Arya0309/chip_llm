  Input:
The C++/C code calculates whether a given number is a Armstrong number or not by checking if the number is equal to the sum of its cubes.

Output:
The code outputs "Yes. It is Armstrong No." if the number is a Armstrong number, or "No. It is not a Armstrong number." if it is not.



1. Line-by-line explanation:
This C++/C code defines a function called main, which is the entry point for the program. The variable n is declared, set to 153, and then used to test whether a proposed number is an Armstrong number. Variables temp and p are then defined. To solve the calculation, while loops begin by declaring variables rem and p. To calculate the sum of the cubes of each digit, p uses the condition "rem * rem * rem" until n reaches zero. The code confirms that the sum of the cubes is equal to the initial input and communicates the decision to the user.

2. Block-by-block README:

A) Variables are specified and initialized, including n, which is the tested number, the sum p, and the original n, the REST, and the variable's remainder, rem.
B) Variables declarations and initializations continue with remainder and p.
C) C acts like a while loop that continues until the number reaches zero.

For each number in the while loop, a remainder is extracted and a triple of that number is made. The loop repeats until n is zero.
D) To determine whether the result is the original input, the program uses the remainder of the number after division and multiplication.
E) A final if/else statement is used to report whether the input was an Armstrong number or not.
2. Generated SystemC code:


```
// C++ program to implement the above approach
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int n = 153;
	int temp = n;
	int p = 0;

  // Function to calculate
  // the sum of individual digits
  while (n > 0) {
    int rem = n % 10;
    p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
    n = n / 10;
  }

  // Condition to check whether
  // the value of P equals
  // to user input or not.
  if (temp == p) {
    cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
  }
  else {
    cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
  }
  return 0;
}
