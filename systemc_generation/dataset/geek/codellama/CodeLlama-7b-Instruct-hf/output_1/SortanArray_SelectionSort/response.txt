  This C++ program implements the selection sort algorithm, which is a simple sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted array and moves it to the front of the array. The program has three main functions: `swap`, `selectionSort`, and `printArray`. The `swap` function takes two integer pointers as input and swaps the values at the corresponding locations in the arrays. The `selectionSort` function sorts the array by looping over the array from 0 to `n-1` and finding the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array using a nested loop. It then swaps the smallest element in the unsorted part with the first element in the same loop. The `printArray` function takes an array and its size as input and prints the contents of the array to the console.

The inputs of this program are the integer array `arr` and its size `n`, which are defined in `main`. The outputs are the sorted array `arr` and the modified `n` variable, which is used to maintain the size of the array.

Here is a line-by-line natural language explanation of the C++ code:

1. The first line includes the `stdc++` library, which contains many useful tools and functions for writing C++ programs.
2. The second and third lines use the `namespace` keyword to create a new namespace called `std` for importuning useful functions and types from the `stdc++` library.
3. The `swap` function takes two integer pointers as input and swaps the values at the corresponding locations in the arrays.
4. The `selectionSort` function sorts the array by looping over the array from 0 to `n-1` and finding the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array using a nested loop. It then swaps the smallest element in the unsorted part with the first element in the same loop.
5. The `printArray` function takes an array and its size as input and prints the contents of the array to the console.
6. The `main` function is the entry point of the program and defines the integer arrays `arr` and `n`, which are used as inputs to the `selectionSort` function and as an output from the `printArray` function.
7. In the `main` function, the `selectionSort` function is called with `arr` and `n` as inputs, and the sorted array `arr` is used as an output to the `printArray` function.

Here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that maps to the functionality of the original C++/C code:
```scss
#include "systemc.h"

typedef struct {
    int arr[5]; // assuming arr is only 5 integers
    int n;
} my_data_t;

SC_MODULE(selectionSort) {
    sc_in<my_data_t> data_in;  // inputs for the selection sort function
    sc_out<my_data_t> data_out; // outputs for the selection sort function

    SC_CTOR(selectionSort) {
        SC_METHOD(selectionSort_wrapper);
        sensitive << data_in.arr;
    }

    void selectionSort_wrapper() {
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            // find the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array
            int min_idx = i;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) {
                    min_idx = j;
                }
            }
            // swap the smallest element with the first element
            swap(&arr[min_idx], &arr[i]);
        }
        // output the sorted array
        data_out.write(n, arr);
    }

    void swap(int *xp, int *yp) {
        int temp = *xp;
        *xp = *yp;
        *yp = temp;
    }
}
```

The `my_data_t` struct is defined in the SystemC code to match the input and output arrays of the selection sort function with SystemC's `sc_in` and `sc_out` ports. The `selectionSort` module takes an `sc_in` port for the input data, an `sc_out` port for the output data, and the `swap` function is defined within the module. The `selectionSort_wrapper` method performs the actual selection sort functionality, which is similar to the original `selectionSort` function in the C++/C code. The `n` variable is passed through the `data_out` port for the sorted array size.

The summary of the C++/C code is:
* The program takes an integer array `arr` and its size `n` as inputs.
* The `selectionSort` function sorts the array by finding the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array, swapping it with the first element, and repeating this process for each remaining unsorted element.
* The `printArray` function takes the sorted array `arr` and its size `n` as inputs and outputs the contents of the array to the console.
* The program uses the `swap` function to swap the elements of the array.
* The `main` function is the entry point of the program and calls the `selectionSort` function with the input arrays `arr` and `n`, then calls the `printArray` function with the sorted array `arr` and its size `n`.

The equivalent SystemC code is:
* The `selectionSort` module takes an `sc_in` port for the input data and an `sc_out` port for the output data.
* The `selectionSort_wrapper` method performs the actual selection sort functionality, which is similar to the original `selectionSort` function in the C++/C code.
* The `swap` function is defined within the module.
* The `n` variable is passed through the `data_out` port for the sorted array size.
* The `printArray` function is not necessary in the SystemC code, as the sorted array size `n` is already included in the output data port.
