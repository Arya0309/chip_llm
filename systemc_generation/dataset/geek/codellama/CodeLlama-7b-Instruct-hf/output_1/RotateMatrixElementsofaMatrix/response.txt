  C++/C Code
-------

The provided C++/C code is a program that rotates a square matrix by 90 degrees counterclockwise. The program takes a matrix as input and modifies the matrix in place.

Summary
-------

The provided C++/C code is a function named `rotatematrix` that rotates a square matrix by 90 degrees counterclockwise. The matrix is represented as a 2D array of integers, with dimensions `R` and `C`. The function takes the array `mat` and its dimensions `m` and `n` as inputs. It then rotates the matrix by iterating through each row, column, and corner of the matrix and shifting the elements accordingly. The function stores the first element of the next row in a temporary variable, moves elements from the remaining rows, columns, and corners, and finally swaps the elements.

Identified Inputs and Outputs
---------------------------

### Inputs

* `mat`: A 2D array of integers representing the square matrix to be rotated.
* `m` and `n`: The dimensions of the `mat` array.

### Output

* None, as the matrix is modified in place.

SystemC Code
------------

```c++
#include <systemc>

// Module that rotates a square matrix by 90 degrees counterclockwise
SC_MODULE(MatrixRotator) {
    // Input port for the matrix to be rotated
    sc_in<int> in;

    // Output port for the rotated matrix
    sc_out<int> out;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatrixRotator) {
        // Process to rotate the matrix
        SC_METHOD(rotate_matrix);
        sensetive << in;
    }

    // Method to rotate the matrix
    void rotate_matrix() {
        // Declare variables to store the elements of the matrix
        int prev, curr;

        // Rotate the matrix by iterating through each row, column, and corner
        for (int row = 0; row < m; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
                // Store the first element of the next row in a temporary variable
                prev = mat[row + 1][col];

                // Move elements from the remaining rows
                for (int i = col; i < n; i++) {
                    curr = mat[row][i];
                    mat[row][i] = prev;
                    prev = curr;
                }
            }

            // Move elements from the remaining columns
            for (int i = row; i < m; i++) {
                curr = mat[i][n - 1];
                mat[i][n - 1] = prev;
                prev = curr;
            }
        }

        // Rotate the matrix by iterating through each corner
        for (int row = m - 1; row >= 0; row--) {
            for (int col = n - 1; col >= 0; col--) {
                curr = mat[row][col];
                mat[row][col] = prev;
                prev = curr;
            }
        }

        // Print the rotated matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                cout << mat[i][j] << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
};
```

In the SystemC code above, we define a module named `MatrixRotator` that takes an `int` input `in` and an `int` output `out`. The module has a process `rotate_matrix` that iterates through each row, column, and corner of the matrix and shifts the elements accordingly. The process stores the first element of the next row in the temporary variable `prev`, moves elements from the remaining rows and columns, and finally swaps the elements.

The `MatirxRotator` module is constructed with a constructor that calls the `rotate_matrix` process and makes the input port `in` sensitive to changes. The `rotate_matrix` process acts on the `in` port and modifies the `out` port. The `out` port is then printed to the console.

To use the `MatrixRotator` module in a synthesizable flow, we need to provide a functional interface that allows other modules to call the `rotate_matrix` process. We can provide a simple wrapper module, `MatrixRotatorWrapper`, that implements the functionality required for high-level synthesis:
```
#include <systemc>

// A wrapper module for the MatrixRotator module
SC_MODULE(MatrixRotatorWrapper) {
    // Input signals
    sc_in<int> in[SIZE]; // The matrix to be rotated

    // Output signals
    sc_out<int> out[SIZE]; // The rotated matrix

    // Declare an instance of the MatrixRotator module
    MatrixRotator<SIZE> rotator;

    // Connect the input and output signals
    rotator.in(in);
    rotator.out(out);

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatrixRotatorWrapper) {
        // Call the rotate_matrix method
        SC_METHOD(rotate_matrix);
        sensetive << rotator;
    }

    // Call the rotate_matrix process
    void rotate_matrix() {
        // Call the rotate_matrix method for the rotator module
        rotator.rotate_matrix();
    }
};
```
In the `MatrixRotatorWrapper` module above, we define a `MatrixRotator` instance named `rotator` and connect its input and output signals to the `in` and `out` arrays, respectively. We then define a constructor and a call to the `rotate_matrix` method for the `rotator` module to run the process and rotate the matrix. We implement a `rotate_matrix` method that calls the `rotate_matrix` method of the `rotator` object. By connecting the `rotator` module to our high-level synthesis flow, we can run the `rotate_matrix` process on the input matrix and get the rotated matrix as output.

The provided SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow to rotate a square matrix by 90 degrees counterclockwise.
