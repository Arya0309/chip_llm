  This C++/C code snippet calculates the sum of two complex numbers. The program defines a class called Complex with attribute real, imaginary, and a constructor method to assign these values. Method addComp calculates the sum of two complex numbers. Finally, the main() function demonstrates how to use two Complex numbers as inputs and return the sum as outputs. To maintain the logic of this logic, the equivalent SystemC code below is an additive adder port using C++/SC.

The additive adder has two inputs P and Q and one output SUM. P and Q are both integer vectors with two elements each.

The DUT logic assumes that the inputs P and Q are both n integer (n is the number of bits used to represent the multiplicand). Also, since both inputs are vectors, the output is also a vector, with the same dimensions as P (n). The functional verification DUT uses two inputs P and Q with n bits, a multiplier module, and a carry-over module to perform the multiplication in S/W and verifies the results. The clock period is divided into w clock cycles, where w is the rounded number of clock cycles required for the operation to complete.

In summary, using the inputs (P, Q), the DUT computes the sum of the complex numbers (P + Q) and returns as an output vector (SUM) that is represented in a 2â€™s complement format.

Note: The SystemC design should be transformed for good placement, routing, and optimization for the processors listed (for example, generic Sinvelect, MAS, and OpenMP).
