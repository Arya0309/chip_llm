  This is a C++/C code that can be converted into SystemC code to perform a conversion from octal to decimal. The code is included in the provided system. The main input of the code is an octal number, and the output is the decimal number produced by the conversion operation. The inbound and outbound signals were specified above.

Firstly, the program calculates the decimal equivalent of a non-positive integer's octal representation. We do this by determining the numerical values of the digits in the octal number by simply multiplying the number's digits by 8 to the power of the digit's location, starting with zero. We then compare the resulting values and add them up.


```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to convert octal to decimal
int octalToDecimal(int n)
{
	int num = n;
	int dec_value = 0;
 
	// Initiate base value at 1, i.e 8^0
	int base = 1;

	int temp = num;

// Loop through the octal number
	while (temp){
		// Obtain the digit in the last place
		int last_digit = temp % 10;
		temp = temp / 10;
 
		// Multiply the last digit by the appropriate base value
		// and add it to the dec_value
		dec_value += last_digit * base;

		base = base * 8;
	}

	return dec_value;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int num = 67;

	cout << octalToDecimal(num) << endl;
}
```

Conversion steps:
- Declare num to store the octal input.
- Determine base for the conversion and initialize it to 1 (8^0).
- Copy num to temp.
- Iterate through the digits in the octal number and:
 g- Obtain each digit at a time in the last place by appending %10. It extract the last digit We calculate the product with the appropriate base value, which is initialized to 8 (8^0).
 instead of storing it directly, multiply each digit by its position's power of 8.
- 7*8^1 + 6*8^0= 7*64+6*1 = 464+6= 510.
- Multiply the sum of the last digits by the previously stored base, mostly 8, and save it in the decimal equivalent's multiplication.
- Reach the final result by recursively performing the same tasks.
- After all recursive calculations, return the product, which is the decimal equivalent. The constraint will return its decimal equivalent.
- Use the numerical value output by the computer to represent the actual decimal equivalent of the specific octal input as shown in the output.


```
SystemC Conversion:
#include <systemc.h>

// Interface for the conversion function
sc_interface octalToDecimal(sc_in<int> n);

// Interface for the result function

sc_out<int> decimal_output;

/* Function to convert octal to decimal
//      */

SC_MODULE(octalToDecimal)
{
	sc_in<int> n;  // Input port for the octal number
	sc_out<int> dec_value; // Output port for the decimal equivalent

	// Constructor
	SC_CTOR(Adder)
	{
		SC_METHOD(add)
		sensitive << n;
	}

	// Method to add the two numbers
	void add()
	{
		decimal_output.write(n.read());
	}
};

// Driver code
int main()
{
	sc_signal<int> num;

	cout << octal_to_Decimal.decimal_output << endl;
}
