  This C++ program is named transpose, and it can be used to find the transpose of a 4-by-4 matrix.

The output displays the transposed matrix.

A structure is predefined into the main function (an int2D array is used to store the matrix). We will store the transposed matrix in another int2D array that is passed to the transpose function whose job it is to calculate the transposed matrix.

transpose(int A[][N], int B[][N])

* Start reading ini place matrices A and B into the transpose function
* For the transpose function the input matrix A is a 2D array that we decay to a pointer A is then converted into an integer pointer. We do this by enjecting this value into a temp array of 4 integers. By treating our two dimensional pointers in this way we can traverse the two dimensional array having as a result a contiguous array that we could treat as an integral array
* We start by passing the starting index and a row input through all loops for two dimensional arrays.
* We use three loops as arguments to pass the starting index and the row. Next, a second matrix B is referenced into memory as the variable B. This declaration is at the *function scope.
* The boundary of the array B is then determined by index boundaries; the loop is better executed until this terminates integer memories. We of course cannot as a result traverse anything outside the declared array. For this purpose we obtained the lengths of array B and A and ran the row over the defined size of B array. We start by preserving the index into our loop as i. We then employ two nested loops that advance the pointer from the first axis by one unit. We use another nested loop to traverse this pointer range to access the elements in the other axis. Here, we are able to traverse this url as a range because the rows have from 0 to N-1 values in the universe we define.
* We then write the element at our B from the matrix A beside the index into our new dimensions. Preserving our pointer organization we are able to do this from B by iterating the sum of elements in the previous row and row where we write a scalar to the result into the value at the index. We write the elements in our matrix B, that means, the sum array, eg, matrix B into the indice. Array A, index array B, we initialize from a with 0 at the beginning of each dimension, so the first front is 0, while the last is N-1. Next, we use pass our convuluted matrices A and B to pointer to the output parameter.

The program consists of the following four blocks: 
* Void
* Temporary
* Accessor 
* Transpose algorithm
* The function transpose executes C++ blocks in a given order as shown below:
* We start with Temporary which yields an int2D array that is the same as the given start values or original inputs. The next block is the transpose function. The outputs of the transpose function of an input matrix A will yield a matrix B that is a transposed output matrix.
* The transpose function uses Algorithm transpose to traverse the input matrix and store the outputs in a different matrix or output matrix.
* Finally, we have the Driver code which first creates the input and output matrices stores the transposed matrix there and after displaying it outputs it.

The SystemC code generated mirrors the logic of the given C++/C example. SystemC has a composer component that enables synthesis and simulation. I have used the sc_in and sc_out keywords to define inputs and outputs, respectively. I have defined the size of the matrix. Sensitivity analysis determines how scenarios cause updates of a designated block.

The driver module contains an input and output port in the fashion of SystemC to facilitate transforming the behaviour authorization.
