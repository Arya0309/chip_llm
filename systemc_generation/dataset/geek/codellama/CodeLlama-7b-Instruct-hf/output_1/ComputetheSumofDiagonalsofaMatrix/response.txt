Question:We have been given a C++/C code that finds the sum of the diagonals of a matrix. We must critique the code and generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet.

Please describe the inputs and outputs of the code.

The input is a n x n matrix of integers, and the program prints the principal diagonal sum and the secondary diagonal sum.

Please explain what the code does by describing each line or block

The for loop initializes the principal and secondary diagonals to zero. Inside the loop, a nested for loop is used to iterate through the rows and columns of the matrix.
If the current row and column are the same, the principal diagonal condition is satisfied and the current diagonal element is added to the principal diagonal sum.
If the current row minus current column is the size of the matrix minus one, the secondary diagonal condition is satisfied, and the current diagonal element is added to the secondary diagonal sum.
 After iterating through each element of the matrix, the program prints the principal and secondary diagonal sums.

Provide an equivalent SystemC code snippet.

#include <systemc.h>

// Module to sum diagonals of a matrix
SC_MODULE(DiagonalSum) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[100]; // Input port for the matrix
    sc_out<int> principal; // Output port for the principal diagonal sum
    sc_out<int> secondary; // Output port for the secondary diagonal sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSum) {
        // Process to sum diagonals
        SC_METHOD(sum);
        sensitive << matrix;
    }

    // Method to sum diagonals
    void sum() {
        int principal = 0;
        int secondary = 0;
        int row, col;
        for (row = 0; row < 100; row++) {
            for (col = 0; col < 100; col++) {
                if (row == col) {
                    // Current element is on the principal 
                    // diagonal. Increment principal sum.
                    principal += matrix[row * 100 + col];
                } else if (int((row + col) - 1) == 100 - 1) { 
                    // Current element is on the secondary 
                    // diagonal. Increment secondary sum.
                    secondary += matrix[row * 100 + col];
                }
            }
        }
        principal.write(principal);
        secondary.write(secondary);
    }
};

The process would perform a forward (or backward) traversal of the matrix. There is no distinction between the main and secondary diagonals in the generalized code, but different variations might be created depending on the application.

Better focus on smoothing during the process rather than stabilizing its final state.
