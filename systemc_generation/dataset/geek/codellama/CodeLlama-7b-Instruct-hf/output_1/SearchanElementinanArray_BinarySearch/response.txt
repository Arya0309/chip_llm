  C++/C Program for Iterative Binary Search
=====================

This C++/C program implements an iterative binary search algorithm. The program takes two inputs: a vector v of integers and a target integer. The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the target element is found in the vector.

Inputs
------

* v: The input vector to be searched.
* target: The target element to search for.

Output
-------

* found: Boolean indicating whether the target element is found in the vector.

Block Diagram
--------------

The program consists of two main blocks: a while loop and a if statement. The while loop continues searching for the target element until the low and high indices are not equal, indicating that the target element must be within the range between low and high. The if statement checks whether the middle element of the vector equal to the target element. If it is, the search terminates and the method returns true. If not, the program checks whether the middle element is greater than the target element. If it is, the search switches to the right half of the vector. Otherwise, it is necessary to search the left half of the vector. The program continues to search the left half until the middle element is equal to the target element or low is larger than high.

SystemC Implementation
----------------------

The generated SystemC code should not only reflect the logic of the original C++/C source but also utilize the predefined signals (target and found) so it can integrate seamlessly with our existing testbench. The SystemC code should include a module for the binary search and a main module that provides the input and output. The system code should be written in a way that the main module can call the binary search module. The binary search module should be included in the system code through the use of the Processing Unit concept.

java
```
#include <cplex.h>
class add {
private: int c = 0;

public:
void add(int i) {
      c = c + i;
    }
};

int main( int argc, char *argv[] ) {

  int i;

  bc.add(i);
}
```

sys.h

```
// modules are straightforwardly extracted from a software design in 
// SystemC by breaking them down into simpler components or 
// subroutines, and then wiring them together.

#include "add.h" 
#include "sub.h" // To subtract variables,



SC_MODULE(binary_search) {
    // modules can be created as a conjunction of smaller,
    // self-contained components (processes, units, and modules)

    // The basic process or unit of a module.
    SC_MODULE(top) {
      sc_signal<bool> f;  // Input port.
      sc_signal<bool> g;  // Output port.
      SC_CTOR(top):f(), g() {}

      void stimulus();  // Stimulus, to drive the input.
      void watcher();   // Response, to examine the output.
    };

    // An add module processes input streams and produces output streams using internal variables. 
    SC_MODULE(add) {
      sc_signal<int> a;  // Input port.
      sc_signal<int> b;  // Input port.
      sc_signal<int> c;  // Output port.
      SC_CTOR(add):a(), b(), c() {}

      void stimulus();  // Stimulus, to drive the input.
      void watcher();   // Response, to examine the output.
    };
