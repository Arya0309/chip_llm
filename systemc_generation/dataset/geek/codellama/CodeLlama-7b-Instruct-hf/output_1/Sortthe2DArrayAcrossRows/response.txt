  Inputs:
The C++/C code takes in two inputs: a 2D array m of dimension n x m, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns, and an integer r representing the number of rows in the matrix.

Outputs:
The C++/C code outputs a sorted 2D array of dimension n x m, where the rows are sorted in ascending order.

Natural Language Summary:
The code sorts the input 2D array row-wise, meaning that it sorts the elements in each row independently. The code utilizes a bubble sort algorithm to accomplish this. The outermost for loop iterates over the rows of the matrix, while the nested inner for loop iterates over the columns of each row, and the third inner for loop iterates over the elements within a single row. The swap function, which swaps the values of two elements, is used to sort the elements in each column. The algorithm continues until the matrix has been fully sorted. In addition to sorting the matrix, the code also prints the sorted matrix.

SystemC Summary:
The corresponding SystemC code should incorporate the signals defined above. The module should have the following ports:

*a: an input port for a 2D array of dimension n x m, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns.
*r: an input port representing the number of rows in the matrix.
*done: an output port that indicates if the sort has been completed.

The module should have the following signals:

*m: a 2D array signal of dimension n x m, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns.
*c: an integer signal representing the number of columns in the matrix.
*r: an integer signal representing the number of rows in the matrix.

The system should have the following processes:

*sortRowWise: a method that sorts a 2D array of dimension n x m row-wise.
*printMat: a method that prints a sorted 2D array of dimension n x m.

The sortRowWise method should have the following process items:

*for (int i = 0; i < r; i++): iterate over the rows of the matrix.
*for (int j = 0; j < c; j++): iterate over the columns of a single row.
*for (int k = 0; k < c - j - 1; k++): iterate over the elements within a single row, starting from the first element and continuing until the second-to-last element.
*if (m[i][k] > m[i][k + 1]): check if the current element is greater than the next element.
*swap(m[i][k], m[i][k + 1]): swap the values of the current element and the next element if necessary.
*printMat: a function that prints a sorted 2D array of dimension n x m.

The following constraints apply to the SystemC code:

*The SystemC code must be compiled as part of an high-level synthesis flow and be integrated with an existing testbench.
*The SystemC code must be able to handle inputs of arbitrary size.
*The SystemC code should be modular, with each module performing a specific function.

Hence, based on the above analysis, the following SystemC code can be generated:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CppSort) {
	// Inputs
	sc_in<int> m;
	sc_in<int> r;

	}

	// The sortRowWise method
	void sortRowWise(int n, int m, int c) {
		// Sort the matrix row-wise
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
				for (int k = 0; k < c - j - 1; k++) {
					if (m[i][k] > m[i][k + 1]) {
						swap(m[i][k], m[i][k + 1]);
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}

	// The printMat method
	void printMat(int n, int m) {
		// Print the sorted matrix
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
				cout << m[i][j] << " ";
			}
			cout << endl;
		}
	}
};
