  **Task 1: Read and Analyze the Code**

The provided C++/C code contains a function named `decToBinary` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a binary representation of `n` as an array of integers. The function works by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 and storing the remainder in a binary array, and then printing the array in reverse order.

**Tasks 2-4: Identify Inputs and Outputs**

* Inputs:
	+ A decimal number `n` (can be any positive integer).
* Output:
	+ A binary representation of `n` as an array of integers.

**Task 5: Detailed Natural Language Explanation**

The provided C++/C code has the following functionality:

* The `decToBinary` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a binary representation of `n` as an array of integers.
* The function works by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 and storing the remainder in a binary array.
* The binary array is printed in reverse order.

**Task 6: Generate Equivalent SystemC Code**

To translate the C++/C code to SystemC, we need to create a SystemC module that implements the same logic. Here's an example SystemC code that generates the same output as the provided C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// SystemC module for converting a decimal number to binary
SC_MODULE(decToBinary) {
    // Input and output signals
    sc_in<int> dec_in; // Input signal for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output signal for the binary number

    // Array to store binary number
    int binary_num[32];

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(decToBinary) {
        // Process to convert decimal to binary
        SC_METHOD(decode);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    // Method to convert decimal to binary
    void decode() {
        // Initialize the binary number array
        int i = 0;
        while (dec_in > 0) {
            // Store the remainder in the binary number array
            binary_num[i] = dec_in % 2;
            dec_in = dec_in / 2;
            i++;
        }

        // Print the binary number array in reverse order
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            binary_out.write(binary_num[j]);
        }
    }
};
```
This SystemC code uses the same approach as the C++/C code, where the `binary_num` array is used to store the binary representation of the input `dec_in`. The `decode` method is called when the input `dec_in` changes, which converts the decimal number to a binary number and stores it in the `binary_num` array. The `decode` method then prints the binary number array in reverse order, which is equivalent to the original C++/C code.

To ensure seamless integration with the testbench, the SystemC code includes the `dec_in` and `binary_out` signals, which are the same as the signals defined in the provided C++/C code. The testbench can then drive the `dec_in` signal with a stimulus and observe the output of the `binary_out` signal.
