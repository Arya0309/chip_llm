  This code is a C++ program that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The program takes an array of integers and its length as inputs, sorts the array, and outputs the sorted array.

The inputs to the code are:

* The array of integers to be sorted.
* The length of the array.

The outputs of the code are:

* The sorted array.

The code can be analyzed block-by-block as follows:

1. The `sort` function is the main function that sorts the array. It takes the array and its length as inputs and uses the bubble sort algorithm to sort the array.
2. The `swapNums` function is a helper function that swaps two elements in the array. It takes the array and two indices as inputs and swaps the elements at those indices.
3. The `sort` function is implemented in two parts. The first part runs n-1 steps, where n is the length of the array. For each step, the function checks if the current element is smaller than the previous one, and if so, it swaps the two elements using the `swapNums` function.
4. The second part of the `sort` function checks if there was a swap during the previous step, and if there was no swap, the function breaks out of the inner loop.
5. The `main` function is the driver code that initializes the array, calls the `sort` function, and outputs the sorted array.

The natural language summary of the code is as follows:

The code accepts an array of integers and its length as inputs, and it sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm. The `sort` function uses a bubble sort algorithm to sort the array. The function checks if the current element is smaller than the previous one, and if so, it swaps the two elements using the `swapNums` function. The code can be integrated with a high-level synthesis flow by using SystemC code that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source and utilizes the provided signals (or equivalent named ports) such as `clk`, `start`, and `done`.
