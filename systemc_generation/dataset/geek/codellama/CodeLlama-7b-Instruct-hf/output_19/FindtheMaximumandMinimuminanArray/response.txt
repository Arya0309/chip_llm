  This C++/C code anonymous function find the minimum or maximum value in an array.
The snippet requests an input (which is an array of values of integers) and another who responds with the minimum and maximum values in the array (the 'min_val' and 'max_val').
The program runs in the 'main' method, and it is stated that two functions, 'getMin' and 'getMax' are used to obtain the minimum and maximum values, respectively.
The program uses the '*min_element' and '*max_element' functions to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array. 
The '*min_element' and '*max_element' functions are defined in the C++ standard library and are used (similar to other languages) in the C program to find corresponding elements in an array. 
The program prints the minimum and maximum elements to the console using 'cout'.
