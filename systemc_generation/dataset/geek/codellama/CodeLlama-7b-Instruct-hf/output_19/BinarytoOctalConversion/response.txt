  This is a C++/C code snippet that converts an octal number to its decimal equivalent.  The program takes an octal number as input and returns its decimal equivalent as output. The goal is to share the original code and perform a leak-to-fix process. The outputs of the code are defined below:

* Input: A single integer, say X.  It should be input as octal via the octal_input signal.
* Output: The decimal equivalent of X. This output will need to be set by the decimal_output signal in SystemC.

The major lines and regions of the code appear below:

* The snippet first includes the information supplied above, as well as varios functions related to startup.
* The octalToDecimal function is the main entry point for translation. It begins by setting the num and deoc_value variables to the user's input, or OctalValue. Then, it assignes the initial value of 1 to the base variable, which is the power of astronomical of the factor of 8. The while loop continues to run while there are yet octal digits to process, that is, until temp is zero.  Within the loop, several actions are carried out. The first, the current decimal value of the number is calculated and added to the deoc_value variable. After computations, the value of temp is reduced by dividing by 10, whilst also using the value at the last octal digit by extracting its modulo 10. the value of temp becomes the next digit. After reducing temp by dividing by 10, system calculates the power of base, which is then multiplied by 8. This is then stored in base. Then, as it stands, the function returns the equation.
* The main code supplies the argument n from which the octaToDecimal function is executed.  It displays the return value given by the function on the console as a new line.

The equivalent SystemC code snippet based on this code will be demonstrated below.

```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that converts Octal Numbers Into Decimal Numbers 
SC_MODULE(octalAdder) {
    sc_in<int> addends[];  // Input ports for the two numbers to add
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the result of the addition
    
    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(octalAdder) {
        // Process for resulting addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
    sensitive << addends<<sum;
    }

    // Core process that performs addition
    void add() {
        int num1 = octal_input.read();
        int num2 = octal_input.read();
        int hexadecimal_value = 0;
        int base = decimalToOctal(num1);

        while (base) {

            // Extracting last octal digit.
            int last_digit = num2 % 8;
            num2 = num2 / 8;

            // Multiplying last digit with appropriate power of 8 
            // and adding it to base
            hexadecimal_value += last_digit * base;

            base = base * 8;
        }

        decimal_output.write(hexadecimal_value);
    }
}
int main() {

    octalAdder module1(region(0), region(0));

    sc_in<int> octal_input(region(0), module1.addends[0]);
    sc_out<int> decimal_output(region(0), module1.sum);
    sc_in<int> octal_input[1](1, module1.addends[1]);

}
``` 

In the SystemC code above, the module's input and output signals are specified through octal inputs and outputs, which are connected. The addition procedure is executed by a thread and processes the two numbers provided by octal_input.read().The summation is displayed through hexadecimal_Output.write(). The main code has been greatly simplified overall.
