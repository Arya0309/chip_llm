  This is a C++/C program that finds the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using a while loop. The program reads in two integers through input, a and b, and stores them in variables max_num and a. The while loop then iterates through each iteration, starting at 21 and incrementing by 1 each time. The program checks whether the current maximum number is divisible by a and b, and if so, it outputs the LCM and ends the loop. If the current maximum number is not divisible by a and b, it increments by 1 and continues looping until it reaches the LCM.

Inputs: a, b
Outputs: lcm_result

```scss
# C++ program to find the LCM of two
# numbers using the while loop
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int a = 15, b = 20, max_num = 21, flag = 1;

	// Use ternary operator to get the
	// large number
	max_num = (a > b) ? a : b;

	while (flag) {
		// if statement checks max_num is completely
		// divisible by n1 and n2.
		if (max_num % a == 0 && max_num % b == 0) {
			cout << "LCM of " << a << " and " << b << " is "
				<< max_num;
			break;
		}

		// update by 1 on each iteration
		++max_num;
	}
	return 0;
}

```

// SystemC code that replicates the same behavior


```scss
// Calc the LCM of two integers
module CalcLCM
# (
    input  int a,  // First number
    input  int b,  // Second number
    output int x   // LCM result
);
// Instantiate the inputs and outputs
sc_in a, b;
sc_out x

// Models for each iteration

// Part 1: perform a basic division
assign x = max_num;
assign max_num = a * b;

// Part 2: Check if the result is divisible by a and b
assign flag = (max_num % a == 0 && max_num % b == 0);

// Part 3: Assign the result of the LCM output
if (flag == 1) then 
	 output x = max_num;
else
	update max_num;

end if;
propagate(false);

endmodule

The `sc_in` and `sc_out` port identifiers used in the SystemC code must be based on the provided sc_in signals a and b, which are exposed to the fully compiled HDL simulation environment.
