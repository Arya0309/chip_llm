  This C++/C code defines a function, `octalToDecimal`, that takes an octal input and returns its decimal representation. The code uses a while loop to break down the octal number into its individual digits, each represented by a single digit in the range of 0 to 7. The `base` variable is initialized to 1 and increases by 8 at each iteration to represent the 8-power, which is taken as the base for conversion from octal to decimal. The last digit is extracted by taking the remainder of the division by 10 and then dividing the result by 10. The extracted digit is multiplied by the current value of `base` before being added to the decimation value. After the loop finished, the sum is returned.

`main` serves as the driver code and calls the `octalToDecimal` function with a given octal number as input. The output of the function is printed to the console.

The signals `octal_input`, `decimal_output` can be used as inputs and outputs in a high-level synthesis flow.
