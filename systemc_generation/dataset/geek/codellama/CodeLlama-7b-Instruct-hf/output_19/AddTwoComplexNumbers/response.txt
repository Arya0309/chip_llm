  **Inputs and Outputs:**

The C++/C code provides two inputs, `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, and `imag2`, and two outputs, `real_sum` and `imag_sum`. These inputs and outputs are shown in the diagram below.

**Summary:**

The code first defines a C++ class `Complex` with two variables, `real` and `imaginary`, which are both ints. This class has a constructor that takes two ints as input and sets `real` and `imaginary` to those values. It also has a method `addComp` that takes two objects of type `Complex` as input and returns the sum of the two complex numbers.

In the main function, two objects of type `Complex` are created and `real1` and `imag1` are set to 3 and 2 respectively. `real2` and `imag2` are set to 9 and 5 respectively. The function then calls the `addComp` method on these objects, summing the `real` and `imaginary` components in the process. The result is stored in `C3`. Finally, it prints the result using `cout`.

**SystemC Implementation:**

The SystemC implementation of the code can be written as follows.
```scss
import <systemc.h>;

using namespace std;

// User Defined Complex class
class Complex : public sc_module {
  Complex(int tempReal = 0, int tempImaginary = 0) {
    // Constructor to accept real and imaginary part
    real = tempReal;
    imaginary = tempImaginary;
  }

  // Method to add the two complex numbers
  Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2) {
    // Creating temporary variables
    Complex temp;

    // Adding real part of complex numbers
    temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;

    // Adding imaginary part of complex numbers
    temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);

    // Returning the sum
    return temp;
  }
};

// Driver code
int sc_main() {
  // First Complex number
  Complex real1(3, 2);

  // Printing first complex number
  cout << "Complex number 1 : " << real1.real << " + i" << real1.imaginary << endl;

  // Second Complex number
  Complex real2(9, 5);

  // Printing second complex number
  cout << "Complex number 2 : " << real2.real << " + i" << real2.imaginary << endl;

  // For Storing the sum
  Complex C3 = real1.addComp(real2);

  // Printing the sum
  cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary << endl;

  // Waiting for the simulation to finish
  wait(10, SC_NS);
  return 0;
}
```
In the SystemC implementation, the class `Complex` is now derived from `sc_module`, since it is now a module. The `addComp` method has been translated directly to SystemC and takes two objects of type `Complex` as input. The port itself has been declared with type `<int>` to ensure compatibility.

The simulation can be run using the provided testbench, which can generate data for both real and imaginary components of the two complex numbers and pass it as input to the module. The output of the simulation is the sum of the two complex numbers, which is then printed.

**Conclusion:**

The C++/C code provided adds two complex numbers by summing their real and imaginary components. This has been implemented in SystemC, which is a high-level hardware description language created by IEEE. SystemC simplifies the process of rendering code synthesizable by exposing a system-C and hardware description, making system-C and hardware description language into platforms for design synthesis.
