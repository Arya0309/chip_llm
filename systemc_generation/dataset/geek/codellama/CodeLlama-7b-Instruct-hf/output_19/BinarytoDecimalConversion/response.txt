  **Input(s):** The input to this code is a binary number represented as an integer (i.e., a non-negative integer) called 'n'.

**Output(s):** The output of this code is the decimal equivalent of the input binary number.

**Code Summary:**
The provided C++/C code defines a function called "binaryToDecimal" which takes an integer 'n' as input and returns its decimal equivalent. Inside the function, an int variable is declared to hold the result of the conversion.

The function uses a loop to repeatedly divide the input number by 2 until the result is zero. For each iteration, the last digit of the input number is obtained by taking the modulus (%) operator with 10. This digit is then multiplied by a power of 2 (initialized to 1) to convert it to a decimal number. The product is then added to the running total, which is initially zero. The loop continues until the input number is zero. The final value of the running total is returned as the function's output.

**SystemC Equivalent:**
To correspond to the C++/C code, we can write the following SystemC code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Function to convert binary to decimal
int binaryToDecimal(int n)
{
    int dec_value = 0;
    int base = 1;
    while (n > 0) {
        int last_digit = n % 10;
        n /= 10;
        base *= 2;
        dec_value += last_digit * base;
    }
    return dec_value;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    sc_in<int> binary_in;  // Input port for the binary number
    sc_out<int> decimal_out;  // Output port for the decimal number
    int num = binaryToDecimal(binary_in.read());  // Call the C++/C function to convert the binary number
    decimal_out.write(num);  // Write the decimal equivalent to the output port
    return 0;
}
```
Note that we have added a sc_in and sc_out port to the SystemC module to correspond to the C++/C program's inputs and outputs. We have also written a function that calculates the decimal equivalent of an input binary number using the same algorithm as the C++/C code. Finally, we have added a driver module that reads an input binary number from the input port, calls the C++/C function to convert it to decimal, and writes the result to the output port.
