  This is a C++ program that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not, using the standard definition for leap years as the ones that are divisible by 4. The function `checkYear` takes an `int` argument and returns a `bool` indicating whether the year is a leap year. The driver code demonstrates that this function by checking whether the year 2000 is a leap year, which returns `true`. 

As a natural language explanation, it appears that the program considers years divisible by 400 to be leap years, years not divisible by 100 to be leap years, and other years not divisible by 4 to be leap years. The four `if` statements sequentially test whether the input is divisible by these three different numbers; if it is, it returns true. If not, it returns `false`. Another scenario is one has to input a year into the function, and that is it.

To turn this code into SystemC, we need to define a module that takes in two integer inputs named `year_in` and outputs a `leapYear_out`. For this, we can use the following SystemC code snippet:

```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(IsLeapYear) {

    // Ports
    sc_out<bool> leapYear_out;
    sc_in<int> year_in;

    // Method to perform leap year check
    void checkLeapYear() {
		int year = year_in.read();

        if (year % 400 == 0) {
            leapYear_out.write(true);
        } else if (year % 100 == 0) {
            leapYear_out.write(false);
        } else if (year % 4 == 0) {
            leapyear_out.write(true);
        } else {
            leapyear_out.write(false);
        }
    }

};
```
We can include this `IsLeapYear module module' in another program file to benefit from our `checkLeapYear` function.

sc_in<bool> year_in;
IsLeapYear IL;
IL.checkLeapYear();
bool result = year_in.read();

The above code connects the `year_in` signal to the `year_in` input in the module. Also, it connects the `leapYear_out` signal to the `result` variable, but it doesn't perform any evaluation. It's the callers job to decide when to call the `checkLeapYear` method to get the calculated result.
