  This program calculates the sum of two diagonals in a square matrix.

The program takes an array of squares, n, as input. It reads through the array row by row and column by column, using the two if statements to access the squares on the first diagonal and the second diagonal of the square.

The lines that follow assign the sum of the first diagonal to the principal variable and the sum of the second diagonal to the secondary variable, which are both declared earlier in the code as type \int.

The code then executes sequentially by outputting the sums to the printer


The code needs to be integrated into a testbench.
The system will accept a square matrix and two unsigned integers as input.
The output will consist of the diagonal sum, as well as the two diagonal sums, which will be sequential.
