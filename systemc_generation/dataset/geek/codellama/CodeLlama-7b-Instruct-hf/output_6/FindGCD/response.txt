  This is a C++/C code that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two given integers. The code finds the minimum of `a` and `b`, and then checks whether it is a divisor of both numbers. If it is, then the GCD is found and the program returns. Otherwise, it decrements the value of `res` and repeats the process.

The inputs to this code are `a` and `b`, and the output is the GCD of these two numbers.

The equivalent SystemC code would be like:

```
#include<systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(gcd)
{
  sc_in<int> a;
  sc_in<int> b;
  sc_out<int> gcd_result;
  
  //constructor
  SC_CTOR(gcd)
  {
    SC_THREAD(gcd_thread);
    sensitive<<a<<b;
  }
  
  void gcd_thread(){
  //calculating minimum of a and b
  int res = min(a.read(),b.read());
  while(res + 1){
     //check if res |a and res & b
    if(a.read()%res==0 && b.read()%res==0)
      break;
      res--;
    }
    gcd_result.write(res);
  }

  };

  ```
