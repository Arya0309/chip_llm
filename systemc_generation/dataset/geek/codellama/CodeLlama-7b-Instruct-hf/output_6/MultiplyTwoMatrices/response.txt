  The provided C++/C code defines a function `mulMat()` that takes two matrices as input and produces their product as output. The function uses nested loops to perform the multiplication and displays the result on the console. The input matrices are passed as 2D arrays, and the output is also a 2D array.

Line-by-line explanation:

1. The `mulMat()` function is defined as a function that takes two 2D arrays `mat1` and `mat2` as input and returns nothing, i.e., `void mulMat()`.
2. The function creates an 2D array variable called `rslt` of size `R1` x `C2`.
3. The function initializes the `cout` statement to print the multiplication of the two matrices.
4. The function then enters a nested loop that traverses the two input matrices, `mat1` and `mat2`, one element at a time.
5. Inside the nested loop, the code calculates the product of the two elements by multiplying the corresponding elements of `mat1` and `mat2`. The product is stored in `rslt`.
6. The code also outputs the result to `cout`.
7. The function then exits the nested loop and displays the final result.

SystemC code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that performs matrix multiplication
SC_MODULE(MulMat) {
    // Input ports for the two matrices
    sc_in<int> mat1[2][2];   // Matrix 1
    sc_in<int> mat2[2][3];   // Matrix 2
    sc_out<int> rslt[4][4];  // Matrix Product

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MulMat) {
        // Process to perform multiplication
        SC_METHOD(mul_mat);
        sensitive << mat1 << mat2;
    }

    // Method to perform multiplication
    void mul_mat() {
        int tmp[2][3];

        for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                tmp[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k < R2; k++) {
                    tmp[i][j] += mat1[i][k] * mat2[k][j];
                }
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                rslt[i][j] = tmp[i][j];
            }
        }
    }
};
```
The SystemC code defines an equivalent module `MulMat` that performs the matrix multiplication. The module has three input ports: `mat1`, `mat2`, and `rslt`. The `mul_mat()` method performs the actual multiplication by traversing the input matrices and calculating the product of the corresponding elements. The final result is stored in `rslt`.

The code defines four `int` arrays: `tmp` (for temporary results), `mat1`, `mat2`, and `rslt`. The `tmp` array is used to store the product of the two matrices, `mat1` and `mat2`. The `mat1`, `mat2`, and `rslt` arrays are used to store the input and output matrices, respectively.

The `MulMat` module can be integrated with the signal `A[SIZE_A]`, `B[SIZE_B]`, and `C[SIZE_RESULT]` seamlessly, allowing the module to be used in a high-level synthesis flow.
