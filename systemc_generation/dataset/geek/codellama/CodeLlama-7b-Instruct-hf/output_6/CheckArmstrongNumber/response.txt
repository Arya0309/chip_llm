  Inputs:

* n (an integer)

Outputs:

* is_armstrong (a boolean)

Summary:
This C++/C code calculates an integer n if it is an Armstrong number, where the sum of its cubes is equal to the given number. It does this using a while loop that repeatedly divides n by ten and subtracts the remainder (the individual digit) from it, calculating the sum of the individual digits using the formula (rem * rem * rem). Outside of the loop, it compares whether the original input's value was the same as the calculated sum, indicating whether it matches the Armstrong number condition. Finally, it reports a message indicating whether it is an Armstrong number.

**Explanation:**

Line-by-line Analysis and Conversion to SystemC.

The program receives an integer `n` from the user.
Line 7 initiates a variable (`p`) to be used as an accumulator and the program's output. It copies the initial value of `n` to `temp`, an integer variable to which it will compare in a line later.
Line 9 enters a while loop with `n`and uses a modulo operation to determine its final digit (`rem`) and simultaneously divides `n`by ten.  
Line 10 uses the repeatedly formed `rem * rem * rem` formula to update `p`, summing the individual digits. Thereafter, because `n`is now no longer a whole number, it is divided by ten repeatedly and its value is compared to `p`and determined to be either an Armstrong number or not.
Line 18 reports a message to the user when a match is found between `n`and `p`.

The equivalent SystemC code would look like this:

```
#include <systemc.h>
#include <math.h>

SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> n;  
    sc_out<bool> is_armstrong; 
    sc_signal<int> temp;
    sc_signal<int> num_in;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        SC_METHOD(armstrong);
        sensitive << n;   
    }

    void armstrong() {
        int p = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p += (rem * pow(rem, 3));
            n /= 10;
        }
        cout << ((temp == p) ? "Yes. It is an Armstrong number" : "No. It is not an Armstrong number"));
    }
};
