  To generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the original C++/C code, we will follow the tasks provided as instruction:

1. Read and thoroughly analyze the provided C++/C code.
2. Identify the input(s) and output(s) of the code.

From the code, we can observe that:

1. The input for the code is a matrix `mat` of size `R x C`, where `R` and `C` are the number of rows and columns, respectively.
2. The output of the code is the rotated matrix `mat` of size `R x C`.

Based on these inputs and outputs, we can summarize the functionality of the code as follows:

1. The code defines a function `rotatematrix` that takes in three parameters: `m`, which is the number of rows, `n`, which is the number of columns, and `mat`, which is the input matrix.
2. The function creates two iterators `row` and `col` to loop over the input matrix.
3. The function uses nested `for` loops to rotate the matrix:
   * First, it moves elements of the first row from the remaining rows to the end of the row.
   * Next, it moves elements of the last column from the remaining columns to the end of the column.
   * Then, it moves elements of the last row from the remaining rows to the end of the row.
   * Finally, it moves elements of the first column from the remaining rows to the end of the column.
   * In each of these steps, the function updates the iterators `row` and `col` accordingly.
4. Finally, the function prints the rotated matrix to the console.

Now, we can generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that reflects the same behavior as the C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

module MatrixRotator(
    sc_in<int> in[R][C],
    sc_out<int> out[R][C]);

    // Function to rotate a matrix
    void rotate_matrix() {
        // Create two iterators for the input matrix
        int row = 0;
        int col = 0;

        // Loop over the input matrix
        while (row < R && col < C) {
            // Move elements of the first row from the remaining rows
            for (int i = col; i < C; i++) {
                out[row][i] = in[row + 1][i];
            }
            row++;

            // Move elements of the last column from the remaining columns
            for (int i = row; i < R; i++) {
                out[i][C - 1] = in[i][C - 2];
            }
            C--;

            // Move elements of the last row from the remaining rows
            for (int i = C-1; i >= col; i--) {
                out[R-1][i] = in[R-2][i];
            }
            R--;

            // Move elements of the first column from the remaining rows
            for (int i = R-1; i >= row; i--) {
                out[i][col] = in[i][col-1];
            }
            col++;
        }
    }

    // Driver code
int main() {
    // Test Case 1
    int a[R][C] = {{1, 2, 3, 4},
                   {5, 6, 7, 8},
                   {9, 10, 11, 12},
                   {13, 14, 15, 16}};

    // Declare the output matrix
    int out[R][C];

    // Call the rotate_matrix function
    rotate_matrix(a, out);

    // Print the rotated matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < R; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < C; j++) {
            cout << out[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module `MatrixRotator` that takes in two arrays `in` and `out`, each of size `R x C`. The `in` array is the input matrix, while the `out` array is the output matrix after rotation.

The `rotate_matrix` function defined in the module loops over the input matrix `a` and performs the rotation operations to produce the rotated matrix `out`. The function uses two iterators `row` and `col` to loop over the input matrix, and two nested `for` loops to move elements of the first row, last column, last row, and first column to the end of the corresponding dimension.

Finally, the function prints the rotated matrix to the console.

The `main` function in the code produces a test case of a 4 x 4 matrix, calls the `rotate_matrix` function with the test case, and prints the rotated matrix to the console.
