  This program calculates the sum of all of the even-indexed Fibonacci numbers until the 8th number is reached. Since there is no n input signal, the C++/C code does not generate any signals. 

The C++/C code has two functions. The first function with the name calculateEvenSum determines the sum of all the even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to an input number. However, the code ends without producing any results. The second function, however, is the driver code. This code calls the calculateEvenSum function and gives the driver code the input value of 8 for n. The code determines the even-indexed Fibonacci numbers up to 8 values and displays the result in the console. 

Here's a resulting System C snippet to capture the exactly same behavior as the C code: 

<!-- language: lang-c -->

```
#include <systemc.h>

// Function to calculate the sum
// of even-indexed Fibonacci 
// numbers
void calculateEvenSum (int n)
{
    if (n <= 0)
        return;

    int fibo[2 * n + 1];
    fibo[0] = 0, fibo[1] = 1;

    // Initialize sum
    int sum = 0;

    // Add remaining terms
    for (int i = 2; i <= 2 * n; i++)
    {
        fibo[i] = fibo[i - 1] + fibo[i - 2];

        // For even indices
        if (i % 2 == 0)
            sum += fibo[i];
    }

    // Return the alternating sum
    return sum;
}

// Module to calculate the sum
// of even-indexed Fibonacci 
// numbers
SC_MODULE(CalculateEvenSum) {
    sc_in<int> n; // Input port for the first number
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CalculateEvenSum) {
        // Process to calculate the sum
        SC_METHOD(calc)
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to calculate the sum
    void calc () 
    {
        sc_in<int> n; // Read input from n port
        sum.write (calculateEvenSum(n.read())); // Output calculated sum
    }
};
```

At first, the `CalculateEvenSum` module has an `sc_in<int>` input port named `n` and an `sc_out<int>` output port named `sum`. These signals are equivalent to the input and output of the C++ code. 

Then, the `CalculateEvenSum` function uses `SC_METHOD` to define a function named `calc` that performs the calculation. The `calc` function performs the operation using the `calculateEvenSum` function and outputs the result to the `sum` port. Note that the input value `n` is read from the `n` input port, which is equivalent to the C++ input signal. 

In summary, the resulting SystemC code can gracefully capture the same behavior as the C++/C code. You can modify the code to work with an input signal by connecting it to one of the input ports of the module.
