  This code in C++ adds two integers and prints the result on the screen. The equivalent SystemC code that faithfully captures its logic is shown below:

```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to add the two numbers
    void add() {
        sum.write(a.read() + b.read());
    }
};
```

Instead of a function, this SystemC code makes use of a method to add the two numbers. Both inputs to the method ("a" and "b") are waited by reading their corresponding input ports ("read()") and then added together to produce the "sum" output port's value.

Note that the input and output bindings specified in the C++ code are faithfully implemented in the SystemC code. The "dec_in" signal is mapped to the "a" input port, and the "binary_out" signal is mapped to the "sum" output port.
