  This is a C++/C code snippet that computes the determinant of a matrix using LU factorization.

The code takes in a square matrix of size n, where 1 <= n <= 105, and returns its determinant. The determinant is defined as the product of the elements on the diagonal of the matrix's LU factorization.

Here's a line-by-line breakdown of the code:

1. The code first declares a constant named MAXN and a 2D array named a, which is an n x n matrix with elements of type double.
2. The determinant function starts with a loop that iterates over all rows of the matrix from the top to the bottom.
3. The inner loop of the outer loop calculates the pivot element of the current row and collapsing the current row to automatically generate the LU factorization.
4. A swap operation is performed if the pivot element is found to be non-zero.
5. The value of the determinant is calculated as the product of all non-zero diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix.
6. The code returns the value of the determinant.

The main function initializes a 2D array named matrix with elements of type double and size n by n.
It then calls the determinant function, passing in the size of the matrix as an argument.
The determinant function is called, passing in the matrix as an argument.
The determinant value is then output to the console.
The main function then ends.

How can you do it?

Here's a SystemC code snippet that reflects the behavior of the above C++/C code:

The Determinant module has two input ports and one output port.
The input ports take in the matrix and a boolean flag indicating whether the matrix is non-singular.
The output port sends the determinant of the matrix.
The Determinant module computes the determinant of the matrix using LU factorization.
The LU factorization is obtained by iteratively eliminating rows and columns of the matrix.
The determinant is calculated by taking the product of the non-zero diagonal elements of the resulting upper triangular matrix.
The method is recursively called for each row in the matrix until the matrix is of size 1.
After the determinant is computed, the method outputs the determinant.
The main function initializes a 2D array named matrix with elements of type double.
It then calls the Determinant module, passing in the matrix as an argument.
