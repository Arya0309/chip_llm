  The given C++ code computes the compound interest for a principal amount, interest rate, and time period. It does this by calculating the future value of the principal using the formula:

A = principal * ((pow(1 + rate/100, time))

Where A is the future value of the principal, principal is the initial principal amount, rate is the interest rate in decimal format, and time is the time period in years.

The code does not have any user inputs, but it does define three variables: principal, rate, and time, which are used in the formula to compute the compound interest. The output of the code is the computed compound interest value (CI).

To translate this C++ code to SystemC, we can model the module as follows:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that computes compound interest
SC_MODULE(CompoundInterest) {
    sc_in<double> principal;
    sc_in<double> rate;
    sc_in<double> time;
    sc_out<double> ci;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterest) {
        // Process to compute compound interest
        SC_METHOD(compute_compound_interest);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;

        // Assign the output port
        ci = A - principal;
    }

    // Method to compute compound interest
    void compute_compound_interest() {
        double A = principal * ((pow((1 + rate/100), time)));

        ci.write(A - principal);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define the inputs and outputs of the module, and the compute_compound_interest method that performs the computation. The `sensitive` keyword is used to specify that the method is sensitive to changes in the inputs, and the `write` method is used to assign the output once the computation is complete.

Note that the assignments to the input and output variables are not necessary in SystemC, since the module already has input and output ports. We can simply use `ci = A - principal` instead of `ci.write(A - principal)`.

Also, we can use the `pow` function from the `cmath` library in SystemC, by including the `<cmath>` header and using `std::pow` instead of `pow`. This will ensure that the computation is done in a more standard C++ way.
