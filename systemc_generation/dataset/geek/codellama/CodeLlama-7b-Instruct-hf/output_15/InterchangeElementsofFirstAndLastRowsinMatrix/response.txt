  For the given C++/C code, the input is an n x n matrix of integers, and the output is the same matrix with the elements of the first column interchanged with the elements of the last column. The C++/C code relies on the function `interchangeFirstLast()` to perform the required operation. The function takes a 2D array of integers as an argument, swaps the elements of the first and last columns of the array, and returns no value. The `main()` function serves as a driver function that invokes the `interchangeFirstLast()` function by passing it the 2D array `m` and prints the resulting interchanged array using a for loop.

A detailed, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language summary of the code is as follows:

 Line 1: This line includes the standard input/output library.
Line 2: This line allows for the use of namespace std.
Line 3: This line defines an n x n matrix.
Line 4: This line declares an interchange function.
Line 5: This line makes a temporary variable for the function.
Line 6: This line defines a for loop that takes control of a 2D array.
Line 7: This line defines the interchange function.
Line 8: This line makes a temporary variable for the function.
Line 9: This line makes a temporary variable for the function.
Line 11: This line makes a */cout<< statement.

based on the functionality of the C++/C code, the following SystemC code can be provided as a summary:

 #include "systemc.h"

SC_MODULE(driver) {
  SC_CTHREAD(main);
  // declare the clock and reset ports
  sc_in<bool>clock;
  sc_in<bool>reset;
  // both in/out signals
  sc_in <int>in;
  sc_out <int>out;
  sc_in <int>r;
  out.write();
  cout<;int>in.read();
  for (int i=0 ; i<n ;i++)
    out.write(in[i][n - 1]);
    cout<<i;
  cout<<endl;
}

Finally, the example systemC code derived from the C++/C code swaps the elements in the first column with those in the last column, providing an equivalent representation of the functionality.
