  This code is written in C++ and is intended to convert a binary number from a stream to a decimal number.

The variables and functions used are as follows:
* n is an integer input variable that carries the binary number.
* num is a copy of n that is used for local purposes.
* to convert the input binary number to decimal, a modified base-2 exponential system is developed, where each digit is multiplied by its corresponding power of 2.
* the variable base is used to keep track of this system, starting at 1 and raising 2 each time a digit is taken down.
* the while loop starts with num and stops when its value is too low to justify its use. In each iteration, last_digit gives the name of the current digit and powers of 2 (starting at 1) are utilized to translate it into a proper decimal.
* The function converts the binary number to a decimal number and returns the answer.


* a driver code is permitted to call the binaryToDecimal function and display the conversion response, which is tied to an STD output stream.
* The driver function is randomized to set the variable num, ask for the conversion via the binaryToDecimal function, and output the result using the STD output stream.
* SystemC code may be produced to accomplish the same objective.


SystemC code to convert binary to decimal using the provided signals:

```
#include <systemc.h>

/* Observe that the input ports are binary_in, and the output port is decimal_out.
 * These ports will be utilized in the SystemC conversion port. They are equated to those of 
 * the C++/C driver code shown earlier. */


// Module responsible for converting a binary input from a stream to a decimal output in SystemC.
SC_MODULE(BinaryToDecimal_sc) {
  // Declare the binary input and output ports.
  sc_in<int> binary_in;  // Input port for the binary input value.
  sc_out<int> decimal_out; // Output port for the decimal output value.

  // Function that converts a binary input stream to a decimal output in SystemC.
  void convert() {
    int dec_value = 0;
    decimal_out.write(binary_in.read());
  }
};

/* SystemC code that combines the BinaryToDecimal_sc module, the binary_in signal from the driver code, 
 *and the decimal_out signal to present the output value. */

SC_MODULE(Adder) {
  sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the binary input.
  sc_out<int> decimal_out;  // Output port for the converted binary input's decimal value.

  // Incorporate the BinaryToDecimal_sc module into the system. Introduce signals and tasks.
  BinaryToDecimal_sc BinaryToDecimal;
  sc_out<int> binary_in(BinaryToDecimal.binary_in);

  // Declare the system task of adding the two inputs.
  void add();

  // Declare the constructor.
  SC_CTOR(Adder) {
    SC_THREAD(add);
  }
};

// Driver code to set up the adder system and run it.
int sc_main(int argc, char** argv)
{

  // Instantiate the adder system
  Adder A;

  int ONE_BIT = 1;  // Define ONE_BIT to equal the value 1, which is 2 raised to 0

  int num = 10101001; // The number representation input is 10101001 in binary, which is 105 in decimal.
  int power = Num;

  // Convert the input binary number to a decimal number.
  while (power != 0)
  {
    int last_digit = num % 10; // Yield the 1-digit binary number at the end of the decimal number.
    num = num / 10; // Rearrange the number to leave out the last digit.
    // The last digit is multiplied by the appropriate power of 2 in Ramstage before being added to the sum
    dec_value += last_digit * base ** 2;
    base = 2;
  }
  cout << " The number input as binary is: " << decimalToDecimal(num) << endl;

  return 0;
}
