  **Summary of the Code**
The input and output of the given C++ / C code are A [] [N] and B [] [N]. The code simply takes a square integer grid A, calculates its transpose by swapping the rows and columns of A, and saves the resulting grid in B. The resulting matrix B has every number in the normal matrix transposed.

**Explain the C++/C code line-by-line and block-by-block**

* The C++/C code uses the N library to include the standard libraries.
* The macro N is declared.
* The function transpose is defined as part of the program itself.
* The input parameters to the transpose function are A[] [N] and B[] [N].
* The nest functions use two loops to test each entry in the matrix and swap.
* The code writes the result into B[I][J] = A[J][I].
* The driver for the program, main(), calls the transpose function and outputs a matrix B[] [N] that reflects the matrix A[] [N] with its row and columns transposed by applying the function transpose().

**Generate SystemC code**
The SystemC code to generate the result matrix B[] [N] from the input matrix A[] [N] is shown below:
 
#include <systemc.h>
 
// Transpose function in SystemC to perform the task
SC_MODULE(transpose)
{
    sc_in<int> A [N] [N]; // input array
    sc_out<int> B [N] [N]; // output array
 
    SC_METHOD (transpose);
    sensitive << A;
 
    void transpose() {
        int i, j;
        for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
            for (j = 0; j < N; j++)
                B[i][j] = A[j][i];
    }
};
 
// Driver code block
int main()
{
    int A[N] [N] = {{1, 1, 1, 1},
                     {2, 2, 2, 2},
                     {3, 3, 3, 3},
                     {4, 4, 4, 4}};
 
    int B[N] [N];
 
    // Instantiate the transpose module object
    sc_module Transpose;
 
    // Connect the input and output arrays of the transpose module object with A and B arrays
    connect(Transpose.A, A);
    connect(Transpose.B, B);
 
    // Start simulation
    sc_start();
 
    cout <<"Result matrix is \n";
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < N; j++)
            cout << " " << B[i][j];
            cout << "\n";
        }
    return 0;
}

The driver code starts the simulation and writes the result matrix B[] [N] to the output B. Each entry of B[] [N] is obtained by evaluating the transpose function that uses a nested loop to calculate the transpose of the input matrix A[] [N]. This ensures that the result matrix B has each number in the normal matrix A translated and its row and columns inverted.  This program demonstrates how SystemC can be used to create functionally equivalent C++/C code that can be used to perform the same task and provide seamless integration with existing tools.
