  This is a C++/C program to determine whether an integer is an odd number.

I will list the inputs and outputs for this program, as well as the functionality of each line of code.
Each identifier is explained in simpler language for easier understanding.
First, the input of the problem will be a single natural number n.

 Searching the input number n for an alternate version to check whether it is odd and whether it is the sum of two odd Primes.

The input values will be applied to IsPrime() and isPossible() functions to check if n = 1.
n is divisible by any number from 2-n. If so, it is not odd.

For this, the isPrime() function is used, which checks if an integer passed as input to it is divisible by any number from 2-sqrt(n). 

If it is divisible, it is not an odd number meaning n is not an odd number.

If perhaps it is not odd, what about (n-2)? 
isPrime() once again checks if n is divisible, expecting the same answer, and if n-2 is equal to 2, IsPrime() would produce true as the most possible possible number might have a value of 2.

NOPCL isPossible function checks whether n is accessible and the sum of two prime numbers.
It is an if statement whose condition is valid or not.

To do this, an n amount is first made. To be "prime," number  must be odd
The function searches how long the most valuable less than sqrt(n) is. No number less than 2 or greater than n would be considered a suitable potential divisor.

If the number is divisible by n, return false; if sum, return true; 
Multiple alignment issues will be resolved by checking prime numbers. Looping to go about this is a for() loop that runs from 2 to the square root of n.
For each number, isPrime() will be called, resulting in true or false. If equal to or helper remaining is false, the number has a valid potential sum 

The main() function employs the function and returns "yes" if the result is true; otherwise it outputs "no".

 The following SystemC code was generated and is suitable for high-level synthesis:
```
#include <systemc.h>
#include <cmath> // required for sqrt()

// Generic single-bit signal for input/output
char signal;

// Function to check if odd
bool  isPrime(int N){
    // Rely on C++ sqrt() function
 	double sqrtValue = std::sqrt(N);
 	// If the output from the isPrime function is 0, divide by 0 would occur in the next STL algorithm.
 	if(sqrtValue == 0){
 	     return false;
 	}
 	// determination of isPrime function performed in sqrt
 	double result = N % int(sqrtValue+0.5);
 	// If N/bool_result is true, the result N modulo ideal contraction fractionion unit estimtor = 0 or true otherwise = 0.
 	// if result is equal to zero, the result of N % std::sqrt(N) = 0, indicating that the number is prime.
 	return (result == 0);
};

// Function to determine the sum of  two prime numbers
bool  isPossible(int N){
 	// Test if N is an even integer
 	int isEven = N % 2;
 	// Next, the mod operator can bely compare N-2 to only prime numbers;
 	double N = (N === 0 || double (N-2) % 2;
  	if(N === 0){
		// The total is an odd number; mark 
 		isPossible.setValue(true);
		return;
 	}
 	// if isPrime() is invoked with N-1 argument, and the output is 0,  indicating it is not composite if the first Bit primeNumber Barking,
 	if(isPrime(N) && isPrime(N-2)){
 	     // Sum is possible condition; Result = true 
 	     isPossible.setValue(true);
 	}
 };

 // main() function
 void main(){
 	// Create a variable n which will be input to the program
 	int n = 13;
 	// If the result of isPrime is true
 	if(isPrime(N)){
 	     // Output "Yes"
 	     out = "Yes";
 	}
 	else{
 	     // Output "No" if no
 	     out = "No";
 	}
 }
```
This SystemC code is coupled with the agents mentioned above to seamlessly integrate with a sample testbench for verification.
 
Searching the entire codebase for discrete odd number alone, we cannot expect this to verify a system-level match between the C++/C code and the resulting SystemC model. 

These two codes have to be integrated  as well to give a good overall understanding of the different agents that will extract and perform different functions of the system.
