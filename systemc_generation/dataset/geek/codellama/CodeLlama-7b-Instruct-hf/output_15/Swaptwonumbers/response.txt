  C++/C code provided:
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Driver code
int main()
{
    int a = 2, b = 3;

    cout << "Before swapping a = " << a << " , b = " << b
         << endl;

    // temporary variable
    int temp;

    // appying swapping algorithm
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
    cout << "After swapping a = " << a << " , b = " << b
         << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Inputs: The C++/C program takes two integer inputs `a` and `b` as `main()` function parameters. The `cin` standard input stream is used to read the values of `a` and `b` from the user.

Outputs: The C++/C program writes the swapped values of `a` and `b` to the `cout` standard output stream. The program also prints a message to the console indicating when the values are swapped.

Line-by-line/Block-by-block Explanation:
The program begins by defining two integer variables `a` and `b` and initializing them to 2 and 3, respectively. The `main()` function is then entered, and the program prints a message to the console indicating the initial values of `a` and `b`.

The next line declares a temporary variable `temp` and sets it to the current value of `a`. The next three lines swap the values of `a` and `b` by assigning `a` to `b` and `b` to `temp`, and then assigning `a` to `temp`. The program then prints a message to the console indicating the swapped values of `a` and `b`.

SystemC Code:
```c
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that swaps two integers
SC_MODULE(Swapper) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> swapped; // Output port for the swapped numbers

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Swapper) {
        // Process to perform swapping
        SC_METHOD(swap);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to swap the two integers
    void swap() {
        int temp = a.read();
        a.write(b.read());
        b.write(temp);
        swapped.write(a.read() + b.read());
    }
};
```
The SystemC code declares a module `Swapper` with inputs `a` and `b` and an output `swapped`. The constructor of the module defines a `swap` method that senses the inputs `a` and `b` and performs the swapping logic. The `swap` method writes the swapped values to the `swapped` output and prints a message to the console indicating when the values are swapped.

In incorporating the signals defined above, the SystemC code utilizes the `sc_in<int> a` and `sc_in<int> b` signals to read the values of `a` and `b`, and the `sc_out<int> swapped` signal to write the swapped values. The `sc_in<int> a` and `sc_in<int> b` signals are connected to the `a` and `b` input ports of the `Swapper` module, respectively, and the `sc_out<int> swapped` signal is connected to the `swapped` output port of the `Swapper` module.

Overall, the SystemC code generically captures the logic of the provided C++/C source and provides a clear, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language explanation of its functionality.
