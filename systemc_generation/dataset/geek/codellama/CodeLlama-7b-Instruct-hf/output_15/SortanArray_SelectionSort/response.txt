  Task Description:

You will be given a C++/C program that has already been written. Your task is to:

1. Analyze the provided code by reading it thoroughly, identifying its input and output sources, and generating a natural language summary that says:
	* The inputs and output ports of the code.
	* Each major element lies inside the code and the associated operation (declarations, loops, conditions, transformations).
2. Finally, based on your research, generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that correctly preserves the logic.

**Provided Signals**:

* `sc_in<bool> clk`. The clock signal for the electronics system.
* `sc_in<bool> start`. The start signal tells the program to execute the sorting method.
* `sc_out<bool> done`. The done signal tells the program to stop execution.

**C++/C Code**

```
// C++ program for implementation of 
// selection sort 
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std; 

// Swap Function 
void swap(int *xp, int *yp) 
{ 
    int temp = *xp; 
   * xp = *yp; 
   * yp = temp; 
} 

void selectionSort(int arr[], int n) 
{ 
   int i, j, min_idx; 

   // One by one move boundary of 
   // unsorted subarray 
   for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) 
   { 

      // Find the minimum element in 
      // unsorted array 
      min_idx = i; 
   for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) 
      if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) 
       min_idx = i; 

      // Swap the found minimum element 
      // with the first element 
      swap(&arr[min_idx], &arr[i]); 
   } 
} 

// Function to print an array 
void printArray(int arr[], int size) 
{ 
   int i; 
   for (i=0; i < size; i++) 
      cout << arr[i] << " "; 
   cout << endl; 
} 

// Driver program to test above 
int main() 
{ 
   int arr[] = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11}; 
   int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]); 
   selectionSort(arr, n); 
   cout << "Sorted array: "; 
   printArray(arr, n); 
   return 0; 
} 
```

By performing the exercises below, you should be able to complete your homework:

Task: 1. Perform a thorough analysis of the provided C++/C code. Determine the inputs and outputs of the program, and then provide a natural language summary that says:

*The program below uses the `selectionSort` method to sort the integers in the `arr` array according to a selection sort scheme.
*The implied sorting operation is carried out on the `main` function's `for` loop that iterates from 0 to `n-1`, working with the `i`, `j`, and `min_idx` variables.

1. Identify the inputs and outputs of the code.
	*The inputs are the initial values included in the `arr` array, and a value `n` for the `selectionSort` method.
	*The outputs are the original `arr` array sorted and printed out.

1. Provide a natural language summary that says:
	* The inputs and output ports of the code are int `arr`[10] and int `n`. When this file is run, it sorts the `arr` array according to a selection sorting pattern. The resulting sorted array is then printed through the use of the `printArray` function. Because the `done` port was not defined, no useful function arises for it to do in this circumstance. The `start` port, which sends a `1` to every beat of the `clk` port, is used to begin the sorting program.
2. Identify the input and output signals in the C++/C code.
	*The inputs are the variables `arr`, `n`, and `clk`.
	*The outputs are the values included in `arr` sorted, as well as the `done` and `start` port values.

1. Generate SystemC code that reflects the same behavior. The underlying logic must be preserved.
	* SystemC code.
```
#include<systemc.h>
SC_MODULE(Sorting) {
	// Functions and Variables Declaration 
	SC_ simplified_signal<sc_in/sc_out> arr[10];
	sc_in<sc_bool> clk;
	sc_in<sc_bool> start;
	sc_out<sc_bool> done;
	// Function
	void selectionSort(int arr[], int n) {
		int i, j, min_idx;
		for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
		{
			// Find the minimum element in
			// unsorted array
			min_idx = i;
			for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++)
			if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx])
				min_idx = j;

			// Swap the found minimum element
			// with the first element
			swap(&arr[min_idx], &arr[i]);
		}
	}
};
```
