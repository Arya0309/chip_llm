  This is a C++ code that checks if a number is even or odd using the modulo operator.

The inputs of this program are:
a  number

The outputs are:
"Even" or "Odd"

Each major line or block of code is:
Declaring the number using the data type int and using namespace std; 

Inside main:
Declaring the location of the input integer variable using the integer data type

Performing a modulo operation modulo 2 to check if the result is 0, which corresponds to an even number
Basis on the result, the output is 
"Even" if the result of the modulo is zero, and "Odd" otherwise
Afterward, the address of the string "Even" or "Odd" is output
Both the string constant are declared as static string variables that are saved in the testbench

The SystemC code is:

```c
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(text_print) {
	sc_in<int> a;
	sc_out<int> b;
	const char* const a_str = "Even";
	const char* const b_str = "Odd";

	SC_METHOD(text_print);
	sensitive << a << b;
};

void text_print() {
	if (a == 0)
		b = a_str;
	else
		b = b_str;
}
```
