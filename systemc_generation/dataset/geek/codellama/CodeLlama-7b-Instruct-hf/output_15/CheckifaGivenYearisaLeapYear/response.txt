  Given the following C++/C code,

```
// C++ program to check if a given year is a leap year or not
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to check leap year
bool checkYear(int year)
{
	if (year % 400 == 0) {
		return true;
	}

	// not a leap year if divisible by 100
	// but not divisible by 400
	else if (year % 100 == 0) {
		return false;
	}

	// leap year if not divisible by 100
	// but divisible by 4
	else if (year % 4 == 0) {
		return true;
	}

	// all other years are not leap years
	else {
		return false;
	}
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int year = 2000;

	checkYear(year) ? cout << "Leap Year"
					: cout << "Not a Leap Year";

	return 0;
}
```

this logic can be used to determine if a given year is a leap year or not. The function takes in an integer, and returns a bool value, which represents whether the year is a leap year or not. The  C++/C code checks if the year is a leap year by using modular arithmetic.

The first condition is to see if the year is a leap year because it is divisible by 400 which makes it a leap year. If the statement in the second if statement is true, then it is not a leap year because it is divisible by 100 but not by 400. There are two other statements that check if the year is a leap year using modular arithmetic, which are in the last two else if conditions. The latter condition checks if the year is a leap year because it is divisible by 4. Finally, the program returns false for all other years that are not divisible by 400 and are not divisible by 100.

The output of the program is printed on the console based on the function return value. Using the systemC library, we can create a similar function to check if a given year is a leap year.

Here's an example of SystemC code that implements the same logic:

```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(IsLeapYear) {

    SC_CTOR(IsLeapYear) : SC_CTOR(int year) {
        SC_METHOD(checkLeapYears);
        sensitive<<year;
    }
  

    void checkLeapYear(); {
        if      (year%4 == 0)
            cout << "Leap year" << endl;
         els {
            cout << "not a leap year" << endl;
        }

    }
 };
int main() {
    SC_CTOR(IsLeapYear<int> mySystem("myIsLeapYear");
    mySystem.year (2000);
    mySystem.run();
}     
```

This program takes in an integer input. It is created using the SystemC library C++/C code. The input is converted to a boolean value, which is then output to the console. In the generated SystemC code, an SC_CTOR is used to pass with a constructor function that takes a single parameter. The 'sensitive<<'(i)> is used to sensitivity check the clock. The checkLeapYears method checks if the given year is a leap year by performing modular arithmetic. The method takes in a single integer parameter, and the output is printed to the console by using the cout method. The program runs with the run() method, which is the entry point for the execution of all methods in the module IsLeapYear. 

To confirm a specific year is a leap year or not, the input in the SC_CTOR should be changed.
