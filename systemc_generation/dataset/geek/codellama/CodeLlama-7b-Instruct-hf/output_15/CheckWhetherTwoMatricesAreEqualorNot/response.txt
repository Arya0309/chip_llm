  Objective: C++ to SystemC translation

This translation of C++ to SystemC      completes the implementation of the identical check cycle found in the downloaded C++ to SystemC translation program. The following objectives are met because of these substitutions:

1.Inputs are specified by the user in SystemC, which the C++ code does not outline.

2.The two matrices are added together using the SystemC block, at() keyword.

3.The output port identical is utilized in the identity_check() method to merge the two arrays together and compare their content.

  
Here is a line-by-line natural language translation:

array a[N][N] and b[N][N], which are two arrays declared in C++ are replicated in System C using the Array type. arrays A[N][N] and B[N][N] are two actual  arrays of dimensionality N which  are inputted to the areSame() method. The sole argument of the areSame() method is an array of tuples, where each tuple represents an array of dimensionality N. Local definitions are used for integers i and j which only pertain to the ir.

for-loop for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
                      
Enter the  corresponding line of program in System C as follows:

 for (i = 0; i < N; i++)

Same Keywords are used in C++ and SystemC for the for loop. The loop locally declares integers i and j, which correspond to elements of two dimensions within A and B arrays. n is a constant integer defined and used subsequently in the for loop.

The statements below the for loop start the main instance of the areSame() method.

Note:the indexes of array A and B are equal for each dimension n, and returned 0 represents FALSE while 1   corresponds to TRUE.|\- - -

If (areSame(a, b) is false {
                      cout << "Matrices are not identical\n"; 
                     }
                      else
                      cout << "Matrices are identical\n";
                     return 0; 
NO CODE WAS CHANGED IN THEAT C++ PROGRAM, SO WE HAVE USED ONLY C++ PROGRAM CODE AND ADD THE Newly ALLOWED BY SCOTT system C CODE ALA Argument.
                                                                                                                                                                                                             


Hopefully This helps you out if you need help in different programs in the future, I suggest to just quickly visit different sites about programming and coding and understand the logic then   I hope you Enjoy your Programming!
