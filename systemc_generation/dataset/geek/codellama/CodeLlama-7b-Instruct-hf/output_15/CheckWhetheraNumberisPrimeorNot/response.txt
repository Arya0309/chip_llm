  Input: A positive integer 'n' (a few examples, following the rule: n%i==0).

Output: A boolean value that indicates whether 'n' is a prime number (True/False).

Analysis:

The integer 'n' is declared as a variable in the program.
The number of divisors of 'n' is initially set to 0.

The code starts checking if 'n' is less than or equal to 1 or not by using an 'if' statement. If 'n' is not prime, it immediately outputs the message "n is not prime".
Otherwise, it enters the 'else' block.

The method 'check_prime'$() is called to check if n is prime. The check_prime$() method checks for divisors of n>=2, as n%1==0 and n%n==0 do not make sense in relation to divisibility. This check methods starts with an 'if' statement that states 'cnt' should be greater than 2, which also means 'n' is not multipurposed.
If 'n' is not prime, cout line outputs "n is not prime", in other case, 'n' is prime and cout line outputs "n is prime".

Flowchart of SystemC code:

Start check_prime$() method:

Check 'n%i ==0':
crowT(){alert('n%i====0');}
else Check 'n%(n)==0':
alert('n%n===0');
else check_prime$() Complete();

Else:
alert('n is not prime');
(from check_prime$())

SystemC code:
#include <systemc.h>

// SC_MODULE for check_prime$()
SC_MODULE(check_prime$) {
    sc_input<int> n;
    sc_output<bool> is_prime;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(check_prime$) {
        // Declare local variables for this method
        int cnt = 0;
    }

    // SystemC code of method
    void check_prime$() {
        // Check if n % i == 0
        if (n % 1 == 0 || n % n == 0) {
            crowT();
        } else if (cnt > 2) {
            alert('n is not prime');
        } else {
            alert('n is prime');
        }

        // Output prime status
        is_prime.write(cnt > 2);
    }
};

Testbench:
//<bits/stdc++.h>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    check_prime$ c;
    int n = 29;
    cout << c << "(" << n << ") is_prime: " << c.check_prime$(n) << endl;
    n = 127;
    cout << c << "(" << n << ") is_prime: " << c.check_prime$(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}

Remarks:
The code starts with a SystemC module defined for check_prime$() that has an integer 'n' as an input and a boolean value 'is_prime' as an output. This is a SystemC equivalent of the input 'n' and output 'is_prime' in the original C++/C source. The constructor of the module declares local variables for this method to use. The check_prime$() method uses SystemC input signals for 'n' and outputs the result as a SystemC output signal 'is_prime. The check_prime$() method uses cnt to count divisors of n>=2, as n%1==0 and n%n==0 do not make sense in relation to divisibility. This check methods starts with an 'if' statement that states 'cnt' should be greater than 2, which also means 'n' is not multipurposed. The method checks for exit conditions, output values, and signals, and is    systemc module defined for check_prime$.

The code ends with a testbench that uses check_prime$() to check different inputs.
