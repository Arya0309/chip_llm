  Task 1: Read and analyze the provided C++/C code.

The provided C++/C code defines a class `Complex` for adding two complex numbers. The class contains the following members:

* A constructor that initializes the `real` and `imaginary` members to the given values.
* A method `addComp()` that takes two `Complex` objects as arguments and returns the sum of the two complex numbers.
* A `main()` function that declares two `Complex` objects, `C1` and `C2`, and uses the `addComp()` method to calculate the sum of the two complex numbers.

Task 2: Identify the inputs and outputs of the code.

The inputs of the code are:

* The real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
* The two complex numbers to be added.

The outputs of the code are:

* The sum of the two complex numbers.

Task 3: Provide a detailed, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language summary that explains:

1. The inputs and outputs of the code.
2. Each major line or block of code and its functionality.
3. The logic of the code.

The inputs to the code are declared as `int` variables `real1` and `imag1`, `real2` and `imag2`. These variables are used as arguments to the `Complex` class constructor.

The output of the code is declared as `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2`, which are used as arguments to the `addComp()` method. The `addComp()` method performs the complex number addition and returns a `Complex` object representing the sum of the two complex numbers.

The `main()` function simply declares two `Complex` objects, `C1` and `C2`, and uses the `addComp()` method to calculate the sum of the two complex numbers. The result is then printed to the console.

The logic of the code is to add two complex numbers and return the sum.

Task 4: Generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.

The equivalent SystemC code would be as follows:
```c
#include <systemc.h>
#include <cmath>

// Complex numbers
class Complex {
public:
  int real, imag;
  
  // Constructor
  Complex(int r, int i) {
    real = r;
    imag = i;
  }
  
  Complex add(Complex other) {
    Complex sum;
    sum.real = real + other.real;
    sum.imag = imag + other.imag;
    return sum;
  }
};

// Module that adds two complex numbers
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdder) {
  sc_in<int> real1, real2;
  sc_in<int> imag1, imag2;
  sc_out<Complex> sum;
  
  Complex adder_1; int adder_2;
  
  SC_CTOR(ComplexAdder) {
    SC_METHOD(adder);
    sensitive << real1 << real2 << imag1 << imag2;
  }
  
  void adder() {
    sum.write(adder_1.add(adder_2));
  }
};
```
The code uses a `Complex` class to represent the complex numbers, with a constructor that initializes the `real` and `imag` members to the given values. The `add()` method is used to add two complex numbers and return the sum.

An instance of the `ComplexAdder` module is created, which takes in `real1`, `real2`, `imag1`, and `imag2` as input ports and an `sum` output port. The `adder()` method is called whenever any of these input ports changes, which performs the complex number addition using the `add()` method. The result is then stored in the `sum` output port.

The inputs `real1`, `real2`, `imag1`, and `imag2` are declared as `int` variables, and the `sum` output port is declared as a `Complex` object. The code uses the `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<Complex>` libraries to declare these ports.

The code uses the `SC_METHOD` block to define the `adder()` method, which is called whenever any of the input ports changes. The code uses the `sensitive` keyword to specify that the method should be called whenever any of the input ports changes.

The code uses the `SC_CTOR` block to define the constructor method, which initializes the `ComplexAdder` module with the input and output ports.

The code uses the `realtor` and `imaginary` variables to represent the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers, and the `adder_1` and `adder_2` variables to represent the two `Complex` objects. The `adder()` method uses the `add()` method to add the two complex numbers and return the sum.

The code uses the `sum` output port to store the result of the complex number addition. The output port is declared as a `Complex` object.

The code provides a natural language explanation of the inputs and outputs of the code, as well as the logic of the code. The code also demonstrates how to use the `sc_in` and `sc_out` libraries to declare input and output ports.
