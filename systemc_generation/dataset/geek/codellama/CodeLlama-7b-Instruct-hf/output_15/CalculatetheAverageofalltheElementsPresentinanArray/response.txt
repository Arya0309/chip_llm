  The given C++ code calculates the average of an array of integers.

The input sample array is declared externally as sc_vector< sc_in<int> > ``data_in`` and has ``n`` elements. The output average of the array is declared externally as ``sc_out<double> ``average_out```.

The ``average`` function takes an array and its size as inputs. It then computes the sum of all elements in the array with a loop. Finally, it calculates the average by dividing the sum by the size.

The driver code creates an integer array with 9 elements:

```c++
int arr [] = {10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
```

The average of this array is then calculated using the ``average`` function:

```c++
cout << average(arr, n) << endl;
```

The output of the average is stored in the ``average_out`` variable.

The integer array and average output result can be replicated in SystemC as follows:

```scss
#include <systemc.h>

//module to calculate average of integer array
sc_module(average)
{
sc_in<int> data_in; //input array of integers
sc_in<int> n; //size of input array
sc_out<int> average_out; //output average

double average(int a[], int n)
{
    //find sum of array elements
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        sum += a[i];

    return (double)sum / n;
}

//driver code
void add () {
    int arr[] = {10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    cout << average(arr, n) << endl;
}

//top level interface
sc_interface(interface)
{
sc_input in;
sc_output out;
sc_in<int> data_in;
sc_in<int> n;
sc_out<int> average_out;

void add()
}

//wireup connections
interface.in(data_in);
interface.in(n);
interface.out(average_out);

//add hdl
interface.add(average);
}

//program that instantiates the average module
int main()
{
average average;

//driver code
average.data_in(arr);
average.n(n);
average.average_out(average_out);
average.add();

    return 0;
}
```

Replace the various sc_in<bool> and sc_out<bool> variables with similar types in the SystemC code. For example, change sc_in<int> data_in to sc_vector< sc_in<int> > data_in, as that is the input data needed by the code.
