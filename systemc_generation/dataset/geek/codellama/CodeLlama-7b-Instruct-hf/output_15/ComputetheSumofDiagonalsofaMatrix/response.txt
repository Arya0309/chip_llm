  Inputs:

* A square matrix of size `n x n` with integer elements.
* The `matrix` input is a 2D array of size `n x n` that represents the input matrix.

Outputs:

* The `principal` and `secondary` outputs are integers that represent the sum of the principal and secondary diagonals of the input matrix.
* The `principal` output is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal of the input matrix.
* The `secondary` output is the sum of the elements on the secondary diagonal of the input matrix.

Analysis:

The provided C++/C code defines a function called `printDiagonalSums` that takes a `mat` array of size `n x n` and an integer `n` as input. The function calculates and prints the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals of the input matrix.

The code first declares two local variables, `principal` and `secondary`, with values set to 0.

The code then enters a nested loop that iterates through each element of the input matrix. The loop has two conditions:

1. The first condition checks if the current element is on the main diagonal (i.e., `i == j`). If so, the element is added to the `principal` sum.
2. The second condition checks if the current element is on the secondary diagonal (i.e., `(i + j) == (n - 1)`). If so, the element is added to the `secondary` sum.

After the loop finishes, the `principal` and `secondary` sums are printed to the console.

The input `matrix` is of size `n x n` and each element is an integer value. The output `principal` and `secondary` are integers that represent the sum of the principal and secondary diagonals of the input matrix.

SystemC code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates the principal and secondary diagonal sums
SC_MODULE(PrincipalSecDiagonal) {
    // Input ports
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE]; // Input matrix
    sc_in<int> n; // Size of the input matrix

    // Output ports
    sc_out<int> principal; // Sum of the principal diagonal
    sc_out<int> secondary; // Sum of the secondary diagonal

    // Method to calculate the principal and secondary diagonal sums
    void calculateDiagonals() {
        // Initialize the principal and secondary sums to 0
        int principalSum = 0;
        int secondarySum = 0;

        // Loop through the input matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // If the current element is on the main diagonal, add it to the principal sum
                if (i == j) {
                    principalSum += matrix[i][j];
                }

                // If the current element is on the secondary diagonal, add it to the secondary sum
                if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) {
                    secondarySum += matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
        }

        // Output the principal and secondary diagonal sums
        principal.write(principalSum);
        secondary.write(secondarySum);
    }
};
```
The `PrincipalSecDiagonal` module takes an `matrix` input of size `n x n` and an `n` input of type `int` as input. The module uses the `calculateDiagonals` method to calculate and output the principal and secondary diagonal sums using the logic from the original C++/C code. The `matrix` input is accessible through the `matrix` port, while the `n` input is accessible through the `n` port. The output `principal` and `secondary` are accessible through the `principal` and `secondary` output ports, respectively.
