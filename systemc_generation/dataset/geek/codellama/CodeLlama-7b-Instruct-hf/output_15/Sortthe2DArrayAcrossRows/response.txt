  C++/C Source to SystemC Sequential Model

Summary: The provided C++/C code sorts a 2D matrix row-wise. The code takes in a 2D matrix m of size r x c and outputs the sorted matrix.

1. Outputs: The sorted 2D matrix.
2. Inputs: The unsorted 2D matrix m.

Line-by-Line Analysis:

* The C++/C code uses the namespace std, which is the standard C++ namespace.
* The code includes the standard C++ header file <bits/stdc++.h>.
* The code declares a nested array m that has dimensions r x c and is of integer type.
* The code defines a function swap() to swap the values of two integers.
* The sortRowWise() function takes in a matrix m, its number of rows r, and its number of columns c. The function creates a nested for loop that iterates over the rows of the matrix.
* The loop iterates over the columns of each row using nested for loops.
* The loop iterates over the elements of each row using nested for loops, starting from the first element of each row.
* If the current element is greater than the element at its right neighbor, the elements are swapped using the swap() function.
* The matrix is printed after the sorting is done using nested for loops.
* The driver code calls the sortRowWise() function with the matrix m, its number of rows r, and its number of columns c.

SystemC Model:

* The SystemC model will use the sc_in and sc_out ports to represent the inputs and outputs of the code.
* The sc_in and sc_out ports will be connected to the driver code using the sc_in<bool> clk, sc_in<bool> start, and sc_out<bool> done signals.
* To sort the 2D matrix row-wise, the SystemC model will use a 2D array similar to the one used in the C++/C code.
* The SystemC model will use a nested for loop similar to the one used in the C++/C code to sort each row of the matrix.
* The nested for loop will use a nested if statement similar to the one used in the C++/C code to swap the values of elements in each row if needed.
* The SystemC model will print the sorted matrix using nested for loops similar to the one used in the C++/C code.

Here is a SystemC code snippet that can be used to model the behavior described above:

```c
#include <systemc.h>

// 2D matrix with dimensions r x c
int m[r][c];

// Function to sort each row of the matrix
void sortRowWise(int matrix[][c], int r, int c) {
    for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < c - j - 1; k++) {
                if (matrix[i][k] > matrix[i][k + 1]) {
                    swap(matrix[i][k], matrix[i][k + 1]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// Function to print the sorted matrix
void printMatrix(int matrix[][c], int r, int c) {
    for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
            cout << matrix[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}

// SystemC model
SC_MODULE(sort_2D_matrix) {
    // Declare input and output ports
    sc_in<int> matrix_r;
    sc_in<int> matrix_c;
    sc_in<int> matrix[r][c];
    sc_out<int> sorted_matrix[r][c];

    // Function to sort each row of the matrix
    void sort_rows() {
        sortRowWise(matrix, matrix_r, matrix_c);
    }

    // Function to print the sorted matrix
    void print_matrix() {
        printMatrix(sorted_matrix, matrix_r, matrix_c);
    }

    // Main process
    void main() {
        sort_rows();
        print_matrix();
    }
};
```

Note: The SystemC code assumes that the number of rows (r) and columns (c) of the 2D matrix are stored in the sc_in<int> matrix_r and sc_in<int> matrix_c ports, respectively. The SystemC code assumes that the unsorted 2D matrix is stored in the sc_in<int> matrix[][c] port. The SystemC code assumes that the sorted 2D matrix is stored in the sc_out<int> sorted_matrix[][c] port.
