  This C++/C code is a simple program that calculates the simple interest of a principal amount based on a time and a rate of interest. The code takes in three inputs: P (principal amount), R (rate of interest in fractional format), and T (time in years). The code then calculates the simple interest using the formula P\*T\*R/100 and prints the result to the console. Finally, the code returns 0.

The inputs and outputs of the code are as follows:

* Inputs: P (float), R (float), T (float)
* Outputs: SI (float)

The code can be naturally broken down into the following blocks and their functionalities:

* Inclusions: The code includes the standard library of C++/C, which provides the necessary functions for I/O operations and mathematical computations.
* Namespace declaration: Using the standard namespace `std` to access the relevant functions.
* Function declaration: `main()` function is the starting point of the program.
* Declarations: `P` (principal amount), `R` (rate of interest in fractional format), and `T` (time in years) are declared as global variables. `SI` (simple interest) is declared as a global variable to store the calculated value.
* Calculation: The formula for calculating simple interest is used to calculate the SI value based on the input values of P, R, and T.
* Output: The calculated value of SI is printed to the console using `std::cout`.
* Return: The program returns 0 at the end.

In SystemC, the resulting C++/C code can be refactored as follows:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// C++/C code for calculating simple interest
sc_in<float> P;
sc_in<float> R;
sc_in<float> T;
sc_out<float> SI;

SC_MODULE(SimpleInterest) {
    // Driver code
    int main() {
        // We can change values here for different inputs
        SI = (P * T * R) / 100;

        // Print the resultant value of SI
        cout << "Simple Interest = " << SI;

        return 0;
    }
}
```
This SystemC module takes in the three inputs `P`, `R`, and `T` as floating-point numbers, and outputs the calculated simple interest `SI` as a float. The `main()` function contains the same calculation as the original C++/C code, but the SystemC code uses the `sc_in` and `sc_out` ports to handle input and output, respectively.

To integrate this SystemC code with the provided testbench signals, the following modifications can be made:
```scss
// TESTBENCH SIGNALS
sc_in<float> P(2.0);
sc_in<float> R(2.0);
sc_in<float> T(2.0);
sc_out<float> SI;

SimpleInterest simpleInterest;

// TESTBENCH STIMULUS
void stimulus() {
    // Apply P, R, and T values
    P.write(3.0);
    R.write(2.0);
    T.write(1.0);

    // Set SI as output
    SI = simpleInterest.SI;
}

void watchDog() {
    // Advance simulation
    sc_start();

    // Verify SI value
    SI.write(2.0);

    // Assert results
    std::cout << "Verification result: " << (SI == 2.0 ? "PASS" : "FAIL") << std::endl;
}
```
In this SystemC testbench, the inputs `P`, `R`, and `T` are applied using the `sc_in` ports of the `SimpleInterest` module. The `SI` value is set as the output of the `SimpleInterest` module using the `simpleInterest.SI` reference. The `stimulus()` function applies a set of values to the testbench inputs, while the `watchDog()` function advances the simulation and verifies the result of the calculation.
