  C++/C Code:
```
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    int res = min(a, b); // Find Minimum of a and b

    while (res > 1) {
        if (a % res == 0 && b % res == 0) break;
        res--;
    }
    return res;
}
```

Explanation:
The code finds the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two given numbers, a and b. It does this using two steps:

1. It finds the minimum of a and b (min(a, b)) and initializes the result variable (res) to this value.
2. It starts a loop where it decreases the value of res by 1 and tests if the numbers a and b are divisible by res, using the modulo operator (%). If either a or b is not divisible by res (i.e., the modulo operator returns something other than 0), the loop terminates. If res is 1 (i.e., the minimum of a and b), the loop terminates.

Based on the explanation above, a possible SystemC implementation could look like this:
```
#include <systemc.h> // Include SystemC library

// Module to calculate GCD of two numbers
SC_MODULE(GCD) {
    sc_in<int> a, b;    // Input ports for a and b
    sc_out<int> gcd_result;   // Output port for the GCD result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(GCD) {
        SC_METHOD(find_gcd);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to find the GCD of a and b
    void find_gcd() {
        int res = min(a.read(), b.read()); // Initialize result to the minimum of a and b

        // Loop to find the GCD
        while (res > 1) {
            if (a.read() % res == 0 && b.read() % res == 0)
                break;
            res--;
        }
        gcd_result.write(res); // Write the GCD result to the output port
    }
};
```
Note that this implementation assumes that the `gcd` function is called with two integer inputs, a and b. The `find_gcd` method uses the `sc_in` and `sc_out` ports to read and write the inputs and outputs of the module, respectively.
