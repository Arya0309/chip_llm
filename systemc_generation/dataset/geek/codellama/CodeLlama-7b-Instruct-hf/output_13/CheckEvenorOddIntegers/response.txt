  C++/C Code:

This C++/C code performs an operation to determine if the number is even or odd using the modulo operator.
number_in  is the input.
result_out conveys the result.

1. #include <bits/stdc++.h>

This line of code imports all the standard library enumerations, classes, and functions explicitly defined in the standard headers of repository.

2.  using namespace std;

the Namespace std is used to access all the standard library functions, it is an extension of the standard library and all of the standard library functions and classes use the namespace std.

3. int number_in;
{{}}

int number_in is an integer input variable.

5.  cout << "Even";     << insert system call to print the statement in the output device of the host 

This line of code inserts the system call "cout" to print the statement "even" to the output device of the host.

6.  integer modulo function or the modulus operator -> If a and b are integers, a%b computes the remainder of `a/b`.

This code provides a computer result as the remainder of the division between the two integers.   If number_in divides into evenly, the number_in will be "0"; else, number_in will not turn to "0".

7. int main() {

This function is the entry to the program. It signals that this is the program that the computer will be looking at evaluating. Its purpose to being a predecessor to the code block below.

  8.  cout << "odd"; // if "number_in" is "odd"

This line of code inserts the "system" call "cout" to print the statement "odd" if the expression "number in" is not equal to "even".

11. else

This code starts an else segment, the "else" will only run when the numbers are not equivalent, otherwise the number_in will be "even".

12. }

This indicated end of the "message" part of that number_in is not" even".

13.nresult_out = (number_in%2);

This line of code stored in the result_out variable (even) if the number_in is even or by the number_in variable in addition to the result_out variable for variable result_out equals sum.

14.return 0;

This line indicates that the operation is complete. you successfully run the program without error.

In the SystemC code below, sc_in named "number_in" and and DO signals with keeps"true".
15.SC_MODULE(evenOdd) {

This code defines a module called "evenOdd " acting in an SystemC context " . The normalization upper case and letters adjacent together are important naming conventions in SystemC.

16. sc_in<int> number_in;
    sc_out< int> result_out;

a and b are the inputs  waiting for system signals.

17. evenOdd(sc_in<int> number_in = 0, sc_out< int> result_out = 0);

This function is the constructor for the SystemC module (evenOdd)

18. SC_METHOD(evenOdd);

his line of code refers to the "evenOdd" process or method. The "SC_METHOD" keyword is needed to define (process) methods in a SystemC module.
19. evenOdd (sc_in<int> number_in = 0, sc_out<int> result_out = 0);

This line of code indicates the SystemC keyword "sensitive" which will acknowledge the presence of "number_in" and "result_out" inputs.

20. void evenOdd (sc_in<int> number_in = 0, sc_out<int> result_out = 0);

this line of code is a "void" method called "even Odd " (which) describes the computable behavior for the module (sc_in). "System" contribution follows the SystemC syntax.

21.}

22. SC_CTOR (evenOdd) {

With this line of code, "CKT construct" allows SystemC to infer behavior traces and monitor edge conditions for the six system calls in the project while restoring synthesizable-compilable code.

23. result_out = (number_in%2);

This code was found in the original code snippet. The "A write operator" writes to the "result_out" signal input.


The equivalent SystemC code is shown below.

24.  #include <systemc.h>

This line of code imports all the standard library enumerations, classes, and functions explicitly defined in the standard headers of repository.

25.  sc_in<int> number_in;
    sc_out<int> result_out;

int number_in and result_out initializes a 0 on "systemc" module.

26.  evenOdd: evenOdd (sc_in<int> number_in = 0, sc_out<int> result_out = 0);

This function is the constructor for the SystemC module (evenOdd)

27.  SC_METHOD(evenOdd);

his line of code refers to the "evenOdd" process or method. The "SC_METHOD" keyword is needed to define (process) methods in a SystemC module.

28.  evenOdd (sc_in<int> number_in = 0, sc_out<int> result_out = 0);

This line of code indicates the SystemC keyword "sensitive" which will acknowledge the presence of "number_in" and "result_out" inputs.

29.  void evenOdd (sc_in<int>     Number_in = 0, sc_out<int> result_out = 0);    

This line of code is a "void" method called "even Odd " (which) describes the computable behavior for the module (sc_in). "System" contribution follows the SystemC syntax.

30. }

31. SC_CTOR (evenOdd) {

With this line of code, "CKT construct" allows SystemC to infer behavior traces and monitor edge conditions for the six system calls in the project while restoring synthesizable-compilable code.

32.  result_out = (number_in%2);

This code was found in the original code snippet. The "A write operator" writes to the "result_out" signal input.
