  This is a program that uses the low-level functions min_element and max_element from the namespace std to find a minimum (or maximum) element in an array.

The main input to the code is the array, which is passed in as a parameter to the functions min_element and max_element.  The first parameter specifies the beginning of the array to consider, while the second parameter specifies the end of that array.  That is, the elements in the range [a, a + n) (where a is the start pointer and n is the length of the array) are to be processed.

The variable n denotes the number of elements in the specified array.

The output of the program is the minimum or maximum element of the input array.

This code uses the Bitstream++, a C/C++ standard library that provides several useful functions for working with streams.

#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

// C++ program to find minimum (or maximum) element in an array.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

The program first includes std library

Then main function is called, then simply followed by the code of program to find  based on either max_element or min_element.

The getMin or getMax function takes two parameters, one is array input and another is length if array.The function returns the minimum (max) element in that range(array - subrange) and is stored in the variable min (max)and printed via cout.

The main function initializes the array and calls the getMin (getMin) function.

The program then adds the three c++ includes to support the library of functions

The variable arr is an array of integers (int) and n is the size of the array.

The program waits until the external (i.e.  written by the user) function(getMin . or getMax) returns and assigns (introduces) the pointers to scan_out (getMin) and scan_out (getMax) to the minimum and maximum elements stored in the max_val and min_val variables.

Then the program outputs the min and max_val variables to the user via the cout.

The program stores the minimum and maximum elements in the min and max parameters and stores their iterators.
