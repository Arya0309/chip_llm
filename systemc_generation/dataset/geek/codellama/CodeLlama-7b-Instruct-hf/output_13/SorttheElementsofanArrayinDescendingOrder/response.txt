  This is a C++ program to sort an array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The program takes an array of integers as input and returns the sorted array as output.

Inputs:

* An array of integers to be sorted
* The size of the array

Outputs:

* The sorted array

The program has three functions:

1. `sort()`: This function performs the actual sorting of the array. It takes the array of integers and its size as inputs and sorts the array in ascending order.
2. `swapNums()`: This function swaps two numbers in the array.
3. `main()`: This is the main function of the program. It declares an integer array `nums` and initializes it with a few elements. It then calls the `sort()` function to sort the array. Finally, it prints the sorted array.

The `sort()` function uses a bubble sort algorithm to sort the array. The algorithm iterates over the array and swaps adjacent elements if they are not in ascending order. It continues to iterate over the array until the end is reached and no swaps are needed. The loop repeats until the end is reached and no swaps are required.

The `swapNums()` function simply swaps two elements of the array.

Now, let's generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.

SystemC Code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that performs bubble sort on a list of integers
SC_MODULE(BubbleSort) {
    sc_in<bool> clk;  // Clock signal
    sc_in<bool> start;  // Start signal
    sc_out<bool> done;  // Done signal

    // Input port for the array
    sc_in<int> i_data[5];

    // Output port for the sorted array
    sc_out<int> o_sorted[5];

    // Variable to store the size of the array
    sc_int<4> size;

    // Function to sort the array
    void sort(int num[], int len) {
        bool isSwapped = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            isSwapped = false;
            for (int j = 1; j < len - i; j++) {
                if (num[j] < num[j - 1]) {
                    swapNums(num, j, (j - 1));
                    isSwapped = true;
                }
            }
            if (!isSwapped) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // Function to swap two numbers in the array
    void swapNums(int nums[], int first, int second) {
        int curr = nums[first];
        nums[first] = nums[second];
        nums[second] = curr;
    }

    // Main function
    void main() {
        // Initialize the size of the array
        size = 5;

        // Initialize the input array
        i_data[0] = 1;
        i_data[1] = 12;
        i_data[2] = 6;
        i_data[3] = 8;
        i_data[4] = 10;

        // Call the sort function
        sort(i_data, size);

        // Print the sorted array
        // Use a loop to print all the elements
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            o_sorted[i] = i_data[i];
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code snippet, we have defined a module called `BubbleSort` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sorted array as output. The module has three functions: `sort()`, `swapNums()`, and `main()`.

The `sort()` function performs the actual sorting of the array using the bubble sort algorithm. It takes the array of integers and its size as inputs and sorts the array in ascending order.

The `swapNums()` function simply swaps two elements of the array.

The `main()` function is the main function of the module. It initializes the size of the array and an input array `i_data` with some elements. It then calls the `sort()` function to sort the array, and finally, it prints the sorted array using a loop. The output of the module is the sorted array.

The `BubbleSort` module is defined with two input ports, `i_data[]` and `size`, and one output port, `o_sorted[]`. The `i_data[]` input port takes an array of integers as input, and the `size` input port takes the size of the array as input. The `o_sorted[]` output port returns the sorted array.

Note that this SystemC code snippet assumes that the clock signal `clk` is available, and it uses it to receive the clock signal in the `sort()` function. The `start` input signal is used to start the algorithm, and the `done` output signal is used to indicate that the algorithm has completed.

In summary, this SystemC code snippet captures the logic of the original C++/C source code and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow to perform bubble sort on an array of integers.
