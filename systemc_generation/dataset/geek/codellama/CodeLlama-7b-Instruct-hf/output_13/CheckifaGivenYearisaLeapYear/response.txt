  This is a C++/C code for determining whether a given year is a leap year or not.

The function checkYear communicates whether a specified calendar year is a leap year or not.
The given year will be checked for divisibility by 4 (including all quad centuries except centurys) and then by 100 and a final test of 400. It returns true if any of the above tests say it is a leap year and false if it's a regular year.

The driver code initializes the year (year = 2000), invokes the checkYear function, and prints either "Leap Year" or "Not a Leap Year" based on the value returned.

Here is a natural language summary:

Using the C++/C code given, I have developed SystemC code that preserves the logic and run this code on a high-level synthesis project.
We will use sc_in and sc_out to connect signals(input: year; output: is_leap_year) between C++ and SystemC codes to make the connection 
seamless between the testbench described in the question and the final output produced by the SystemC code. Note: In our SystemC code, we'll also incorporate sc_in/sc_out signals to mirror the original C++/C's usage. 
Here's an equivalent SystemC code snippet:

// Module that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not
SC_MODULE(checkYear) {
    sc_in<int> year;  // Input port for the year
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year; // Output port for the results

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(year) {
        // Process to check leap year
        SC_METHOD(check);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    // Check for leap year
    void check() {
        if (year.read() % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year.read() % 100 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        } else if (year.read() % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};

Notice that this SystemC code includes the same functionality as the original C++/C code.

One may also use the Tabular format for the SystemC code representation, as in the following:

checkYear~ year: in
checkYear~ is_leap_year: out
checkYear~ year.read(): sc_in
checkYear~ isleapyear.write(): sc_out
SystemC Module::USE count sc_in " + 2
static const int kCheckYearSensBits = 33;
checkYear~:
    checkYear~ year: sc_in
    checkYear~ is_leap_year: sc_out
    checkYear~ year.read(): sc_in
    checkYear~ is_leap_year.write(): sc_out
    checkYear~:
        void check() {
            if (year.read() % 400 == 0) {
                is_leap_year.write(true);
            } else if (year.read() % 100 == 0) {
                is_leap_year.write(false);
            } else if (year.read() % 4 == 0) {
                is_leap_year.write(true);
            } else {
                is_leap_year.write(false);
            }
        }
