  Based on the provided C++/C code snippet, the task required me to identify the inputs, outputs and the logic of the given program.

1. Inputs: The program expects one input matrix of size provided as constant 'MAX'.
2. Output:  Two outputs of certain data types - 1. Principal Diagonal, 2. Secondary Diagonal.

3. The main logic of the code is to loop through the two-dimensional array and perform two checkings for the row and column. The program evaluates the two cases.
   - For a given value 'i' in row for an array 'mat', the said value when checked against itself ('i == j') becomes the principal diagonal with corresponding value being added to principal.
   - For values 'i' and  'j' corresponding to column in a row, when the (i + j) equates the remainder of	the size of array 'n' by subtracting by 1 as shown, the secondary diagonal sums the given value at that index becomes secondary.

The logic displays the diagonals of the matrix passed. To generate a similar block of code in SystemC. Using the same input and output signals, I generate the following SystemC code.

```c++ socket
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to find principal and secodary clusters
SC_MODULE(PrincipalSum) {
  sc_in<int> matrix;  // Input port for the matrix
  sc_out<int> principal; // Output port for the sum of principal
  sc_output <int> secondary; // Output port for the sum of secondary
  // constructor
  SC_CTOR(PrincipalSum) : matrix(matrix),  principal(principal), secondary(secondary)
  {

      //Callback for principal closure
      SC_METHOD(find_principal_diagonal);
      sensitive << matrix; // To detect changes in in the array
      //Callback for principal closure
      SC_METHOD(find_secondary_diagonal);
      sensitive << matrix; // To detect changes in in the array

      }

  // Finds the sum of the diagonal that corresponds to the principal
  void find_principal_diagonal() {
      std::matrix(matrix.read(); pre)
      // Alternate positions within an array i.e. row and column
      for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
          for (int j = 0; j < MAX; j++) {
              // Condition for principal diagonal
              if (i == j)
                principal += mat[i][j];
         }
      }
  }

// Finds the sum of the diagonal that corresponds to the secondary
void find_secondary_diagonal() {
      std::matrix(matrix.read(); pre)
      // Alternate positions within an array i.e. row and column
      for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
          for (int j = 0; j < MAX; j++) {
              // Condition for secondary diagonal
               if (i + j == n - 1)
                secondary += mat[i][j];
             }
          }
    }

};
```
This System C code snippet captures the given C++/C code behavior and utilizes the input and output signals as declared earlier in the task.
