  Task 1: Read and Analyze the C++/C Code

The provided code is a C++/C program that interchanges the elements of the first and last columns of a 2D array. It uses the namespace std and the preprocessor directive #define n to define the array size as 4.

The main() function takes input in the array m[n][n] and calls the interchangeFirstLast() function to interchange the elements of the first and last columns of the array. After interchanging the elements, the matrix is printed.

Task 2: Identify the Inputs and Outputs
The inputs of the code are the 4x4 matrix m[n][n], which is the array of integers that the program operates on. The outputs of the program are the arrays m[n][n] with the elements of the first and last columns interchanged.

Task 3: Detailed Summary of the Code
The code begins with the #include <iostream> and #include <cstdlib> directives to include the necessary headers. It then uses the namespace std. The #define n directive defines the array size as 4.

The main() function takes input in the array m[n][n] and assigns it to a variable m. It then calls the interchangeFirstLast() function to interchange the elements of the first and last columns of the array.

The interchangeFirstLast() function iterates through the rows of the array (using a nested for loop) and swaps the elements in the first and last columns (using three temp variables t, s, and d). The function returns void, indicating that it does not have any return value.

Finally, the main() function prints the interchanged array using a nested for loop.

Task 4: Generate Equivalent SystemC Code
To convert the C++/C code to SystemC, we can use the following code snippet:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that swaps the first and last columns of a 2D array
SC_MODULE(ArrSwap) {
    sc_in<int> inport[N][N]; // Input port for the array
    sc_out<int> outport[N][N]; // Output port for the swapped array

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ArrSwap) {
        SC_THREAD(swapColumns);
        sensitive << inport;
    }

    // Method to swap the columns
    void swapColumns() {
        int i, j, t, s, d;
        for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                t = inport[i][0];
                s = inport[i][N - 1];
                d = t;
                inport[i][0] = s;
                inport[i][N - 1] = d;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we've declared an inport and outport array to enable seamless integration with our existing testbench. We've also defined the swapColumns() method that iterates through each row of the 2D array (using a nested for loop) and swaps the elements in the first and last columns (using three temp variables t, s, and d).

Once the swapColumns() method is invoked (through the SC_THREAD directive in the constructor), the method executes and performs the column interchange. The resulting swapped array is then written to the outport array.

In the SystemC code, we've used the sc_in and sc_out signals to enable seamless integration with our existing testbench. We've also made the interchangeFirstLast() function pure SystemC, by removing the std namespace and preprocessor directives.
