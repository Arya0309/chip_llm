  Tasks:

This C++/C code provides an implementation of the selection sort algorithm, which is a method for sorting a sequence of elements, typically an array. The code identifies the input(s) (an array of integers) and output(s)(the sorted array).

Input(s): The input provided to the code is an array of integers.

Output(s): After the selection sort algorithm, the sorted array is returned.

Anatomy of the code: 

1. the method int selectionSort(int arr[], int n): implementing the selection sort algorithm involves swapping the biggest (or smallest) element (if there are more than one) in an unsorted section (arr[i]). This method first sets an integer i and j for the array loop, and to the while loop function's condition. It is essentially a method that fully uses the selectionSort() function to sort the input array from increasing to descending order.

2.The while loop function compares the while loop condition's given array[n] with its offset (j)
The swapped function swaps the minimum value with the first element value in the selection Sort function. It also assures that the swapped data will be passed through the while loop function to the next selection Sort function.

3. The for loop function  is a linear sorting process that counts how many times the selection sort function is required to the next
 
4. The last line of the code is the main function(), which represents the difference between what is inside the curly braces, which sorts the selected array and returns
The add function (a-left, b-right) returns the addition of a and b, but the code is not fully clear or functional when seen here; the explanation is important for the bit twiddling section.

Summary:

The C++/C code provides an implementation of the selection sort algorithm, which takes an array of integers as an input and returns the sorted array as an output. The code utilizes the selection sort algorithm to sort the input array and output the sorted array. The input is an array of integers and the output is the sorted array. 

By doing this, the code's output can be successfully tested and validated with the help of the test bench.
