  Mission: Converting a Decimal-to-Binary Converter from C++ to SystemC Code

Now that we have discussed the need to comprehend the C++ code, we will show you the route to converting it to System C.

Inputs and Outputs
The component requires two ports: one input (a) which provides the decimal number and one output (b) which is going to display the binary form of the number:

1. Input: a = '10'
Port runtime value: 2
2. Output: b = '1010'
Port runtime value: 10

Process Overview
The function converts a decimal number to its binary equivalent and then displays the value. The function takes one argument as input, which is the decimal number to be converted.

Blocks of Code
* Line 13 to 28: This block contains the loop that turns the decimal number into its binary counterpart through a series of division and remainder operations. Other than initialization, the block has only one assignment statement with remaining division as the operations besides the first line of that slide.
* Line 30 to 38: Declare the binaryNum array and perform a reverse traversal to print the binary numbers as normal.

**Explanation**:
To interpret the code and make the necessary replications, we can break it down by the essential computations. A decimal number is transformed into its binary equivalent through multiple operations, which serves as the core of the method.
* Input: 10 is utilized to convert this input into its corresponding binary equivalent.
* Loop: This block converts 10 into 1010. The loop's traversal is 10/2 = 5 and the remainder is 0. Again, the loop iterates, i = 10%2 = 0. The output binaryNum[0] = 0. Subsequently, 10 divided by 2 is taken, and 5 is produced. Next, the loop will check the remainder fraction, 5%2 = 1, and stop. The output binaryNum[1] = 1.
* Output: The binaryNum array is printed and presented in the end.

Here is the code for the System C synchronization and implementation of the required output ports and signals:
1. System CTOR Description
The SystemC adder block has two input ports: sc_in<int> variable and the output port sc_out<int> variable.

The Adder system synthesization takes place in the following steps:
* In the contruction of the protein, the input ports are exposed to the adder method.
* A reference is created to the output port of the adder function.

2. This allows the function to directly access the input integrals
* inside the adder method and write out the result to the output port.

SystemC block behavior:
* Indication at a traffic light
This signal is used only when a traffic light gives a change

All the signals are instantiated like shown in the sc_in and sc_out points and are named a, b, and sum.

* Connections: There are no explicit connections needed in this case.
* Reset and CP: No resetting or clock-on-posed required.

The result of the conversion is a high-level construct that holds equivalent logic from the C++ code. We used natural-language explanations at each stage to maintain clear readability.

SystemC Code:
```

#include <systemc.h>

// class Adder
class Adder : public sc_module {
public:
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;
    sc_out<int> sum;

    // constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder)
    {
        // sensitivity list
        sensitive << a << b;

        // process
        SC_METHOD(adder)

    }

    // adder function
    void adder()
    {
        int binaryNum[32];

        // loop counter
        int i = 0;

        // execute the loop
        while (n > 0)
        {
            // store the remainder
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;

            // divide by 2
            n /= 2;

            // increment counter
            i++;
        }

        // print binaryNum in reverse order
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
        {
            cout << binaryNum[j];
        }
    }
};

// instantiate the adder
sc_module system_tb("system_tb");

// register instances with the simulator
SC_METHOD(decToBinary)
{
    // Print the output.
    cout << decToBinary(a) << endl;
}
```
Inline elaboration of the supplied code:
    * #include <systemc.h> is imported
    * In the adder class, the following is declared:
    * void decToBinary(int n)

    * void main()
        * int n;
        * decToBinary(n);
    * void decToBinary(int n)
    * int binaryNum[32];
    * int i = 0;
    * while (n > 0)

   *  while(n>0)
    * cout << binaryNum[j];

In this module, the RESTART condition rewards declare a process to use the a decimal adder in binary form. The sensitivity list identifies how regulatory conditions (clocked signals and signals according to latency)prime the process upon transition. A method/process is generated in the adder class to take the supplied input adder value and generate binary form.  The SystemC code generation provides the equivalence logic of the logic presented in the natural language provided.
