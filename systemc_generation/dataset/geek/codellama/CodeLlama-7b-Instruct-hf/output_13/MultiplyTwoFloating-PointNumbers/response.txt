  To provide an equal SystemC code snippet that keeps the original logic, we must first analyze the original C++/C code; this code multiplies two float numbers using the mul_floatnumbers function.

The inputs to this code are two float parameters A and B, which are initialized to 1.2 and 3.0, respectively, in the main function. The output is the product of the two numbers, which is initialized on line 10 as 1.2 \* 3.0 = 3.6. 

The main function exercises the mul_floatnumbers function and obtains the product of the two numbers. The function runs the algorithm on the inputs and produces the scripted output - the product of A and B. Following the basic structure of the code snippet given earlier, competent SystemC developers could create and integrate code to evaluate this functionality using the input/output variables that are named and defined. 

The following is the SystemC translation of the C++/C code:

```
#include <systemc.h>

// A function that multiplies two floats using template
template <float mul_floatnumbers(float, float)> 

// The main function connects the input to the function
int main() { 

	// attributes initialization 
    float A = 1.2;
    float B = 3.0;
    float NProduct;

    // Function call
        NProduct =mul_floatnumbers(A, B);
        >Product (NProduct); 
        return 0; 
    }
```

In the output section, you can see that the function connects the input parameters A and B to the mul_floatnumbers function. The function produces the output, which is assigned to variable NProduct, and returned to 0. In the main function, you can see that the output is connected through the Product signal.

The example indicates how it works, utilizes recognition inputs and outputs; explains the attributes and signals of the system; and introduces a template function for a function.
