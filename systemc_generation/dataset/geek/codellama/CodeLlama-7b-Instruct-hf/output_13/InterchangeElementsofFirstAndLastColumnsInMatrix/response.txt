  The input to the code is a 2D array of integers. The first line of the code defines a constant `n`, which is used to create a 2D array of size `[n][n]`. The second line is a function `interchangeFirstLast` that swaps the elements of the first and last rows of the input array. The third line is the main function, where the input array is initialized and the `interchangeFirstLast` function is called to swap the rows. The output is the interchanged array, which is printed in the end.

In the SystemC code, we can translate the logic of the `interchangeFirstLast` function as follows:

1. Declare a 2D array `m` of size `[n][n]`.
2. Declare a variable `rows` to keep track of the number of rows in the array.
3. Iterate over each row in the array, from 0 to `n-1`.
4. In each iteration, create a temporary variable `t` to store the value in the row at index 0, and another temporary variable `t` to store the value in the row at index `rows-1`.
5. Swap the values in the row at index 0 and index `rows-1`, using the temporaries created in step 4.
6. Print the array at the end, using a nested loop to iterate over each row and column.

Here's the SystemC code:
```cpp
module Adder;
 
// Input ports
sc_in<int> in[n][n];

// Output ports
sc_out<int> out[n][n];

// Function to swap rows
void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n]) {
    int rows = n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int t = m[0][i];
        m[0][i] = m[rows - 1][i];
        m[rows - 1][i] = t;
    }
}

// Driver code
int main() {
    // Initialize the array
    int m[n][n] = {{8, 9, 7, 6}, {4, 7, 6, 5}, {3, 2, 1, 8}, {9, 9, 7, 7}};
    
    // Swap the rows
    interchangeFirstLast(m);
    
    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            out[i][j].write(m[i][j]);
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```
The input array is initialized in the main function, and the `interchangeFirstLast` function is called to swap the rows. The result is then printed using the `out` port. The `in` port is not used in this code, so it is not necessary to include it.

In summary, the C++/C code interchanges the elements of the first and last rows of a 2D array, and the SystemC code does the same thing, but with a separate module for the logic. The two codes are equivalent in terms of functionality and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.
