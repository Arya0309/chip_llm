  The provided C++/C code is a program to find the sum of the first n natural numbers. The inputs are the value of n, and the outputs are the sum of the first n natural numbers.

Here's a detailed natural language explanation of the code:

- The program includes the standard library header file "<iostream>" to access input and output streams.
- The program uses namespaces to avoid naming collisions. The "using namespace std" statement brings all the standard library components into the current scope.
- The program defines a function called "findSum" with one integer parameter called "n". The function returns the sum of the first n natural numbers.
- The function declares an integer variable called "sum" and initializes it to 0. It then uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to n and incrementally add the i-th natural number to sum.
- The function returns the value of sum.
- The program also defines a main function that reads an integer called "n" from the input stream and calls the "findSum" function with the value of "n" as its argument. The value returned by "findSum" is then printed to the output stream.

The inputs of the code are the value of n. The outputs are the sum of the first n natural numbers.

In order to preserve the logic of the provided C++/C source in a high-level synthesis flow, a SystemC code snippet can be generated as follows:

```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to compute the sum of the first n natural numbers
SC_MODULE(SumComputer) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> n;    // Input port for the value of n
    sc_out<unsigned int> result;  // Output port for the sum

    // Declaration of the findSum function
    sc_method<unsigned int> findSum;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SumComputer) {
        // Connect the input ports to the findSum method
        n.register_in(findSum);
        // Connect the result output port to the findSum method
        findSum.register_out(result);
    }

    // Natural numbers from 1 to n
    sc_method<unsigned int> naturalNumbers;

    // For loop to iterate from 1 to n and incrementally add the i-th natural number to sum
    sc_process_group naturalNumbersBlock;

    sc_method<unsigned int> sum;

    // Natural numbers from 1 to n
    sc_method<unsigned int> result;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SumComputer) {
        // Connect the input ports to the findSum method
        n.register_in(findSum);
        // Connect the result output port to the findSum method
        findSum.register_out(result);
    }

    // Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers
    void findSum() {
        unsigned int i = 0;
        sum = 0;
        for (i=1; i<n; i++) {
            sum = sum + i;
        }
        result = sum;
    }
};
```

In this code snippet, the natural numbers from 1 to n are calculated and stored in an array. The value of the sum variable is then calculated by iterating through the array and incrementally adding the natural numbers. The result variable is then assigned the value of the sum.
