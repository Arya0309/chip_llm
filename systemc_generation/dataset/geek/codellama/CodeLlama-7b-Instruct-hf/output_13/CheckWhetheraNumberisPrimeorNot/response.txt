  Code Summary

This C++ code is a C++ program to check whether an input is a prime number using simple trial division. It can be optimized but works well for small and medium-sized inputs. It inputs an integer "n", then checks whether it is less than or equal to one, if it is then it is not a prime number. 

Otherwise, the program verifies there are more than 2 numbers that divide "n". Then it outputs whether n is a prime number. 

The outputs are shown below:

- The input "n" (where the numbers to be verified are listed);
- Whatever "n" is found to be (prime or not).

// Summary
// This C++ program to verify whether a number is a prime number using
// simple trial division. It will output whether n is a prime number
//  or not.

SC_MODULE(Is_prime){

// Declare inputs
// Input for n
sc_in<int>  n;

// Output for whether n is prime.
sc_out<bool> is_prime;

// Constructor
// Initialize a boolean variable to keep track of whether n is a prime
// number or not.
// Initialize cnt to 0. Loop through i values from 1 to the value of n then
// if cnt is less than 2 after the loop, that means n only divided into 1 or
// itself so it's a prime number. If it divided into more than that, then it
//is not a prime number.
SC_CTOR(Is_prime){
    cnt = 0;
SC_METHOD(Is_prime);
sensitive << n;
}

// Is_prime Method
// Iterate through n's divisors
// Count how many divisors n has
// Check if n is a prime number
void Is_prime(){
  
int cnt = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
    if (n % i == 0){
        cnt++;
    }
}
    if (cnt> 2){
        cout << "is NOT prime" << endl;
    }
    else{
        cout << "is prime" << endl;
    }
}

// Return the value of is_prime
is_prime.write(cnt>2);

};

This C++ program's goal to determine whether a number is a prime number or not (i.e., no factors beside 1 and itself) is achieved with a prime number checker using trial division. This program is analogous to the original code in terms of its architecture and functionality, as it attempts to do the same thing in a more systematic and painstaking way.
