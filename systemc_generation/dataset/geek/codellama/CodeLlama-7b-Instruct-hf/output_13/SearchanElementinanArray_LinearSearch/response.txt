  C++/C Code: Linear Search Algorithm Iterative

This code implements a linear search algorithm iteratively. The inputs are a vector of integers and a key to search for, and the outputs are the index of the first occurrence of the key in the vector, or -1 if the key is not found. The code first creates a function called linearSearch that takes a vector and a key as inputs and returns the index of the first occurrence of the key in the vector, or -1 if the key is not found. The function then initializes a variable i, which keeps track of the current index in the vector, and iterates through the vector until it finds the key or reaches the end of the vector. If the key is found, the function returns the index of the element in the vector where it is located. If the key is not found, the function returns -1.

SystemC Snippet:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// linearSearch module
SC_MODULE(linearSearch) {
    // Vector of integers
    sc_in<sc_vector<int>> v;
    // Key to search for
    sc_in<int> key;
    // Output index of first occurrence of key, or -1 if key not found
    sc_out<int>` index;

    // Process to perform linear search
    SC_METHOD(performLinearSearch);
    sensitive << v << key;

    // Method to perform linear search
    void performLinearSearch() {
        // Start from the beginning of the vector
        int i = 0;

        // Keep iterating until we find the key or reach the end of the vector
        while (i < v.size() && v[i] != key) {
            // Increment i to go to the next element
            i++;
        }

        // If we found the key, return the index
        if (i < v.size()) {
            index.write(i + 1);
        }
        // Otherwise, return -1 to indicate key not found
        else {
            index.write(-1);
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    // Testbench
    vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};
    int key = 8;

    // Create a linearSearch module
    linearSearch linearSearch_module(v, key);

    // Connect the inputs and outputs of the module
    linearSearch_module.v(v);
    linearSearch_module.key(key);
    linearSearch_module.index(index);

    // Start the simulation
    sc_start();

    // Print the output of the simulation
    std::cout << "The index of the first occurrence of " << key << " in the vector is " << index << "\n";

    // End the simulation
    sc_stop();
    return 0;
}
```


This SystemC code creates a module named linearSearch that takes two inputs, a vector of integers and a key to search for, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the key in the vector, or -1 if the key is not found. The module uses a process to perform the linear search and an output port to return the index of the first occurrence of the key. The module also has a constructor that initializes the process and connects the input and output ports. In the main function, the linearSearch module is created, and the inputs are connected to the outputs of the module. The simulation is then started, and the output of the simulation is printed.

In this analysis, we have seen how a C++/C code implementing a linear search algorithm can be converted to a SystemC code that captures the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow. The resulting SystemC code uses the sc_in and sc_out keywords to declare inputs and outputs, and the sensitivity attribute to specify the inputs on which the module reacts. The while loop in the method to perform the linear search can be replaced with a more efficient linear search algorithm, and the method can also be simplified to just return the index of the element in the vector where the key is located.
