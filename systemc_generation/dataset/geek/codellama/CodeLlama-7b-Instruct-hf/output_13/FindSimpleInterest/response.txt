  ** Input(s) and output(s) **
This C++/C code calculates simple interest for a given principal amount, time, and interest rate. It takes in three inputs (P, R, and T) and one output (SI) as shown in the testbench.

** Explanation of Major Lines and Blocks **

The code starts with the inclusion of header files stdio.h, stdlib.h, and cmath. The header file keyboard.h is also included for getting inputs from the keyboard.

The line that specifies the inputs (P,R,T) and output (SI,) is " // We can change values here for different inputs ". This is a comment in the C++ syntax that provides an explanation for the code.

The next line specifies the function prototype for main, which is a function that is required when writing C++ code. Then, there's a variable definition. This variable is of the primitive data type float. With the variable initializations, the program calculates the simple interest for the requested principal amount, over a specified time, at the requested rate of interest.

After that, it enters an if statement. The condition inside the parentheses is the comparison of the three variables using the equal symbol, which compares the value of each of the variables with a specific integer. If the condition evaluates to true and meaningful hence, the statement inside the block is executed.
This block of code defines an if statement. Inside this branch, it uses the C++math library function pow() to calculate the powers of the principal amount, rate of interest, and time to arrive at the formula for the simple interest. A overloaded operator (Visual Studio help page) allows you to multiply one number or array by another.
A control statement. It is used to manage the flow of a consistent sequence of statements. This flow statement is set to the desired screen output (label output) where the output statement arrives. Essentially, this flow ensures the order in which your output is displayed.

Else code:
:
The else part of the if-else control statement instructs the program to execute the code it contains if none of the if branches correspond. In this case, the output S is printed or displayed.

** SystemC Code **

As the C++/C code relies on keyboard input and screen output, it cannot be converted to SystemC code as is. However, we can convert the logic of the calculation.

Let's look at the SystemC equivalent of the code below.

#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
	sc_in <int> a;  // Input port for the first number
	sc_in <int> b;  // Input port for the second number
	sc_out <int> sum; // Output port for the sum

	// Constructor
	SC_CTOR(Adder) {
		// Process to perform addition
		SC_METHOD(add);
		sensitive << a << b;
	}

// This code simulates an adder that adds two integers whose inputs and outputs are defined in ports.
void add() {
	int sums = a.read() + b.read();
	sums.write(sums);
}
};

We won't use rockets. Instead, we'll create SystemC code that emulates the logic of calculating simple interest. We will utilize the inputs and output variables defined in the notes.
```sc_ldf
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SimpleInterest) {
    sc_in<float> P;  // Principal amount 
  sc_in<float>R; // Rate of interest
  sc_in<float>T;// Time
  sc_out<float>SI;//Simple interest

  void do_calculate();   // Analog for main 

  // Constructor
  SC_CTOR(SimpleInterest) {
      // Process to find simple interest
      SC_METHOD(do_calculate); 
     SC_THREAD_forward_event<SC_POOL>; 
  }

  // Run_method
  void do_calculate() {
sc_time delay_string;
    std::string input;
    cout << " Please enter principal amount: ";
    cin >> P;
    cout << " Please enter rate of interest : ";
    cin >> R;
    cout << " Please enter time  : ";
    cin >> T;

    SI = (P * T * R) / 100.0;

    cout << "Simple interest = ";
    cout << SI;
cout << endl;

    } // Close do_calculate()
  }
};```

Going through the code, we see that SystemC provides similar functionality to C++; in particular, it introduces the concept of a flow controller, which is responsible for providing data into and data out of the block diagram. Similarly to C++, we define input variables (port variables, sc_in<float> P, SC_in<float>R, and SC_ in < float> b), output variables (SC_out<float>SI), then functions for reading input and writing output. It will use the input for the specified time, sending it to the output.

In general, we concentrate on the salient elements of the floating-point calculations in the program. In particular, we realize the three relevant variables (p, R, and T). We can subsequently generate input and output satisfied by SystemC signals, si, srp, and R rob S here by replacing PS, R, and T with their applicable ports AA

Scie ie interaction while tracking the program or the SystemC code's intent
```sc_ldf
  // Class declaration
class SC_Behavior1;  // default behavior
The behavior created is the default one. As a result, the results of the sc.h (SystemC header) include a class name; therefore, it must be capitalized.

SC_Behavior1 add(a,b); // In systemc.h
The add function constructs a calculation vector, representing the sum of the two series inputs.

void add() {  // Definition of the method add
sc_time delay_string;   // Delay String
int input1 = a.read() + S;  //int input1;
int input1 = S + b;    //int input2;
int input = input1 + input2;  //int input;
int result = input * 2;//int result;
    si.write(result);   //Ci1nd print result to the output   
   cout << " Simple Interest = " << si;
}

  SC_END_FALSE;

  ```

The following output memory formats the number of the input port and assigns it to the output port.


Input.
```h2
using namespace std;   
  int a = cin;     This uses widespread    operations system to open and take input.
int b = cin;
â€‹
  int c = a + b;
int se = c + 0.2;
c = c + 0.2;
```

This uses widespread controls to openAnd push the input.
