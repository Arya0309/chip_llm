  Input:

* A C++/C++ program that checks if a number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

Outputs:

* Inputs:
	+ `n_in`: Input port for the number to check if it can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
* Outputs:
	+ `result_out`: Output port indicating whether the number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

Summary:

This C++/C++ program uses a combination of functions to determine whether a number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The program first checks if the number `n` is prime, and then it checks if `n - 2` is prime using the same function `isPrime`. If both are true, then `true` is returned, otherwise `false` is returned. Finally, a `main` function calls this function with an integer input `n` and outputs the result.

SystemC Equivalent:

To generate a SystemC equivalent, we will need to rewrite the code to use SystemC constructs such as input and output ports, sensitivity lists, and synchronous always blocks.

Here's an implementation of the `isPrime` function in SystemC:
```scss
// SystemC equivalent of isPrime function
bool isPrime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
The `isPossible` function can be rewritten in a similar fashion:
```scss
// SystemC equivalent of isPossible function
bool isPossible(int N) {
    if (isPrime(N) && isPrime(N - 2)) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```
Finally, the `main` function can be implemented as follows:
```scss
// SystemC equivalent of main function
int main() {
    int n;
    bool result;
    sc_in<int> n_in("n_in");
    sc_out<bool> result_out("result_out");

    n = n_in.read();
    result = isPossible(n);
    result_out.write(result);

    return 0;
}
```
In this implementation, the `n_in` and `result_out` input and output ports are declared and connected to the corresponding SystemC inputs and outputs. The program reads the input `n` from the `n_in` port, calls the `isPossible` function, and writes the result to the `result_out` port. The program then returns 0.

Note that the SystemC code assumes that the input `n` is an integer, and that the output `result` must be a boolean value indicating whether the number `n` can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The output is written to the `result_out` port to ensure that it is delivered to the testbench.
