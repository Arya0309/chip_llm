  **Inputs and Outputs**:

The given C++/C code takes in a matrix `matrix[4][4]` of integers as input, and returns the determinant of that matrix as output. The input matrix is accessed through the `a` 2D array, and the determinant is computed and returned through the `det` variable. The output determinant is printed to the console using `std::cout`.

**Line-by-Line Explanation**:

1. The code includes the necessary header files for operating with matrices and performing calculations.
2. The constant integer `MAXN` is declared and set to 105. This value might be empirically determined later.
3. The `determinant` function is declared, which takes in an integer `n` as a parameter. The function initializes the determinant variable `det` to 1.0 and runs a loop with `i` ranging from 0 to `n` (i.e., `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`).
4. The variable `det` is multiplied by -1 if `i` is not equal to `pivot`, which is calculated from the array `a[j][i]` and `a[i][i]` and `i` by the `if` statement `if (abs(a[j][i]) > abs(a[pivot][i]))`. If two elements in a column are different by more than 2 times, the loop is rejected. The loop continues as long as `pivot` is not equal to `i`.
5. Inside the first loop, `a[i][i]` is set to 0.0 if `a[i][i]` is equal to 0.0. The reason for this is not entirely clear from the code.

6. The second loop starts with `for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++)` and sets each element in the array `a[j][k]` to 0 by subtracting the product `a[j][i] * a[i][k] / a[i][i]` from the corresponding element.
7. In the third loop, the determinant is returned by multiplying `det` by `a[i][i]`. The whole process goes on until `i` equals `n`.

   			int pivot = i		
   			for(int j = i + 1; j < SIZE; j++) 
   				if(abs(matrix[j][i]) > abs(matrix[pivot][i])) 
   					pivot = j
   			if(pivot != i) {
   				swap(matrix[i], matrix[pivot])
   				det *= -1
   			}
   			if(matrix[i][i] == 0) 
   				return 0
   			det *= matrix[i][i]
   			for(int j = i + 1; j < SIZE; j++) {
   				double factor = matrix[j][i] / matrix[i][i]
   				for(int k = i + 1; k < 105; k++) 
   				matrix[j][k] -= factor * matrix[i][k]
   				}
   			}
   		return det 
   	}
}
