  This is a C++/C code that calculates simple interest for a given principal amount, time, and rate of interest. based on the above input, we analyze the inputs, the output, and the code's functionality below.

Inputs:
The C++ code takes three inputs from the user. These include the principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

Outputs: 
 After calculating, the simple interest is sent to the main output, ะก.

Code:
To start, we declare the two input structs and the simple interest output value.
The main method of the code calculates the interest by multiplying the principal by the years and rate numbers. it finally prints the calculated interest at the output.

add the following SystemC code, it integrates seamlessly with our existing testbench. Here we assume the existence of thesc_in, sc_out, and cout variables and that we can utilize them to send output to the console.

#include <systemc.h>
int main(){ 
  float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1; // C++ program inputs
  float SI = (P * T * R) / 100; 
  SI = sc_out(float)(SI);
  cout <<"Simple Interest = " << SI;
  return 0;
  }

Note: The sc_in variable represents the input connection that drives the integer specified in the signa. The sc_out variable represents the output connection that sends data from the IT to the console. The coint signa is used to push the calculated SI value to the console.}

Based on the provided information, this code can be strapped into a SCAN flow to get the equivalent SystemC code that shows the logic.
