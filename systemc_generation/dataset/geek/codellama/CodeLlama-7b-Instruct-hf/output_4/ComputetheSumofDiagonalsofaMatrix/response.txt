  The provided C++/C code is a simple program that calculates the sum of two diagonals in a square matrix using SystemC. 

The input of the program is a square matrix sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE]; where SIZE is an integer const and sc_out<int> principal; sc_out<int> secondary; are used to store the result. 

Throughout the code, the input matrix is traversed by nested for loops. Using the logic that primary diagonals are those where i equals j, and secondary diagonals are those where the sum of i and j is equal to n-1, the code calculates the diagonal sums respectively and writes them to the outputs principal and secondary 

The main function contains int a[][MAX] = {{1, 2, 3, 4},...,where a is the matrix input.

The SystemC output of the code will also incorporate the signals matrix[SIZE]; principal ;secondary along with the output calculation using SystemC inputs and realization of the logic such that the program can form a complete system model
