  The provided C++/C code checks whether a number can be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers. Specifically, it defines two functions: `isPrime`, which checks whether a given number is prime, and `isPossible`, which checks whether a given number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The main function simply calls `isPossible` and prints "Yes" if it is true, and "No" otherwise.

Here is a line-by-line natural language summary of the code:

"This C++/C program defines two functions: `isPrime`, which checks whether a given number is prime, and `isPossible`, which checks whether a given number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The program defines a main function that simply calls `isPossible` and prints either "Yes" or "No" based on the result. The functions are both slightly complex, but the main function is straightforward."

Here is a block-by-block natural language summary:

"This C++/C program has three main blocks of code. The first block defines two functions: `isPrime`, which checks whether a given number is prime, and `isPossible`, which checks whether a given number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The second block defines the main function, which simply calls `isPossible` and prints either "Yes" or "No" based on the result. The third block is the driver code, which calls the main function and prints the result."

Here is the equivalent SystemC code snippet:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks whether a number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers
SC_MODULE(CheckPrime) {
    sc_in<int> n_in;  // Input port for the number
    sc_out<bool> result_out; // Output port for the result

    // Function to check whether a number is prime
    const int MAX_PRIME = 100; // Maximum prime number checked
    bool isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1)
            return false;  // 1 is not prime
        for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++)
            if (n % i == 0)
                return false;  // If the number is divisible by any number between 2 and sqrt(n), it is not prime
        return true;  // If no divisors are found, the number is prime
    }

    // Function to check if a number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers
    bool isPossible(int N) {
        if (isPrime(N) && isPrime(N - 2))
            return true;  // If the number and its difference of two are both prime, it can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers
        else
            return false;  // Otherwise, it cannot be expressed
    }

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CheckPrime) {
        // Call the isPossible function and print the result
        SC_METHOD(check);
        sensitive << n_in;
    }

    // Method to check the result
    void check() {
        result_out = isPossible(n_in.read());
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char **argv) {
    sc_report_handler::set_action_level(SC_FATAL);

    // Instantiate the checker module
    CheckPrime checkPrime("checkPrime");

    // Connect the inputs and outputs
    sc_signal<int> n_in("n_in");
    sc_signal<bool> result_out("result_out");
    n_in(checkPrime.n_in);
    result_out(checkPrime.result_out);

    // Run the simulation
    sc_start(10, SC_MS);

    // Print the result
    cout << "Result: " << result_out.read() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
Note that the SystemC code includes two input ports (`n_in` and `result_out`) that match the provided signals, and the `sc_start` method is used to run the simulation for 10 milliseconds.
