  This C++/C code fragments is simple function that finds the minimum and maximum values in a given array. First, it calculates the array length using the sizeof operator, and stores the value in variable n. The getMin() and getMax() functions are used to return the minimum and maximum values of the array

The input array is 12, 1234, 45, 67, and 1, respectively. This code will compute the minimum -1 and maximum -1234 The main() function of this program is to print the Minimum, and Maximum values of an array to the user. The two functions called GetMin() and GetMax() are defined earlier in the program, which seems to find the minimum and maximum values of the input array

This code will compute the minimum -1 and maximum -1234
The program will first calculate the array length using the sizeof operator, and store the value in variable n. Then, the main() function of this program is to print the Minimum, and Maximum values of an array to the user.

The two functions called GetMin() and GetMax() are defined earlier in the program, which seems to find the minimum and maximum values of the input array. A C++/C program can simply find the maximum or minimum value of an array using the GetMax() or GetMin() functions shown above.
There are plenty of other ways to write this behavior in SystemC. We can use a process that will execute logic identical to GetBound() using the max_element() and min_element() functions from the STL.
