  Input(s):

* A single binary number, represented as an integer.

Output(s):

* The decimal equivalent of the binary number.

Summary:

The provided C++/C code defines a function `binaryToDecimal` that takes a binary number (represented as an int) and returns its decimal equivalent. The function works by iterating over the binary representation of the input number and computing its decimal value by multiplying each binary digit (0 or 1) by the appropriate power of 2 (1 or 2) and summing the results.

Here is a detailed explanation of each major line or block of code:

1. `int num = n;` declares a local variable called "num" and initializes it to the value of the argument "n" passed to the function.
2. `int dec_value = 0;` declares a local variable called "dec_value" and initializes it to 0.
3. `int base = 1;` declares a local variable called "base" and initializes it to 1, representing the power of 2 that corresponds to the least significant digit in the binary representation of the number.
4. `int temp = num;` declares a local variable called "temp" and initializes it to the value of "num".
5. `while (temp)` loops until the variable "temp" is 0, indicating that all binary digits have been processed.
6. `int last_digit = temp % 10;` computes the least significant digit of "temp" (which represents the binary representation of the input number) and stores it in the variable "last_digit".
7. `temp = temp / 10;` updates "temp" to be the next binary digit in the input number.
8. `dec_value += last_digit * base;` computes the decimal value of the current binary digit (equal to the value of "last_digit" times the power of 2 corresponding to "base") and adds it to the current value of "dec_value".
9. `base = base * 2;` updates "base" to be twice the current value, representing the next power of 2 in the binary representation.
10. `return dec_value;` returns the computed decimal value of the input number.

Now, let's generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the original C++/C code.

SystemC Code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that converts binary to decimal
SC_MODULE(BinaryToDecimal) {
    sc_in<int> binary_in;     // Input port for the binary number
    sc_out<int> decimal_out;  // Output port for the decimal number

    // Function to convert binary to decimal
    void binaryToDecimal(int n) {
        int num = n;
        int dec_value = 0;
        int base = 1;

        while (num) {
            int last_digit = num % 10;
            num = num / 10;
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base = base * 2;
        }

        // Output the decimal equivalent of the binary number
        decimal_out.write(dec_value);
    }

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinaryToDecimal) {
        // Declare input and output ports
        SC_METHOD(binaryToDecimal);
        sensitive << binary_in;
    }
};

```

Note: The SystemC code above uses the same port names (`binary_in` and `decimal_out`) as the C++/C code, which makes it easier to integrate with the existing testbench.
