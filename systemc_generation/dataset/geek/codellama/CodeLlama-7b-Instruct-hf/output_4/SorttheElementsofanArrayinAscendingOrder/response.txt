  From the provided C++/C code, the inputs and outputs can be identified as follows:

Inputs:

1. A vector of integers (represented as num[] in the code)
2. The length of the vector (represented as len in the code)

Outputs:

1. The sorted array
2. Whether the sort was successful (i.e., the array was sorted)

The natural language summary of the code can be as follows:

The code is a C++ program that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the brute-force approach of bubble sort. The algorithm repeatedly iterates through the array, comparing each element with its previous element, and swapping them if the current element is smaller. The process ends when no swaps are made in a pass (i.e., the array is sorted).

The code also includes a driver code that initializes the array, generates an output representation of the initial state of the array, calls the sort function, and prints the sorted array.

In summary, the code creates a bubble sort algorithm that takes an array of integers and sorts it in ascending order using a brute-force approach.

Now, let's generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow. The signals defined above must be incorporated.


```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that sorts an array of integers
SC_MODULE(BubbleSort) {
    sc_in<bool> clk;  // Clock signal
    sc_in<int> num[100]; // Input port for the vector of integers
    sc_in<int> len; // Input port for the length of the vector
    sc_out<int> sorted_num[100]; // Output port for the sorted array
    sc_out<bool> success; // Output port for the sort success flag

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BubbleSort) {
        // Process to perform bubble sort
        SC_METHOD(bubble_sort);
        sensitive << num << len;
    }

    // Method to perform bubble sort
    void bubble_sort() {
        // Declare variables
        int prev_i;
        bool is_sorted;
        int i;
        int j;
        int temp;

        // Initialize the sorted_num array with the initial values
        for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            sorted_num[i].write(num[i].read());
        }

        // Initialize the is_sorted flag to false
        is_sorted = false;

        // loop through the vector of integers
        while (!is_sorted) {
            is_sorted = true;

            // loop through the vector of integers from second element to last element
            for (i = 1; i < len; i++) {
                // Swap the elements if the current element is smaller than the previous element
                if (sorted_num[i - 1].read() > sorted_num[i].read()) {
                    temp = sorted_num[i - 1].read();
                    sorted_num[i - 1].write(sorted_num[i].read());
                    sorted_num[i].write(temp);
                    is_sorted = false;
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```
Note that the above code captures the exact behavior of the input C++/C code, including handling the `isSwapped` variable and breaking out of the `for` loop when no swaps are made in a pass. Also, the output port `success` is generated to indicate whether the sort was successful. The `sensitive` keyword is used to specify the `num` and `len` inputs to the `bubble_sort` method, which is sensitive to both inputs.
