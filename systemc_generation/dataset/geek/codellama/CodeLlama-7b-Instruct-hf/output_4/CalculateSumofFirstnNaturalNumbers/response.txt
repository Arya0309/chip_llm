  C++/C Code:
Your input is a C++/C program that finds the sum of the first n natural numbers. Here is a natural language analysis:
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Returns sum of first n natural 
// numbers 
int findSum(int n) { 
	int sum = 0; 
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) 
		sum = sum + i; 
	return sum; 
} 

// Driver code 
int main() { 
	int n = 5; 
	cout << findSum(n); 
	return 0; 
}
```
The inputs of the code are not explicitly defined. The user must pass an input value of type int as a variable n to the program. The output will be a sum of the inputs. The code will run as long as the object is created. 
There are two major lines of code. The first is the line:
#include <iostream>
Project #095020	Fixing errors. He made the quotes correct and evented. He also had a portion of code outside the main file better. The second is int main():
The first line in int main() begins by initiating a vector space then ajdusting the frame with the default size of the current projects space. The second line inputs a number, in this case 5. The program adds the sum of the first five natural numbers, either variants are n wider. If n is less than one the program returns the sum of the only two natural numbers. The return statement ensures the sum displayed is the function invoked. 
The tool inputs 5 into the function that calculates the sum of the first four natural numbers, and returns the result, the sum of the numbers from one to 5, which is displayed by the program.
The outputs of this code are the output integers that the function summed, after passing them to cout, which displays it on the console. The functions takes no inputs. When the main function is activated, it outputs a response as to whether a value is less than or greater than one, which denotes that the particular sum has been computed. The values of the sum and the n number of given that n will end up at input is printed; this exception is only printed if n is less than one.  
Therefore, this function takes no inputs, and the sum of the first n integers, if given as a console input, is outputted after being added. As mentioned earlier, an integer n must be entered. This creates a console program that tells the user whether their sum is less than 1, greater than 1, or that the actual sum's given, followed by a console message that states n is 1, 2, or 3.
