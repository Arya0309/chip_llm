  The given C++/C code is a simple program that calculates compound interest for a principal amount, interest rate, and time period. The code defines three input variables: `principal`, `rate`, and `time`, and one output variable: `ci`. The program calculates the compound interest by taking the principle amount, interest rate, and time period as inputs and storing them in variables. The program then uses the inputs to calculate the compound interest and stores the output in the variable `CI`. Finally, the program outputs the compound interest using `std::cout<<`.

The provided C++/C code has the following inputs and outputs.

**Inputs:**

* `principal`: double represents the principal amount.
* `rate`: double represents the interest rate.
* `time`: double represents the time period.

**Outputs:**

* `ci`: double represents the compound interest.

The C++/C code can be divided into three major parts:

1. Declarations: The code starts by defining some variable types and names. The code also includes a comment denoting the contribution of the code to this problem.
2. Driver code: The code calls this function `main()` which sets the initial values of `principal`, `rate`, and `time`, and calculate the compound interest using the formula `((pow((1 + rate / 100), time)) - principal)`. Finally, the code outputs the compound interest using `std::cout<<`.

The SystemC code generated from the C++/C code should preserve the functionality present in the original code and should utilize the input/output signals provided in the question. Based on the above discussions, the SystemC code generated from the C++/C code is as follows:


\include {media/CtoSystemC.cpp}

\include {media/SystemCtoC.cpp}

Using the `SystemC` class, we can create a module to calculate the compound interest with inputs and outputs as specified above.

To map the inputs and outputs from the SystemC code to the C++/C code, we can use the given input and output signals:
> sc_in<double> principal;
sc_in<double> rate;
sc_in<double> time;
sc_out<double> ci;

In the SystemC code snippet above, the input values are read from the input signals `sc_in<double> principal`, `sc_in<double> rate`, and `sc_in<double> time`. The output value `ci` is written to the output signal `sc_out<double> ci`.

Finally, the SystemC code could be compiled and mostly represented in the question.
