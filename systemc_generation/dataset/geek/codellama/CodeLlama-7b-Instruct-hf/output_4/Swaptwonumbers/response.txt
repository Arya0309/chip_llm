  To begin, we can ask a few questions to help us better understand the code.

* Intended meantime what does this code achieve? What functionality does it contain?
* Are there any major inclusions or frameworks that we must be mindful of?
* What data types are we dealing with?
* Is the ideal input or output something we must specify?
* Is any distinction made between procedures and commands?

Let us look at the inputs and outputs of the provided C++/C code. The formatted contents might make sense once we get to know about these concepts. As a result, the following are the inputs and outputs of the code:

INPUTS:
- Variable A and B. A and B are known as variables in program development terminology. As far as some specific point of data representing one significant aspect of the program is concerned, the word variables is used instead of the word "variables".
- Structs have been brought also.

OUTPUTS
- Another type is a variable which does so since one data unit is the output equivalent to a variable.

As a programming language, C++ is renowned for how it can produce CPU-efficent performance and is also fast for processing numerous data items. C++ code allows the programming language to punch beyond what would otherwise have been possible. In this C++ code, the swap method instructs the compiler to manipulate two parameters. With the swap function, we can swap two variables without using any temporary variable. Instead, it uses the third variable.

The method includes two parameters of type int. The method changes the value of these variables by including a temporary variable. The swap() method modifies the value of a and b by swapping the values with those of the temporary variable, temp. The method finally uses the third variable to store the values of both a and b so that there is no loss of data while swapping the variables.

A debugging tool will provide us with valuable feedback and vital information like the method implementations and the utilized variables. As the C++ code comprises less than 20 lines, we can read the entire method's context and have an informed idea regarding what  it's doing. The development environment also assist in the streamlining of the application having numerous assisting tools.


```

//     C Header file (Swap.h)
#ifndef SWAP_H
#define SWAP_H

    int swap(int a, int b);

#endif // SWAP_H
```


```

//     C Source file
#include "Swap.h"

    int swap(int a, int b){

//local  temporary variable
int temp=0;

//assign the value of a to temp
temp=a;

//assign value for b to a
a=b;

//assign value of a to b
b=temp;

}

```


To simplify the process and make it more straightforward, we can create a method to swap the values of two numbers without considering the third variable.


```

# include <stdio.h>
//method
void swapNumbers(int*a, int* b){
int c;
c=*a;*a=*b;*b=c;
 }
 int main() {
//declare two variables
int num1,num2;
//assign integer literal
int to_get = 10;
//assign the number to variables
num1 = to_get;
num2 = to_get;
//swap num1 and num2 values
swapNumbers(&num1,&num2);
//print both num1 and num2
printf("Number 1 is: %d\n", num1);
printf("Number 2 is: %d\n", num2);
}

```

To create a module in SystemC, which models the same functionality as the original C++/C source, we may accomplish a number of things such as a single method for swapping the values of two data items.

Additionally, we must make certain that any inputs and outputs match the definitions we requested.
The sum.io in the given code defines the output as an integer variable. To model this in SystemC, we may accept an integer input from the given signal.

Here is an example of how a casting method can be used to model the same functionality as the C++/C code.


```

/*  Casting Class
 *
 */

void explicit Casting(sc_in<int> a, sc_dataout<int> b){
b.write(a.read());
}

```
Several lines of code that show creating the Casting class are provided here with the following characteristics.
The method Constructor appears to be the first line of code. I gave the newly created data ports the same names as "s_in<int> a" and "sc_dataout<int> b" because the signal names need to be consistent throughout the code.
The first line indicates that "a"'s value should be sent where "b" refers.


```
//systemC code
#include <systemC.h>

//Swap class
class template swapper{
public:
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_out<int> b;
    sc_temp<int> temp;

    void swapper(sc_module C)->{

        //assignment
        // in sc_mem, values can be copied by means of the = operator.
        b=a;
        sc_ppt::sc_cast<temp>

        swc_ asc_to<int> test (" a " )
        sc_temp ASc;
        sc_eliere ASC = temp.to_base();

        // random move operation from a to temp and the move from A to B
        temp.move(a);
        a.move(b);
    }
};
```
