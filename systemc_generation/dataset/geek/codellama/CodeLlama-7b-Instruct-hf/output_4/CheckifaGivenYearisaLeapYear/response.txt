  The input to this C++ program is an integer `year`, and the output is a boolean indicating whether `year` is a leap year or not.

The code first checks if `year` is divisible by 400, which makes it a leap year. If not, the code checks if `year` is divisible by 100 but not by 400, which makes it a non-leap year. Finally, if `year` is divisible by 100 but not by 4, it is also a non-leap year.

The generated SystemC code should be similar, but not identical, to the original C++/C code. The SystemC code should include the same logic but with different inputs and outputs, and should utilize the signals defined above.

SystemC Code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LeapYear) {
    sc_in<int> year;
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;

    SC_CTOR(LeapYear) {
        SC_THREAD(check_year);
    }

    void check_year() {
        if (year % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(1);
        }
        else if (year % 100 == 0 && year % 400 != 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(0);
        }
        else if (year % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(1);
        }
        else {
            is_leap_year.write(0);
        }
    }
};
```

The SystemC code utilizes the `year` input and `is_leap_year` output signals, and facially captures the logic of the C++/C program. It is important to note that the SystemC code is not a direct translation of the original C++/C code, but it effectively preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.
