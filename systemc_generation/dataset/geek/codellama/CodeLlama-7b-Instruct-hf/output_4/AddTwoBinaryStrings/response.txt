  The given C++/C code performs addition of two binary strings.

The C++/C code defines a function `addBinary()` with two inputs `A` and `B`, both of type `string`, and one output `sum`, also of type `string`. The function first checks if the length of `A` is greater than the length of `B`, and swaps the values of `A` and `B` and `res` if it is, similar to recursion. If the lengths are equal, the function calculates the difference between the lengths of both strings, initializes a `padding` string of the necessary length with zeroes and concatenates `A` with the `padding`.

The function then interates over the elements of `A` and `B` in reverse order, using a `char` variable `carry` to tackle the possible cases of `110`, `000`, `100`, `001`, `101`, `010`, and `011` for each position. For each position, the function also checks the base case of `A[i] == '1' && B[i] == '1'` and the recursive case of `A[i] != B[i]`. The computation of the addition is similar to long multiplication with the difference being that the modulus is 2. In the `res` variable, the relationship between the current position in `A` and `B` is recorded. After reversing the order of `res`, all leading zeroes are removed.

In the main function, a default `a` and `b` are defined with values `"1101"` and `"100"` respectively. The result of the addition is written to `sum`.

From a high-level perspective, the input to the program consists of two binary strings `A` and `B` and the output is the result of their addition.

As a system-level designs incorporates the signals, the three inputs are `A` and `B`, `sc_in<std::string>`, and the output is `sum`, `sc_out<std::string>`.
