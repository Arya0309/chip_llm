  The provided C++/C code is a program that finds the sum of the elements on the diagonal and secondary diagonal of an NxN matrix. The input to the program is an NxN matrix represented as a 2D array, and the output is two integers, representing the sum of elements on the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively.

The program uses a loop to iterate over the elements of the matrix, and checks whether each element is on the diagonal or the secondary diagonal. If an element is on the diagonal, the program adds its value to the total sum of the diagonal elements. If an element is on the secondary diagonal, the program adds its value to the total sum of the secondary diagonal elements.

The output of the program is the total sum of elements on the principal and secondary diagonals, which are printed to the console.

Based on this analysis, an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the original C++/C code would be:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module for finding the sum of elements on the principal and secondary diagonals
SC_MODULE(DiagonalSums) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE][SIZE]; // Input port for the matrix
    sc_out<int> principal; // Output port for the sum of principal diagonals
    sc_out<int> secondary; // Output port for the sum of secondary diagonals

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSums) {
        // Process to find the sum of the diagonal elements
        SC_METHOD(find_diagonal_sums);
        sensitive << matrix;
    }

    // Method to find the sum of the diagonal elements
    void find_diagonal_sums() {
        int principal_sum = 0;
        int secondary_sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                // Condition for principal diagonal
                if (i == j) {
                    principal_sum += matrix[i][j];
                }

                // Condition for secondary diagonal
                if (i + j == SIZE - 1) {
                    secondary_sum += matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        principal.write(principal_sum);
        secondary.write(secondary_sum);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the module takes an NxN matrix as input and outputs the sum of the elements on the principal and secondary diagonals. The output ports `principal` and `secondary` are used to store the sum of the diagonal elements. The process `find_diagonal_sums()` is sensitive to the input `matrix[]` to ensure that the code only triggers the summation process when the input matrix is available. The loop iterates over the elements of the matrix and checks whether each element is on the diagonal or the secondary diagonal. If an element is on the diagonal, the value is added to the total sum of the diagonal elements. If an element is on the secondary diagonal, the value is added to the total sum of the secondary diagonal elements. The output ports `principal` and `secondary` are used to store the final sums.
