  The provided C++/C code calculates the compound interest for a given principal, rate, and time. The code takes in these values as input parameters (principal, rate, and time) and uses them to calculate the compound interest (CI) using the formula:
```
CI = principal * ((1 + rate/100)^time) - principal
```
The output of the code is the calculated value of CI.

The natural language summary of the code is as follows:

The code begins by declaring variables for the principal, rate, and time parameters, and initializing them to 10000, 5, and 2 respectively.

Next, the code calculates the compound interest using the formula defined above. This involves calculating the double value of the principal, then applying the formula using the power function, and then subtracting the principal from the resulting value to obtain the compound interest.

Finally, the code prints the calculated value of CI to the console.

Based on this analysis, the equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic is as follows:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CompoundInterest) {
    sc_in<double> principal;
    sc_in<double> rate;
    sc_in<double> time;
    sc_out<double> ci;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(CompoundInterest) : ci("ci") {
        // Process to calculate compound interest
        SC_METHOD(calculate_ci);
        sensitive << principal << rate << time;
    }

    // Method to calculate compound interest
    void calculate_ci() {
        // Calculate the double value of the principal
        double A = principal.read() * (pow(1 + rate/100, time));
        // Calculate the compound interest
        double CI = A - principal.read();
        // Assign the output value
        ci.write(CI);
    }
};

```
In this SystemC code, the input variables (principal, rate, and time) are used as inputs to the module, while the output variable (ci) is used as the output of the module. The calculate_ci() method is a process that uses the formula to calculate the compound interest, and the resulting value is assigned to the ci_output.

To integrate this code with the existing testbench, the sc_in and sc_out ports must be connected to the appropriate signals declared in the testbench.
