  This task is to analyze the provided C++/C code and generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic. First, let's focus on the inputs and outputs of the provided source code.

The input of the code is a pair of integers; the dividend and divisor. This data is entered by the user using the standard input stream (cin). These inputs are then used to find the quotient and remainder of the division. Ultimately, these values are also served as outputs.

Based on this analysis, let's turn to the provided source code. The first important block of code is the `main()` function. Its primary responsibility is to prompt the user for the dividend and divisor, and to check for the divisor not being 0 before proceeding with the calculation (i.e., throwing an error message if the divisor is). Even though the quotient and remainder are outputs of the program, they are not explicitly listed as outputs. Therefore, we will consider them as outputs but with the caveat that their response will be based on the inputs provided. 

Given the code block, line by line, it is clear that it acts as an interface between the user and calculates the quotient and remainder. For understandability, there is a variety of data management (declaration of variables like `Dividend`,`Quotient`, `Divisor`, and `Remainder`), instructions/control flow statements such as "outputs will be assigned during the calculation of divisibility", and several data input/output streams (leading to the focus of our example). These developments continue until the division is checked.
The "if statement" signifies that only when the divisor is significantly divided, the remainder can be given; if the divisor is 0, the final exception message will be produced on the screen. Between the "if statement" and the "else statement", the divisibility is checked. Once the divisibility is established, the quotient and remainder are finessed by divided and modulus.

The calculation itself is till done line by line. The quotient input is divided by the divisor variable. Likewise, the dividend is divided by the divisor. This function ensures both the quotient and the remainder are delivered. Namely, the comments in the source declare a remainder variable – upon the completion of a division the activity– which allows outputting the remainder that is obtained when it is divided. To bind the remainder, the remainder unit input is used.

In summary, there are two inputs (Dividend, Divisor) and two outputs (Quotient, Remainder). To verify divisibility, checks are made; if 0 is given as the divisor, an exception would generate in signal of error. If divisibility is successful, quotient and remainder are calculated and outputted as dividend/divisor. 

Here is the SystemC code snippet that represents this functionality:
```scss
#include<systemc.h>

int status;
sc_in<int> Dividend, Divisor, Quotient, 
    Remainder;
sc_out<int> status;

SC_MODULE(divident) {
    SC_CTOR(divident) {
        SC_METHOD(get_info);
        sensitive << Dividend << Divisor;
    }

    void get_info() {
        if (Divisor == 0) {
            status.write(0);
        } else {
            Quotient.write(Dividend / Divisor);
            Remainder.write(Dividend % Divisor);
            status.write(1);
        }
    }
};
```
This SystemC code has the same flow of operations as the C++/C code. It has two inputs (Dividend, Divisor), and it has two outputs (Status, Quotient + Remainder). Even though Stauts itself serves as an output but is also considered an input because it determines whether error are to be produced based on the divisibility of the inputs. Inputs Dividend, Divisor work as inputs to Quotient and Remainder, which serves as an intermediary variable programmed into output to the user.
