  The input to this C++ code is two complex numbers represented by the `real1` and `imag1` input signals, and `real2` and `imag2` input signals. The output of the code is the sum of the two complex numbers represented by the `real_sum` and `imag_sum` output signals.

Line-by-line explanation of the code:

* The user-defined `Complex` class is defined, which has two member variables `real` and `imaginary` and a constructor to accept real and imaginary parts as inputs.
* The `addComp` method is defined to add the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers, and returns the sum as a new complex number.
* The `main` function declares two instances of the `Complex` class, `C1` and `C2`, and initializes them with real and imaginary parts.
* The `addComp` method is called to add the two complex numbers and stores the sum in a temporary variable `temp`.
* The real and imaginary parts of the sum are extracted from `temp` and printed as a complex number.

To generate an equivalent SystemC code, we can define a module that takes two `sc_in` signals of `int` type (one for each real and imaginary part) and generates two `sc_out` signals representing the sum of the two complex numbers. Here's an example SystemC code snippet:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two complex numbers represented by sc_in signals
SC_MODULE(ComplexAdd) {
    sc_in<int> real1; // Input signal for real part of first complex number
    sc_in<int> imag1; // Input signal for imaginary part of first complex number
    sc_in<int> real2; // Input signal for real part of second complex number
    sc_in<int> imag2; // Input signal for imaginary part of second complex number

    sc_out<int> real_sum; // Output signal for real part of sum
    sc_out<int> imag_sum; // Output signal for imaginary part of sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(ComplexAdd) {
        SC_METHOD(add); // Process to perform addition
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2; // Sensitivity list
    }

    // Method to add the two complex numbers
    void add() {
        int real_sum_temp = real1.read() + real2.read(); // Real part of sum
        int imag_sum_temp = imag1.read() + imag2.read(); // Imaginary part of sum
        real_sum.write(real_sum_temp);
        imag_sum.write(imag_sum_temp);
    }
};
```
This SystemC code takes the input signals `real1` and `imag1` for the first complex number, `real2` and `imag2` for the second complex number, and generates the output signals `real_sum` and `imag_sum` representing the sum of the two complex numbers. The `add` method performs the addition of the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers and writes the sum to the output signals. The sensitivity list for the `add` method ensures that the method is triggered only when any of the input signals changes value.
