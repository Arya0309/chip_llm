  Inputs:

* a and b: two integers as inputs to the modulo arithmetic gcd function.
* Main function: a main function that takes in a and b as input and calls the gcd functions.

Outputs:

* The output of the gcd function.

Task 1:
The provided code defines two functions, gcd and main. The gcd function takes in two integer values, a and b, as inputs and returns their gcd, which is the smallest positive number that leaves no remainder when divided by both a and b. Please put the logic of these functions in a step-by-step approach, line-by-line or block-by-block, and explain what they do or what line of code accomplishes.

A is the minimum of the integers a and b that are input, res is the counter for the search process, and gcd_result is the result of the gcd function.

1. Find the minimum of a and b, which is verified to be a and b by default settings for res. The value to be incremented or decremented by the while loop determines the remaining conditions for the loops.
2. Output manipulation in the code, the values of a and b are communicated from the recieving side (the console) in order to get the gcd_result.

Task 2:
Generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in the high-level synthesis flow.

#include <systemc>

// Custom module to find the Greatest Common Divisor of two numbers based on Euclid's algorithm
SC_MODULE(GCD_module)
{
  //public fifo ports
  sc_fifo_in<int> a; //input value for the first number
  sc_fifo_in<int> b; //input values of the second number
  sc_fifo_out<int> gcd_result; //output value for the gcd

  // Define a counter variable and declare its inputs and outputs
  int count;

  // Loop that searches for GCDs in the sorted array
  sc_loop search_GCD()
  {
    count = 1; // initialization is 1 (2 in Euclid's method)

    // While the counter (or loop iteration) is below the input parameters, a and b,
    while(count <= a && count <= b) // this line counts from 1 to a and b.
    {
      // If the remainder of dividing the first or second parameter is 0, then
      if (a % count == 0 || b % count == 0)
        // stop the search as the GCD has been found, and break out of the search loop
        break;
      else // Upon finding that there is no remainder, the value of the counter is decremented and the algorithm reiterates
        scanf("COUNT = %d\n", &count);
    }
    getchar();
    // Return the result of the GCD search by breaking the loop
    gcd_result.write(count);
  }
};

int main()
{
  //fifo ports for inputs and outputs
  //declares the two variables to be passed through fifos
  sc_in<int> a;
  sc_in<int> b;
  sc_out<int> gcd_result;

 
}

This code was modified to suit systemc's code syntax, in which the words have longer names, as the code aims to serve as a high-level synthesis function and integrates better with our previous testbench code. The input variables a and b were converted to fifos to ensure compatibility.
