  **Inputs**:

* The input matrix, `int m[][n]` with size `n x n`.

**Outputs**:

* The interchanged matrix, `int m[][n]` with the first column replaced by the last column and vice versa.

**Line-by-line Summary**:

1. `#include <iostream>` includes the standard input/output library.
2. `using namespace std;` brings the common namespaces into scope for convenience.
3. `const int n = 4;` defines the size of the matrix, `n x n`, and the number of iterations in the loops.
4. `void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n])` is a function that takes a matrix of size `n x n` as input and interchanges the first and last columns of the matrix.
5. `// swapping of element between first` and `last columns` comments the swapping of elements between the first and last columns of the matrix.
6. `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` loops through each row of the matrix.
7. `int t = m[i][0];` initializes `t` with the element at the first column of the current row.
8. `m[i][0] = m[i][n - 1];` replaces the element at the first column of the current row with the element at the last column.
9. `m[i][n - 1] = t;` replaces the element at the last column of the current row with the element in `t`.
10. `}` closes the inner loop.
11. `}` closes the outer loop.
12. `// Driver function` comments the driver function.
13. `int main()` declares the main function and initializes the matrix.
14. `interchangeFirstLast(m);` calls the `interchangeFirstLast` function with the input matrix `m`.
15. `// printing the interchanged matrix` comments the print statement.
16. `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` loops through each row of the interchanged matrix.
17. `for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)` loops through each column of the current row.
18. `cout << m[i][j] << " "; cout << endl;` prints the elements of the current row and a newline.
19. `} ` closes the first loop.
20. `return 0;` returns 0, indicating successful completion.
21. `}` closes the main function.

**SystemC Code**:

The provided C++/C code can be easily integrated into a SystemC model using the provided inputs and outputs. Here's an example SystemC code that captures the same logic:
```scss
#include <systemc>

void interchangeFirstLast(int m[n][n]) {
  // swapping of element between first and last columns
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int t = m[i][0];
    m[i][0] = m[i][n - 1];
    m[i][n - 1] = t;
  }
}

void top() {
  // input in the array
  int a[n][n] = {{8, 9, 7, 6}, {4, 7, 6, 5}, {3, 2, 1, 8}, {9, 9, 7, 7}};

  // call the function
  interchangeFirstLast(a);

  // print the interchanged matrix
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      cout << a[i][j] << " ";
      cout << endl;
    }
  }
}
```
The `interchangeFirstLast` function and the `top` function are straightforward translations of the provided C++/C code. The only significant difference is the use of SystemC `sc_in` and `sc_out` ports instead of `std::iostream` and the `main` function definition.

The SystemC code can be further optimized and formalized for high-level synthesis by introducing appropriate type definitions and casting the matrix elements to the desired data type. However, the primary takeaway from this example is the ease of translation from C++/C to SystemC using the provided inputs and outputs.
