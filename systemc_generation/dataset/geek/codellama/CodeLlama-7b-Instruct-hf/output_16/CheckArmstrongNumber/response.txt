  The provided C++/C code is a program that takes an integer n as input and checks whether it is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of three. 

Here is a natural language summary of the code:

The program begins by defining the variable n and setting its value to 153. It then creates a temporary variable called temp that is set to n, and initializes the temp variable to 0 for the duration of the program. 

The program then loops through the digits of the number n and computes the sum of the cube of each digit by iterating over each digit using a modulo and division operator. The value of loop is stored in the variable p. It is then determined whether the value of p is equal to the input number or not, and a string that indicates whether the input number j is an Armstrong number or not. 

Based on the analysis of the natural language explanation, here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the C++/C code and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:

```
#include <systemc.h>
SC_MODULE(Arnstrong_checker) {
    sc_in<int> num_in;
    sc_out<bool> is_arnstrong;
    sc_signal<int> n;
    SC_CTOR(Arnstrong_checker)
        SC_METHOD(check_Arnstrong);
        sensitive << num_in;
        n.write(num_in.read());
    }
void check_Arnstrong() {
    if (n.read() == 0) {
        is_arnstrong.write(false);
        return;
    }
    int n = num_in.read();
    int temp = n;
    int p = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
        int rem = n % 10;
        p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
        n = n / 10;
    }
    if (temp == p)
        is_arnstrong.write(true);
    else
        is_arnstrong.write(false);
}

```
