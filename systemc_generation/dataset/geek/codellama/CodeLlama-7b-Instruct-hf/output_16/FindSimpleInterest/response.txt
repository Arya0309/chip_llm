  The provided C++/C code calculates the simple interest for a given principal amount, time, and rate of interest.

Inputs:

* P: Principal amount (float)
* R: Rate of interest (float)
* T: Time (float)

Outputs:

* SI: Simple interest (float)

Behavioral Summary: The code first calculates SI by multiplying P, T, and R and then dividing the result by 100. The value of SI is then printed to the console using cout.

Equivalent SystemC Code:
```scss
// C++ program to find simple interest for given principal amount, time, and rate of interest.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// Driver code
int main()
{
	// We can change values here for different inputs
	float P = 1, R = 1, T = 1;

	// Calculate simple interest
	float SI = (P * T * R) / 100;

	// Print the resultant value of SI
	cout << "Simple Interest = " << SI;

	return 0;
}
```
The equivalent SystemC code is straightforward and faithfully captures the logic of the original source code. The main difference is that the inputs are system ports (e.g., <sc_in <float> P>) instead of variables with fixed values.

For testbench integration, you can include the following ports in your SystemC code:

<sc_in <float> P, R, T, SI>
</pre>
These ports are equivalent to the input arguments of the original C++ function and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow. Overall, the SystemC code provides a valid and efficient implementation of the simple interest calculator.
