  Task: Generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.

* **Inputs**: Signal <int> year for the input to the function checkYear().
* **Outputs**: Signal<bool> is_leap_year for the function checkYear()'s output.

Note
The generated SystemC code must utilize the provided signals (or equivalent named ports) so it can integrate seamlessly with the existing Testbench.

 Structured Analysis of the C++/C Code:

The provided C++/C program has the following components:

* Function declarations:
	+ checkYear(int year): This function checks if the input year is a leap year.
	+ main(): This is the function that calls the checkYear() function.

* Driver Code:
	+ The following line of code in the `main()` function calls the `checkYear()` function and sends the year 2000 as an input:

		`checkYear(year) ? cout << "Leap Year" : cout << "Not a Leap Year";`

* Logic related to the `checkYear()` function:
	+ The logic Flow of the checkYear() function is as follows:

		- First, the program checks if the input year is divisible by 400 in the first if statement.
		- If Yes, then the program returns true indicating that the year is a leap year.
		- If No, the program continues to the next conditional statement.
		- Second, the program checks if the input year is divisible by 100.
		- If Yes, this is a non-leap year because it is divisible by 100 but not by 400.
		- If No, the program continues to the third conditional statement.
		- Third, the program checks if the input year is divisible by 4.
		- If Yes, this is a leap year because it is divisible by 4.
		- If No, then the program returns false indicating that the input year is not a leap year.

Function Statements of checkYear():

Let us analyze each of these in detail:

* **IF statement** : `if (year % 400 == 0)`
This statement utilizes the modulo operator to check if the input year is divisible by 400. The program will execute the corresponding if statement only if the year is a leap year.

* **ELSE IF statement** :

`else if (year % 100 == 0)`

The else if statement checks if the input year is divisible by 100, but not divisible by 400. Since leap years are also divisible by 4, this conditional check is redundant, but the program covers all possible scenarios of a year not being a leap year.

* **ELSE IF statement**

`else if (year % 4 == 0)`

The else if statement checks if the input year is divisible by 4. Leap years are only divisible by 4, therefore this conditional check identifies whether a given year is a leap year.

* **ELSE statement**

`else {
	return false;`

This statement serves as a catch-all to return a result whenever the input year is not divisible by any of the above factors. This covers scenarios where the year is neither divisible by 4, 100, nor 400.

Final Generated SystemC Code:
```
// C++ program to check if a given year is a leap year or not

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to check leap year
bool checkYear(int year)
{
if year % 400 == 0 {
 return true;
}
else if year % 100 == 0 {
 return false;
}
else if year % 4 == 0 {
 return true;
}
else {
 return false;
}
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
int year = 2000;
checkYear(year) ? cout << "Leap Year" : cout << "Not a Leap Year";
return 0;
}
```
The module is declared in the code block with the checkYear function. The outputs include the year input (1) and is_leap_year output (2).
