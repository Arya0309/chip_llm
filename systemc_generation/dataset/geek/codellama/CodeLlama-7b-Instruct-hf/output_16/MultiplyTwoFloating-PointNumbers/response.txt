  C++/C Code:
```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to multiply two floating-point numbers
float mul_floatnumbers(float a, float b) {
    return a * b;
}

int main() {
    float A = 1.2, B = 3.0, product;

    // Calling mul_floatnumbers function
    product = mul_floatnumbers(A, B);

    // Printing the output
    cout << product << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
Inputs:

* Two floating-point numbers `a` and `b` are declared as inputs to the program.

Outputs:

* The product of the numbers `a` and `b` is declared as an output of the program.

Explanation:
The program declares two inputs, `A` and `B`, of type `float`. These inputs represent the two floating-point numbers to be multiplied. The program then calls a user-defined function, `mul_floatnumbers`, to multiply the numbers and obtain the product. The output of the program is the product calculated by the `mul_floatnumbers` function.

SystemC Code:
```sc
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that multiplies two floating-point numbers
SC_MODULE(multiplier) {
    sc_in<float> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<float> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<float> product; // Output port for the product

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(multiplier) {
        // Process to perform multiplication
        SC_METHOD(mul);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to multiply the two numbers
    void mul() {
        product.write(a.read() * b.read());
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we define a module called `multiplier` that has three ports: three inputs `a` and `b` (representing the two floating-point numbers to be multiplied), and one output `product` (representing the product of the two numbers). The module has a constructor that initializes the process method to perform multiplication using the `mul` method. The `mul` method uses the multiplicative operator `*` to obtain the product of the two numbers and write it to the output `product`.

The inputs `a` and `b` are connected to the `mul` method through the `sensitive` keyword, which indicates that the method should be called again whenever there is a change in the inputs. The output `product` is also connected to the `mul` method, which allows the method to modify the output value as needed.
