  C++/C Code Analysis and Conversion to SystemC
================================================================

The given C++/C program is a simple example of swapping two numbers using a third variable. The program is self-contained and does not require any external libraries or headers.

Inputs:
-------
The program takes two integer inputs `a` and `b` through the user interface. The values are then assigned to the variables with the same names.

Outputs:
-------
The program prints the swapped values of `a` and `b` to the console. The output is also saved in the variables with the same names.

Logic:
-----
The program uses a temporary variable `temp` to swap the values of `a` and `b`. The algorithm works as follows:

1. The value of `a` is stored in `temp`.
2. The value of `b` is stored in `a`.
3. The value of `temp` is stored in `b`.
4. The swapped values of `a` and `b` are printed to the console.

Mapped Algorithms:
-------------------
The swapping algorithm can be mapped to SystemC using the following code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that swaps two integers
SC_MODULE(IntSwap) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> a_out, b_out; // Output ports for the swapped values

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(IntSwap) {
        // Processes to perform swap
        SC_METHOD(apply_swap);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to apply the swap
    void apply_swap() {
        int temp = a.read();
        a_out.write(b.read());
        b_out.write(temp);
    }
};
```
The SystemC module `IntSwap` takes two input ports `a` and `b` and two output ports `a_out` and `b_out`. The input ports are initialised with the values of `a` and `b`, respectively, and the method `apply_swap` modifies the values of the inputs. The method also writes the swapped values to the output ports.

Testbench:
----------
The SystemC code can be integrated with the testbench provided above by using the input and output signals `sc_in<int> a`, `sc_in<int> b`, `sc_out<int> out_a`, and `sc_out<int> out_b`. The algorithm can be tested by providing arbitrary values for the input signals `a` and `b` and comparing the resulting swapped values to the output signals `out_a` and `out_b`.

Conclusion:
----------
The SystemC code generated by this analysis faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source code. The code is easy to understand and follows a well-structured format. The mapping of the logic to SystemC ensures that the code can be tested and simulated in a high-level synthesis flow.
