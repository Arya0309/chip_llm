  As the provided C++/C code is an implementation of the iterative binary search algorithm, the inputs and outputs of the code are as follows:

Inputs:

* The vector <v> containing the search space.
* The target element to be found.

Outputs:

* A boolean variable <found> indicating whether the target element is found in the vector.

A block-by-block/line-by-line explanation of the provided C++/C code is as follows:

1. First, the header file "bits/stdc++.h" is included, which provides the necessary definitions and declarations for the program.
2. The program uses the "std" namespace, which is an alias for "std::". This is used to provide access to various standard C++ libraries and utilities.
3. The "binarySearch()" function is defined which takes two input arguments - a vector<int> reference to the data to be searched and an integer target value to be found in the search space.
4. The function begins by defining the left and right boundaries of the search space and initializing the midpoint to the middle index of the vector.
5. The function enters a loop where it continues to divide the search space into smaller parts until the target element is found or the search space cannot be further divided.
   * The if-statement checks whether the middle element is equal to the target element.
   * If the middle element is equal to the target, the function returns "true" via the "return" statement, indicating that the target has been found.
6. If the middle element is greater than the target, the function jumps to the "else" branch of the "if-else" statement.
7. In this branch, the function updates the right boundary index to the previous midpoint and repeats the process of finding the middle element.
8. If the middle element is smaller than the target, the function updates the left boundary index to the next midpoint and repeats the process of finding the middle element.
9. If there are no further divisions of the search space, the function returns "false" via the "else" statement at the end of the loop, indicating that the target has not been found.
10. In the "main()" function, the vector <v> is initialized with sorted integers.
11. The target element is then defined as an integer variable <target>.
12. The <binarySearch()> function is then called with the initialized vector <v> and the target element.
13. The function returns a boolean variable <found> indicating whether the target element was found in the search space.
14. The program then prints the appropriate string out to indicate whether the target element was found or not.

**Generating Equivalent SystemC Code:**

The provided C++/C code is a perfect candidate for high-level synthesis, especially when coupled with the provided SystemC signals and port declarations.
To generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet, we need to replicate the functionality of the original C++/C code using SystemC programming constructs.

Here's one possible implementation:
```c
// Iterative Binary Search in SystemC

#include <systemc.h>

#include <vector>

using namespace sc_core;

SC_MODULE(binary_search) {
    // Declare the signals used by the module
    sc_in<vector<int>> vector_input;
    sc_in<int> target_input;
    sc_out<bool> found_output;

    // Declare the module's interface
    SC_HAS_PROCESS(binary_search);

    binary_search(sc_module_name name) : sc_module(name), vector_input("vector_input"), 
                                         target_input("target_input"), found_output("found_output") {
        // Create a process to perform the binary search
        SC_THREAD(search_process);
        sensitive << vector_input << target_input;
    }

    void search_process() {
        int low = 0, high = vector_input.size() - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (high - low) / 2 + low;
            
            // If the middle element is equal to the target, set
            // found_output to true and exit the loop
            if (vector_input[mid] == target_input) {
                found_output.write(true);
                break;
            }

            // If the middle element is greater than the target,
            // update the high boundary of the search space to the
            // previous midpoint and repeat the loop
            else if(vector_input[mid] > target_input) {
                high = mid - 1;
            }

            // If the middle element is smaller than the target,
            // update the low boundary of the search space to the
            // next midpoint and repeat the loop
            else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    sc_clock clk("clk", 10, SC_NS);
    sc_signal<bool> found_output;
    sc_signal<vector<int>> vector_input;
    sc_signal<int> target_input;

    // Create an instance of the binary_search module
    binary_search bs("bs");

    // Connect the found_output signal of the module to the found_signal
    // of the testbench
    bs.found_output(found_output);

    // Connect the vector_input signal of the module to the vector_input
    // of the testbench
    bs.vector_input(vector_input);

    // Connect the target_input signal of the module to the target_input
    // of the testbench
    bs.target_input(target_input);

    // Create a vector containing the input values
    vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};

    // Set the target value
    int target = 8;

    // Copy the vector values to the vector_input signal
    vector_input.write(v);

    // Set the target input
    target_input.write(target);

    // Wait for the search process to end
    wait(bs.found_output.pos());

    // Print the result
    if (found_output.read()) {
        cout << "Target found." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Target NOT found." << endl;
    }

    // Stop the simulation
    return 0;
}
```
In this implementation, the "binary_search" module is created, which uses the sc_in and sc_out constructs to declare the input/output signals used by the module. The module also declares a process to perform the binary search using the "sc_thread" construct.

In the main system, a testbench is created that drives the input signals using the "sc_clock" and "sc_signal" constructs. The testbench also creates an instance of the "binary_search" module and connects its output signal to a signal variable in the testbench.

The testbench then executes the binary search algorithm and waits for the result. The final output is then retrieved and printed.

By replicating the functionality of the original C++/C code in SystemC, we have obtained an equivalent implementation that can be used for high-level synthesis and FPGA/ASIC implementation.
