  The provided C++/C code is a program to find the trace and normal of a given matrix.

The input is a matrix of size n x n, and the output is the trace and normal of the matrix, respectively.

The code first declares a variable `MAX` to specify the size of the matrix. It then defines two functions: one to calculate the normal of a matrix and another to calculate the trace of a matrix.

The `findNormal` function calculates the normal of a matrix by summing the squared values of each element in the matrix. The `findTrace` function calculates the trace of a matrix by summing the values of each diagonal element.

The main function defines the input matrix and calls the `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions to calculate the trace and normal of the matrix.

To convert this C++/C code to SystemC, we need to create a SystemC module that performs the same operations as the C++/C code.

The following is the equivalent SystemC code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates the trace and normal of a matrix
SC_MODULE(Matrix) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE]; // Input port for the matrix
    sc_out<int> trace; // Output port for the trace
    sc_out<int> norm; // Output port for the normal

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Matrix) {
        // Process to calculate trace and normal
        SC_METHOD(calculate);
        sensitive << matrix;
    }

    // Method to calculate trace and normal
    void calculate() {
        int trace = 0;
        int norm = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                trace += matrix[i][j];
                norm += matrix[i][j] * matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        trace.write(trace);
        norm.write(sqrt(norm));
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have created a module named `Matrix` that takes in a `matrix` input `size` being `SIZE` and outputs the `trace` and `norm` using the `trace` output and `norm` output, respectively.

To calculate the trace and normal, we use the `calculate` method that takes `matrix` as an input `size` being `SIZE`. The method calculates the trace and normal using nested loops, and the final trace and normal values are written to the `trace` and `norm` outputs.

In the testbench, we can connect the `Matrix` module with the input `matrix` signal and read the `trace` and `norm` signals to obtain the trace and normal of the input matrix.
