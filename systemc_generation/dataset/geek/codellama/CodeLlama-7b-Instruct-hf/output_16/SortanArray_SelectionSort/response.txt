  The provided C++/C code implements the selection sort algorithm. The code requires two inputs:

1. An array of integers to be sorted.
2. The size of the array.

The function `selectionSort` sorts the input array in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm. The function has the following inputs and outputs:

* Inputs:
	+ `arr`: Pointer to the array of integers to be sorted.
	+ `n`: Size of the array to be sorted.
* Outputs:
	+ `arr`: Sorted array.

The function works by iterating through the array, finding the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array, and swapping that element with the first element of the unsorted part. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

The function `swap` is used to swap the elements of the array. It takes two arguments, `xp` and `yp`, which point to the elements to be swapped.

The function `printArray` is used to print the sorted array. It takes two arguments, `arr` and `size`, which are the array and its size, respectively.

The main function of the program is to test the `selectionSort` function by providing a sample array to be sorted and printing the sorted array.

In SystemC, we can implement the same logic using the following code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that implements the selection sort algorithm
SC_MODULE(SelectionSort) {
    sc_in<int>* arr; // Input port for the array to be sorted
    sc_in<int> n; // Input port for the size of the array
    sc_out<int>* sorted; // Output port for the sorted array

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SelectionSort) {
        // Process to sort the array
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << arr << n;
    }

    // Method to sort the array
    void sort() {
        int i, j, min_idx;

        // Iterate through the array until all elements are sorted
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array
            for (j = i; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) {
                    min_idx = j;
                }
            }
            // Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part
            swap(&arr[min_idx], &arr[i]);
        }
    }

    // Function to swap two elements of the array
    void swap(int* xp, int* yp) {
        int temp = *xp;
        *xp = *yp;
        *yp = temp;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we have an input port `arr` for the array to be sorted, an input port `n` for the size of the array, and an output port `sorted` for the sorted array. The module uses the `SC_METHOD` construct to define a process that implements the selection sort algorithm. The process is sensitive to both the input ports and is triggered by a change in either of them. The `sort` method implements the logic of the `selectionSort` function and swaps the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array with the first element of the unsorted part. The `swap` function provides a convenient way to swap two elements of the array. The `printArray` function is not needed in this case, as the sorted array can be printed directly from the output port `sorted`.
