  This is a simple C++/C program that multiplies two matrices together. The inputs are two arrays, ```mat1``` and ```mat2```, and the output is a new array, ```rslt```, which holds the result of the multiplication. The program checks that the number of columns in ```mat1``` is equal to the number of rows in ```mat2``` and if not, it exits the program. Otherwise, it performs the multiplication and prints out the result.

Outputs:

* ```C[SIZE_RESULT]``` is the output of the multiplication, which is a new array of size ```SIZE_RESULT```.

Inputs:

* ```A[SIZE_A]``` is the first input array, which is a matrix of size ```R1 x C1```.
* ```B[SIZE_B]``` is the second input array, which is a matrix of size ```R2 x C2```.

Major lines of code:

1. The first major line of code is the declaration of the ```mulMat``` function, which takes in two matrices and returns the result of their multiplication.
2. The next major line of code is the declaration of the ```mat1``` and ```mat2``` arrays.
3. The next major line of code is the declaration of the ```rslt``` array, which will contain the result of the multiplication.
4. The next major line of code is the loop that multiplies the matrices together.
5. The final major line of code is the printing of the result of the multiplication.

SystemC equivalent:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that multiplies two matrices
SC_MODULE(MatrixMultiply) {
    // Input ports for the two matrices
    sc_in<int> A[SIZE_A];
    sc_in<int> B[SIZE_B];

    // Output ports for the result of the multiplication
    sc_out<int> C[SIZE_RESULT];

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatrixMultiply) {
        // Process to perform matrix multiplication
        SC_METHOD(mulMat);
        sensitive << A << B;
    }

    // Method to multiply the matrices
    void mulMat() {
        int rslt[R1][C2];

        // Loop that multiplies the matrices together
        for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                rslt[i][j] = 0;

                for (int k = 0; k < R2; k++) {
                    rslt[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
                }
            }
        }

        // Print the result of the multiplication
        cout << "Multiplication of given two matrices is:\n";

        for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                cout << rslt[i][j] << "\t";
            }

            cout << endl;
        }
    }
};
```
The SystemC code is similar to the original C++/C code in terms of the loops and the multiplication operation. However, there are several key differences between the two codes. First, the SystemC code uses ```sc_in``` and ```sc_out``` ports to declare the input and output signals, rather than using global variables. Second, the SystemC code uses the ```sensitive``` keyword to specify that the ```mulMat``` method should only be executed when either the ```A``` or ```B``` signals change. This allows the method to be synthesized to a more efficient hardware design. Finally, the SystemC code includes a ```cout``` statement to print the result of the multiplication, which is not present in the original C++/C code. Overall, the SystemC code is more concise and efficient than the original C++/C code, and can be used in a synthesis flow to produce a hardware implementation of the matrix multiplication algorithm.
