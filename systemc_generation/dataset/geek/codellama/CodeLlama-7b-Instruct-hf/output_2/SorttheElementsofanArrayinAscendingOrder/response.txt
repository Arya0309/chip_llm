  First, the C++/C code is divided into several functions:

1. `main`: The program starts by defining an array `nums[]` and assigning it a sequence of integers. The size of the array is determined by the expression `sizeof(nums) / sizeof(nums[0])`. The function then prints the array elements before sort Art array in ascending order using the `sort()` function.
2. `sort()`: This is a bubble sort algorithm that sorts the array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the correct order. The `isSwapped` variable is used to keep track of whether any swaps have been made during the current iteration of the loop. If `isSwapped` is false after one iteration, it means that the array is already sorted and the function can terminate.
3. `swapNums()`: This function swaps two elements in the array by storing the value of the second element in a temporary variable and then assigning the value of the first element to the second element and vice versa.

The output of the `sort()` function is an array `nums[]` that is in ascending order.

In SystemC code, the inputs and outputs are defined as follows:
```scss
// Declare input and output ports
sc_in<bool> clk;
sc_in<bool> start;
sc_out<bool> done;

int nums[] = ...; // Declare array to store input values
int len = ...;    // Declare variable to store array length

// Process to perform sorting
SC_CTH(sort); // Enable sort process

// Output process
SC_METHOD( generating o.output stream ); // Declare output process
sensitive << nums; // Make output process sensitive to changes in nums
```
The sort process is enabled using the `SC_CTH(sort)` directive, and the output process is declared using the `SC_METHOD()` macro. The `sensitive` attribute is used to make the output process sensitive to changes in the `nums` array.
