  Input: An integer year (parameter year)
Output: A boolean value that indicates whether the year is a leap year (output of the checkYear function)

The provided code checks whether a given year is a leap year or not based on the following rules:
1. If a year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
2. If a year is not divisible by 400 but is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year.
3. If a year is not divisible by 100 but is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
4. Otherwise, it is not a leap year.

In natural language: The given year is a leap year if it divides by 400, if it does not divide by 100 but divides by 4, or if it does not divide by 400 and does not divide by 100. Otherwise, it is not a leap year.

\begin{code}
// Function to check leap year
bool checkYear(int year)
{
    if (year % 400 == 0) {
        return true;
    }
    // not a leap year if divisible by 100
    // but not divisible by 400
    else if (year % 100 == 0) {
        return false;
    }
    // leap year if not divisible by 100
    // but divisible by 4
    else if (year % 4 == 0) {
        return true;
    }
    // all other years are not leap years
    else {
        return false;
    }
}
\end{code}

\begin{code}
SC_MODULE(CheckLeapYear) {
sc_in<int> year;
sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;

SC_CTOR(CheckLeapYear) {
    // Process to check leap year
    SC_METHOD(checkLeapYear);
    sensitive<< year;
}

void checkLeapYear() {
    is_leap_year.write(checkYear(year.read()));
}
\end{code}
