  The provided C++/ C-style code converts an octal number to a decimal number, which is then displayed using SystemC inputs and outputs. 

The input is an octal number, which is read using an integer type called num. The code then converts the octal number to a decimal number using an integer type called dec_value.

The Friends-only library is utilized to increase octalToDecimal()'s functionality. This function isn't present in the conventional C++ standard library. An octal number is converted to a base 8 number, which then transforms it into a base 10 number using a modified recursive algorithm. @ To determine this base_value, the function repeatedly divides the octal number by 1 and multiplies the result by 8. This yields a factor that ensures no baser numbers exceed 10.

The converted decimal value is generated and returned by the function using dec_value. After this, the program simply prints out its argument octal value.This functional has an input port octal_input., a systemc_out port decimal_output, and a return type of int.

Finally, the code's output can be verified using the driver program, which simply passes the number 67 to the octal-to-decimal conversion. Other numerical inputs can be used to test the converter.
