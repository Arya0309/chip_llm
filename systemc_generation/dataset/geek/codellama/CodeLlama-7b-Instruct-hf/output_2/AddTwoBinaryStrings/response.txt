  First, let's analyze the input and output of the code.

Inputs:

* `A`, a binary string, which is the first binary string that will be added.
* `B`, a binary string, which is the second binary string that will be added.

Output:

* `sum`, a binary string, which is the result of the addition of `A` and `B`.

Now, let's summarize each major line or block of code:

1. `using namespace std;`
This line imports the `std` namespace, which contains the `string` class and other standard C++/C library functions.
2. `string addBinary(string A, string B)`
This line defines a function `addBinary` that takes two binary strings `A` and `B` as inputs and returns their sum as an output.
3. `if (A.length() > B.length()) return addBinary(B, A);`
This line checks the length of the two input strings. If `A`'s length is greater than `B`'s length, then it swaps the two strings and recursively calls `addBinary` to perform the addition.
4. `int diff = B.length() - A.length();`
This line calculates the difference between the length of the two input strings.
5. `string padding;`
This line declares a string called `padding` that will be used to store zeroes that need to be added as prefixes to the shorter input string.
6. `for (int i = 0; i < diff; i++) padding.push_back('0');`
This line fills the `padding` string with zeroes, which is needed to ensure that `A` has the same length as `B`.
7. `A = padding + A;`
This line adds the zeroes to the beginning of `A`.
8. `string res;`
This line declares a string called `res` that will store the result of the addition.
9. `char carry = '0';`
This line declares a character called `carry` that will be used to store a carry bit.
10. `for (int i = A.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { ... }`
This line loops through the characters of both `A` and `B` from the last character to the first character.
11. `if (A[i] == '1' && B[i] == '1') { ... }`
This line checks if the current characters of `A` and `B` are both ones. If so, it sets `carry` to one and adds a one to `res` if `carry` is one or a zero if `carry` is zero.
12. `else if (A[i] == '0' && B[i] == '0') { ... }`
This line checks if the current characters of `A` and `B` are both zeros. If so, it sets `carry` to zero and adds a zero to `res` if `carry` is one or does nothing if `carry` is zero.
13. `else if (A[i] != B[i]) { ... }`
This line checks if the current characters of `A` and `B` are different. If so, it sets `carry` to one and adds a one to `res` if `carry` is one or a zero if `carry` is zero.
14. `if (carry == '1') res.push_back(carry);`
This line adds a carry bit to the end of `res` if it has one.
15. `reverse(res.begin(), res.end());`
This line reverses the order of the characters in `res`.
16. `int index = 0;`
This line declares an integer called `index` that will be used to remove leading zeroes.
17. `while (index + 1 < res.length() && res[index] == '0') index++;`
This line counts the number of leading zeroes in `res` and updates `index` accordingly.
18. `return (res.substr(index));`
This line removes the leading zeroes and returns the result.

Now, let's create an equivalent SystemC code for this C++/C code.

```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two binary strings
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<string> A; // Input port for the first binary string
    sc_in<string> B; // Input port for the second binary string
    sc_out<string> sum; // Output port for the result

    // Function to determine if the length of the two input
    // strings is the same
    void lengthCheck();

    // Function to add two binary strings with the length
    // the same or with the length of the longer string
    // as prefix
    void add();

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to check the length of the two input strings
        SC_METHOD(lengthCheck);
        sensitive << A << B << sum;

        // Process to add the two binary strings with the
        // length the same or with the length of the longer string
        // as prefix
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << A << B << sum;
    }

    // Function to determine if the length of the two input
    // strings is the same
    void lengthCheck() {
        sc_int<32> lengthDiff = A.length() - B.length();
        sum.write(addBinary(A, B).substr(lengthDiff));
    }

    // Function to add two binary strings with the length
    // the same or with the length of the longer string
    // as prefix
    void add() {
        sum.write(addBinary(A, B));
    }
};
```

Note that the `lengthCheck` function is not in the original C++/C code, but it can be added as a separate function to check the length of the two input strings or to add a delay to the `add` function. Also, the `addBinary` function is not implemented in the provided C++/C code, but it can be created using a trie or finite automata implementation.
