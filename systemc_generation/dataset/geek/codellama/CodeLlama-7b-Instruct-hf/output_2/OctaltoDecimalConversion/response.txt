The C++/C code provided is a simple program that converts an octal number to its decimal equivalent. It reads an octal input from the user and displays the corresponding decimal output.

Input: The program takes an octal input from the user and stores it in the variable 'num'.

Output: The program displays the decimal equivalent of 'num' in the console.

Line-by-line explanation:

1. The first line includes the standard C++ library header file <iostream>.
2. The second line, using the 'using namespace std;' declaration, allows the programmer to use items from the standard library without explicitly specifying std::name.
3. The third line defines a function named octalToDecimal().
4. The fourth line within the function declares two variables, num and dec_value.
5. The fifth line sets a variable named base to the initial value of 1 to be used in the calculation.
6. The sixth line reads an input integer from the user and assigns it to the variable num.
7. The seventh line defines a temporary variable named temp that stores the input value num.
8. The eighth line contains a loop that runs while temp is non-zero.
9. The ninth line extracts the last digit of the input by taking the remainder of temp divided by 10 and assigns it to the variable last_digit.
10. The tenth line updates the temporary variable temp by dividing it by 10.
11. The eleventh line multiplies the extracted last_digit with the base value and adds it to the running total dec_value.
12. The twelfth line updates the base variable by multiplying it by 8.
13. The thirteenth line and the loop continues until the temporary variable temp is zero.
14. The fourteenth and final line of the function returns the final value of dec_value.
15. The last line of the code defines a main() function that serves as the program's driver.
16. The second line within the function initializes a user-input octal number.
17. The third line uses the octalToDecimal() function to convert the user-inputted octal number to decimal.
18. The fourth line outputs the resulting decimal number to the console.

SystemC Implementation:

The provided C++/C code can be easily modified to be used in a high-level SystemC flow. The following SystemC code implements the functionality of the C++/C program:
``` SystemC
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(OctalToDecimalConverter) {
  sc_in<int> octalInput;
  sc_out<int> decimalOutput;

  SC_CTOR(OctalToDecimalConverter) {}

  void concurrentDecoder() {
    sc_uint<32> num, base;
    num = octalInput;
    base = 1;

    // Initializing base value to 1, 
    // i.e 8^0
    while (temp >= 1) {
      // Extracting last digit of input
      sc_uint<32> last_digit = (num % 10);
      temp = (num / 10);

      // Multiplying last digit with 
      // appropriate base value and adding 
      // it to dec_value
      dec_value += last_digit * base;

      base = base * 8;
    }

    // Process output
    decimalOutput = dec_value;
  }
};
```
This SystemC module takes in the octal input via the sc_in port 'octalInput' and converts it to the decimal equivalent using the same algorithm as the original C++/C code. The output is then written to the sc_out port 'decimalOutput'. Ensure that the signals Octal_input and Decimal_output are connected in the SystemC testbench to preserve the original program's functionality.
