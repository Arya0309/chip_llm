  This program is an example of a rudimentary approach to complex number addition using a [Complex data structure](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19267739/how-to-use-complex-numbers-in-c) in C++ with two user-defined class Complex and a addComp method to add two complex numbers.

The code inputs are real1,  imag1,  real2,  and imag2 and outputs the sum real_sum and im_sum to integrate with SystemC.


```

// Defining addComp() method
	// for adding two complex numbers
	Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
	{
		ompla the body of the function here  }



```

Obviously, the concept of complex number addition is to add its

pi remainders and put them in the same format. Thirdly, to add the real numbers'  and imaginary number's remainders and put the result into the same format of real numbers' and imaginary numbers'.


```
class Complex 
{ 
	// Declaring variables
	public: int real, imaginary;

	// Constructor to accept
	// real and imaginary part
	Complex(int tempReal = 0, 
			int tempImaginary = 0)
	{
		real = tempReal;
		imaginary = tempImaginary;
	}
	 
	// Defining addComp() method
	// for adding two complex numbers
	Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
	{
		// Creating temporary variable
		Complex temp;

		// Adding real part of 
		// complex numbers
		temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;

		// Adding Imaginary part of 
		// complex numbers
		temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);

		// Returning the sum
		return temp;
	}


sc_in<int> real_1;  
sc_in<int> imag_1;  
sc_in<int> real_2;  
sc_in<int> imag_2;  
sc_out<int> real_sum;    
sc_out<int> imag_sum; 






```
