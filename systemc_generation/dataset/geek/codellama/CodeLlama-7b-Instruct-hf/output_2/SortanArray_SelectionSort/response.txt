  The given C++/C code implements a selection sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The code has the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:

* `arr`: an array of integers that needs to be sorted
* `n`: the number of elements in the `arr` array

Outputs:

* `sorted_arr`: the sorted array

The code is primarily composed of the following lines of code:

* `selectionSort()` function: This function takes an array and its size as input and sorts the array using the selection sort algorithm. The function repeatedly finds the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part.
* `swap()` function: This function takes two integer variables as input and swaps their values.
* `printArray()` function: This function prints an array of integers to the console.

The key blocks of the code are:

* `selectionSort()` function: This function iterates through the array from 0 to `n-1` and finds the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array each iteration. It then swaps the minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part.
* `swap()` function: This function swaps the values of two integer variables.
* `printArray()` function: This function prints the sorted array to the console.

To translate this code into SystemC, we can write a module that performs the same functionality. Here's an example SystemC code that implements the same logic:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that sorts an array of integers using the selection sort algorithm
SC_MODULE(SelectionSort) {
    // Input ports
    sc_in<int> arr;
    sc_in<int> n;

    // Output port
    sc_out<int> sorted_arr;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SelectionSort) {
        // Process to perform selection sort
        SC_METHOD(selection_sort);
        sensitive << arr << n;
    }

    // Selection sort algorithm
    void selection_sort() {
        int i, j, min_idx;

        // Iterate through the array from 0 to n-1
        for (i = 0; i < n.read() - 1; i++) {

            // Find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array
            min_idx = i;
            for (j = i + 1; j < n.read(); j++) {
                if (arr.read()[j] < arr.read()[min_idx]) {
                    min_idx = j;
                }
            }

            // Swap the minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part
            swap(arr.read()[min_idx], arr.read()[i]);
        }
    }

    // Swap function
    void swap(int x, int y) {
        int temp;
        temp = x;
        x = y;
        y = temp;
    }

    // Function to print the sorted array
    void print_array() {
        for (int i = 0; i < n.read(); i++) {
            cout << arr.read()[i] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we implement the same functionality as the C++/C code. We define the input and output ports, including the `arr` and `n` arrays, and the `sorted_arr` array. We also define the `selection_sort()` function and the `swap()` function. The `selection_sort()` function is sensitive to the `arr` and `n` inputs and performs the selection sort algorithm. The `swap()` function swaps the values of two integer variables. Finally, we define a `print_array()` function to print the sorted array to the console.

We incorporate the signals defined above in the SystemC code by using the `sc_in` and `sc_out` keywords to define the input and output ports. We also use the `sc_method` keyword to define the method for the `selection_sort()` function, which is sensitive to the `arr` and `n` inputs.
