  The input(s) of the code are the integer n, which determines the series of fibonacci numbers to be calculated and the output(s) of the code are the sum of the even-indexed fibonacci numbers up to n terms.
The code is a C++ function calculateEvenSum(int n) which calculates the sum of the even-indexed Fibonacci numbers less than n terms. The function uses a integer array fibo[] that stores the Fibonacci numbers.
The function calculates the sum of the even-indexed Fibonacci numbers in the array fibo[]. Since C++ has no concept of blocks, let alone Array methods. Hence the Algorithms have different syntax. Below is the SystemC version.
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to add the two numbers
    void add() {
        sum.write(a.read() + b.read());
    }
};
```
Once the sum of the even-indexed Fibonacci numbers in the array fibo[". The result is returned, and assigned to main()'s variable < sum >. Then in the main function the even-indexed Fibonacci sum from up to 8 terms. To do so, the program first declares a integer value of n with the address 8. Then finds the even-indiced sum of the 8 terms  by using CalculateevenSum(n)).
```
#Include <systemc.h>
int sc_main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
   int sum;
   int n = 8;
   plot << "Even indexed Fibonacci Sum upto n = 8 terms: " << endl;
   sum = CalculateevenSum(n);
   cout <<"Even indexed Fibonacci Sum upto n = 8: " << sum << endl;
}

```
