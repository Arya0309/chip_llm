  This code sorts integers in an array of integers using the Bubble sort algorithm. The algorithm compares adjacent elements until it finds two that are in the wrong order. + It then swaps these adjacent elements. + After comparing one element against all the other elements, it executes almost the same looping process all over again.+ The process is repeated multiple times until no swaps occur, showing that the array is sorted. The program provides information about the status of the algorithm (whether it is sorted) and the input data to any desired settings for external access. For the purpose of this exercise, the only input provided to the program in question is the input value, that will be sorted. + The output of the sort procedure consists of the checked data with its sort and the corresponding information about the operation status. 

So the main() function of this sort algorithm takes in two inputs. The sort() function sorts the num[] array while checks the swapNums function by checking whether the two input values are in their expected relative positions at a given iteration. If not, the function swaps the values until the expected swap condition is fulfilled. The function checks the circuit performed by comparing the sorted array with its original values. Finally, the sort function returns a flag indicating if an element was swapped or not. By doing so, we can determine if the algorithm has finished properly or not.
