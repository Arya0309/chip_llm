  The provided C++/C code calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of a square 2D array. The code takes in a 2D array of integers, 'mat', with dimensions 'n x n', and outputs the sum of the principal and secondary diagonals. The code uses two for loops to iterate over the elements of the array and check if the current element is on the principal or secondary diagonal. If the element is on the principal diagonal, its value is added to the 'principal' variable. If the element is on the secondary diagonal, its value is added to the 'secondary' variable. After the loops have finished, the values of the principal and secondary diagonals are printed to the console.

Here is a natural language explanation of the code:

* The code declares two variables, 'principal' and 'secondary', to hold the sum of the diagonal elements.
* For each row of the 2D array, it checks if the current element is on the principal or secondary diagonal using two separate loops.
* If the element is on the principal diagonal, its value is added to the 'principal' variable.
* If the element is on the secondary diagonal, its value is added to the 'secondary' variable.
* After both loops have finished, the values of the principal and secondary diagonals are printed to the console.

Here is an equivalent SystemC code that captures the same logic:
```c
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSum) {
    // Inputs
    sc_in<int> matrix[MAX][MAX]; // 2D array of integers
    sc_in<int> n; // Dimension of the array

    // Outputs
    sc_out<int> principal; // Sum of the principal diagonal
    sc_out<int> secondary; // Sum of the secondary diagonal

    void printDiagonalSums() {
        int principal = 0, secondary = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == j) {
                    principal += matrix[i][j];
                } else if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) {
                    secondary += matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        principal.write(principal);
        secondary.write(secondary);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the inputs, 'matrix' and 'n', are the same as those in the original C++/C code. The outputs, 'principal' and 'secondary', are the same as the variables declared in the original code. The 'printDiagonalSums' method has the same functionality as the original 'printDiagonalSums' function. The loops iterate over the elements of the 2D array, just like in the original code, and check if the elements are on the principal or secondary diagonal. If they are, their values are added to the appropriate variable. Finally, the values of the principal and secondary diagonals are written to the 'principal' and 'secondary' outputs.

Overall, this natural language explanation should capture the functionality of the original C++/C code, and the SystemC code provides a faithful translation of that functionality. The code can be used in a high-level synthesis flow, as it faithfully preserves the logic of the original code.
