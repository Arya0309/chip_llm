  ** inputs :**
You receive a matrix and a signed integer variable `n`.

**outputs:**
The program outputs the trace and the normal of the given matrix.

Here is a natural language summary of the code line by line:

First insert the library **stdc++** and declare the variable **mat** and **size** where size is a constant defined to **MAX** (100).

The function **findTrace** finds the trace of a square array of size **n** by reading each element of row **i** and column **i** and summing up the product of each element with a for-loop.

Similarly, the function **findNormal** finds the normal of a square array of size **n** by multiplying the entire arrays and adding up the square of each element before taking the square root of the sum.

In the code, there is a **main** function that takes the integers as inputs and calls **findTrace** and **findNormal**. The output of the function **main** is the trace and the normal of the matrix passed as argument.

Based on the provided code, we need to generate the equivalent SystemC code. Here is the natural language summary of the code line by line:

First include the file `<systemc.h>`.

Declare an input port name **matrix** and an output port named **trace** and **norm**.

The function **findTrace** takes an input port named **matrix** and an output port named **trace** and sums up each element of row **i** and column **i** and outputs the value of the sum in **trace**.

Similarly, the function **findNormal** takes an input port named **matrix** and an output port named **norm** and squares each element of the array before adding them up and returning the square root of the sum.

Then, the **main** function takes the integers **mat** and **n** as its inputs and calls **findTrace** and **findNormal**. The outputs of these functions are the **trace** and **norm** of the matrix provided. 

The code snippet that captures the same functionality of the provided code is given below.
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Input and output ports
sc_in<int> matrix[MAX];
sc_out<int> trace;
sc_out<int> norm;

SC_MODULE(trace_normal) {
// Function to find the trace of a square array of size n
void findTrace(sc_in<int> matrix, sc_in<int> n) {
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
sum += matrix[i][j];
}
}
trace = sum;
}

// Function to find the normal of a square array of size n
void findNormal(sc_in<int> matrix, sc_in<int> n) {
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
sum += matrix[i][j] * matrix[i][j];
}
}
norm = sqrt(sum);
}

int main() {
int mat[][MAX] = {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
{2, 2, 2, 2, 2},
{3, 3, 3, 3, 3},
{4, 4, 4, 4, 4},
{5, 5, 5, 5, 5}};
findTrace(mat[i][i], 5);
findNormal(mat[i][i], 5);
trace = trace.read();
norm = norm.read();
cout << "Trace of Matrix = "<< trace << endl;
cout << "Normal of Matrix = " << norm << endl;
return 0;
}
}
