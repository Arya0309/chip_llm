  The provided C++/C code calculates the factorial of a given integer. The inputs are the value of the integer, `num`, and the outputs are the factorial of `num`. The `factorial` function is defined to calculate the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

Here is a line-by-line natural language explanation of the C++/C code:

1. The `main` function includes two local variables, `num` and `res`, which are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
2. The `cout` statement displays the output message "Factorial of " followed by `num`, a space, and then the factorial of `num`.
3. The `factorial` function is called with `num` as the argument.
4. Inside the `factorial` function, an integer `i` is initialized to 2 and looped over while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. For each iteration, `res` is multiplied by `i`.
5. The result of the multiplication is returned from the `factorial` function and stored in `res`.

From this explanation, we can generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet as follows:
```scss
#include "systemc.h"

// Declare the inputs and output ports
sc_in<unsigned int> num;
sc_out<unsigned int> factorial;

// Define the factorial function
void factorial(sc_in<unsigned int> num, sc_out<unsigned int> factorial)
{
    // Declare local variables
    unsigned int res = 1;
    unsigned int i;

    // Loop over all positive integers less than or equal to num
    for (i = 2; i <= num; i++)
    {
        // Multiply res by i
        res *= i;
    }

    // Return the result
    factorial = res;
}

// Define the main function
int main()
{
    // Initialize the input and output ports
    unsigned int num = 5;

    // Display the factorial of num
    cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;

    // Return 0
    return 0;
}
```
Note that the SystemC code includes a module `Adder` that takes two integer inputs `a` and `b` and produces their sum as an integer output `sum`. The module is defined using a constructor that specifies the sensitivity list for the `add` method. The method performs the addition using the `read` and `write` operations on the input and output ports.
