  C++ Program to Implement Iterative Binary Search
=========================================================

The provided code consists of a C++ function called `binarySearch()` that takes an array of integers and a target value as input and returns whether the target value is present in the array or not. The function implemented a brute force iterative binary search algorithm.

Inputs
-----

The input to the `binarySearch()` function is an array of integers, `v`, and an integer value, `target`.

Outputs
-------

The output of the `binarySearch()` function is a boolean value indicating whether the target value, `target`, is present in the array, `v`.

Functionality
-------------

The `binarySearch()` function first defines the lower and upper bounds of the array, `low` and `high`, respectively, and sets them to `0` and `v.size() - 1`, respectively. It then enters a loop that repeatedly executes until the array cannot be divided into smaller parts or the target value is found.

Each iteration of the loop performs the following steps:

1. Calculates the middle index of the array, `mid`, by taking the arithmetic mean of the lower and upper bounds.
2. Compares the value at the middle index, `v[mid]`, to the target value.
3. If the middle index value is equal to the target value, the function returns `true`, indicating that the target value is present in the array.
4. If the middle index value is greater than the target value, the upper bound is updated to `mid - 1`.
5. If the middle index value is less than the target value, the lower bound is updated to `mid+1`.
6. If the target value is not found, the function returns `false`.

The main function in the code uses the `binarySearch()` function to search for a target value in an array of integers. The user encodes a vector of integers into an array, assigns a target value, and passes both to the `binarySearch()` function. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the target value was found in the array or not.

SystemC Implementation
--------------------

The code can be implemented in SystemC as follows:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that implements binary search
SC_MODULE(BinarySearch) {
  // Input vector
  sc_in<sc_vector<int>> v;
  
  // Target value
  sc_in<int> target;
      
  // Output flag
  sc_out<bool> found;
  
  // Constructor
  SC_CTOR(BinarySearch) {
    // Perform binary search
    SC_METHOD(search);
    sensitive << v << target;
  }
  
  void search() {
    // Define lower and upper bounds
    int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
      
    // Until we find the target value or the vector
    // cannot be divided into smaller parts
    while (low <= high) {
      // Calculate middle index
      int mid = (low + high) / 2;
      
      // Check if middle index contains target value
      if (v[mid] == target) {
        found.write(true);
        return;
      }
      
      // Update lower/upper bounds
      if (v[mid] > target) {
        high = mid - 1;
      } else {
        low = mid + 1;
      }
    }
    
    // Return false if target value is not found
    found.write(false);
 }
};
```
Note that the SystemC code utilizes the `v` and `target` signals as input and output ports, respectively, and returns a `found` signal indicating whether the target value is present in the array or not.
