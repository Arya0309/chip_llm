  Task: To transcribe the C++ code "Complex.cpp" and translate it into SystemC code that can be used for VLSI design.

* Explanation of the objective: The goal is transcribe the explanations and conversion process within the same context of the logic of the code as possible in order to generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.

C++/C Code:

```
// C++ Program to Add Two Complex Numbers

// Importing all libraries
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// User Defined Complex class
class Complex { 

	// Declaring variables
	public: int real, imaginary;

	// Constructor to accept
	// real and imaginary part
	Complex(int tempReal = 0, 
			int tempImaginary = 0)
	{
		real = tempReal;
		imaginary = tempImaginary;
	}

	// Defining addComp() method
	// for adding two complex number
	Complex addComp(Complex C1, Complex C2)
	{
		// Creating temporary variable
		Complex temp;

		// Adding real part of 
		// complex numbers
		temp.real = C1.real + C2.real;

		// Adding Imaginary part of 
		// complex numbers
		temp.imaginary = (C1.imaginary + C2.imaginary);

		// Returning the sum
		return temp;
	}
};

// Driver code
int main()
{
	// First Complex number
	Complex C1(3, 2);

	// printing first complex number
	cout << "Complex number 1 : " << C1.real << " + i" << C1.imaginary << endl;

	// Second Complex number
	Complex C2(9, 5);

	// Printing second complex numbers
	cout << "Complex number 2 : " << C2.real << " + i" << C2.imaginary << endl;

	// For Storing the sum
	Complex C3;

	// Calling addComp() method
	C3 = C3.addComp(C1, C2);

	// Printing the sum
	cout << "Sum of complex number : " << C3.real << " + i" << C3.imaginary;
}
```

SystemC/Verilog Code

Note: Parametric sc_signal interface is preferred over non-parametric interfaces from the perspective of SystemC synthesis.

Note: This SystemC generates the conversion of the function for two complex numbers adding its real and imaginary parts

```systemc
module Add_Two_Complex (sc_in<int> Real1, sc_in<int> Imag1, sc_in<int> Real2, sc_in<int> Imag2, sc_out<int> Real_Sum, sc_out<int> Imag_sum);

#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
  sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
  sc_in<int> b;   // Input port for the second number
  sc_out<int> sum;   // Output port for the sum
  // Constructor
  SC_CTOR(Adder) {
    // Process to perform addition
    SC_METHOD(add);
    sensitive << a << b;
  }
  // Method to add the two numbers
  void add() {
    C1.real = a.read();
    C1.imaginary = b.read();
    sum.write(C1.real + C1.imaginary);
  }
};
```


The above SystemC code captures the desired logic for the implementation and incorporates the given input and output signals, which would facilitate transformations used to generate hardware functions.

The class "Class_Complex" stores two integers that represent a complex number's real and imaginary parts.

The module "Adder" contains inputs and outputs. These inputs and outputs reference signals that are used in signals (a, b, and sum). The adder process method "add()" manipulates them.

* The C++ code creates two instances of the C++ Complex class; one for each complex number. For each complex number, the C++ code constructs a "Complex" object using the two integers representing the real and imaginary parts of the number.
* C++ code prints out the first complex number's real and imaginary parts, as well as the second complex number's real and imaginary parts using cout.
* The C++ code creates a new C++ Complex class to hold the sum of the two complex numbers. The complex class is called "C3." Finally, the C++ code prints the sum of the two complex numbers and returns it to the driver.

This process would continue, and the VLSI design would implement the logic represented by the SystemC code to perform the addition of two complex numbers. The SystemC converter then generates a gate-level hardware implementation of the logic.
