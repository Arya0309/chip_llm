  Inputs:

* `key` is a scalar integer input
* `data` is a vector of integer inputs

Outputs:

* `index` is a scalar integer output

Summary:

* The provided C++/C program implements a linear search algorithm iteratively.
* It takes an integer input `key` and a vector of integer inputs `data`.
* It searches for the presence of `key` in `data` and returns the index of the found element.
* If `key` is not found, it returns `-1`.

Equivalent SystemC code:

```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(linearSearch) {
    sc_in<int> key; // Input port for the key
    sc_in<int> data[K]; // Input ports for the vector of data
    sc_out<int> index; // Output port for the index of the found element

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(linearSearch) {
        // Process to perform the linear search
        SC_METHOD(search);
        sensitive << key << data;
    }

    // Method to perform the linear search
    void search() {
        // Iterate over the vector of data
        for (int i = 0; i < K; i++) {
            if (data[i].read() == key.read()) {
                index.write(i);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
};

```

Explanation:

The equivalent SystemC code implements the linear search algorithm iteratively, just like the C++/C code.

1. The `linearSearch` module is instantiated with input ports for `key` and `data`.
2. The `search` method is called whenever `key` or `data` changes.
3. The `search` method iterates over the `data` vector and compares each element with `key`. If a match is found, the index of the found element is written to the `index` output port and the method terminates. If no match is found, the method continues iterating over the next element in the `data` vector.
4. The `search` method can be sensitive to both `key` and `data` to ensure that the search is performed as soon as either input changes.

Note that the generated SystemC code has the same inputs and outputs as the original C++/C code, and it faithfully captures the logic of the search algorithm.
