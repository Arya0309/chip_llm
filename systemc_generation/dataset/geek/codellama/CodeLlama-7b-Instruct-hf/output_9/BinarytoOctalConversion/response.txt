  This code takes an octal number and returns an integer. 
The C++/C code checks if the inputs are in octal form (each digit in the number is less than 8) and converts them to their decimal representations. 
 This is then returned in an output. 

Here is a line-by-line natural language summary: 

*We will write a C++ program to convert an octal number to its decimal equivalent. 
*We have included several headers to support the function, including <iostream> and <cmath> for vector support, and <math.h> for mathematical routines.
*We define a variable called n, which is used to represent the number being converted.
*We start by declaring a variable called base, which is set to the power of 8. And then, Wehave a loop that stops when the number becomes 0; this loop converts the octal number into decimal. 
*The loop extracts the last digit from the number each time through the loop. The same method is used to determine the decimal equivalent.
*Out of this loop, the function returns the final value.
*The program begins running in the main function where the function is called with an octal number supplied by the user as an input. This line reads in an integer and displays the output for the user.

Let’s rewrite this program in SystemC to generalize the process. Here’s a method to generalize the process:

First, include the SystemC header file to support code synthesis.

Next, create a module that takes two Integers representing Octal numbers. 

The module declares an Output port to deliver the equivalent decimal entities while an Insider port valid signal to determine when the output port should be enabled. To enable the output, we create a method called Add that reverses the operations we did in the previous method and returns the final sum. In the While loop, we can calculate the decimal value of the entered octal number. To create the SystemC code, we can follow these steps:
