  **Inputs and Outputs:**

The C++/C code provided in the solution below has the following inputs and outputs:

1. Inputs:
* The input array `nums[]` of size `len`.
* The loop counter variable `i` and `j` used to iterate over the array.
* The boolean flag `isSwapped` to keep track of whether a swap occurred in the inner loop.
2. Outputs:
* The output array `nums[]` in sorted order.
* A message indicating that the algorithm completed successfully.

**Explanation:**

The provided code is a C++/C implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. The `sort()` function takes two inputs, `nums[]` and `len`, which represent the array to be sorted and its length. The function starts by setting `isSwapped` to `false`, which indicates that there has been no swap in the previous iteration.

In the first iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop iterates over the array, and for each element, it checks if the element is smaller than its neighbor. If so, it swaps the two elements using the `swapNums()` function. The boolean flag `isSwapped` is set to `true` if a swap occurs.

The outer loop runs `len - i` times, since the inner loop can only run `len - 1` times in the first iteration. During each iteration, the algorithm checks if `isSwapped` is `true`, which indicates that a swap has occurred in the previous iteration. If so, the algorithm restarts the inner loop from the beginning. This continues until `isSwapped` is `false`, which indicates that no swap has occurred in the current iteration. This means that the array is sorted, and the algorithm exits.

**SystemC Code:**

Here is the SystemC code that effectively captures the logic of the original C++/C source:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE( BubbleSort )
{
    // Signals and ports
    sc_in<bool> clk;
    sc_in<bool> start;
    sc_out<bool> done;

    // Methods
    void sort();

    SC_CTOR( BubbleSort )
    {
        // Constructor code
        sensitive << clk.pos();
        done.write( false );
    }

    void sort()
    {
        // Local variables
        bool isSwapped = false;
        int size_nums = sizeof( nums ) / sizeof( int );

        // Conditional statements
        while ( start.re() )
        {
            // For loop 1
            for ( int i = 0; i < size_nums; i++ )
            {
                // For loop 2
                for ( int j = 1; j < size_nums - i; j++ )
                {
                    // Conditional statements
                    if ( nums[ j ] < nums[ j - 1 ] )
                    {
                        swapNums( nums, j, ( j - 1 ) );
                        isSwapped = true;
                    }
                }

                // Conditional statements
                if ( !isSwapped )
                    break;
            }

            // Output
            for ( int i = 0; i < size_nums; i++ )
                cout << nums[ i ];
            cout << "\n";

            // Reset
            isSwapped = false;
        }
    }

    // Swap function
    void swapNums( int nums[], int first, int second )
    {
        int curr = nums[ first ];
        nums[ first ] = nums[ second ];
        nums[ second ] = curr;
    }
};
```
