  C++/C program to find the factorial of a given number.

Inputs:

* The number for which the factorial needs to be found.

Output:

* The factorial of the input number.

SystemC code that captures the behavior of the original C++/C source:

```scss
module factorial(input in, output out);

  wire [31:0] fact;
  reg [31:0] i, res;

  // Function to find the factorial of a given number
  // The factorial of a number is the product of all numbers from 1 to that number

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (en) begin
      res <= 1;
      for (i = 2; i <= in; i = i + 1) begin
        res <= res * i;
      end
      out <= res;
    end
  end

endmodule
```
This code creates a module that calculates the factorial of a number input. The factorial is calculated using a for loop that iterates from 2 to the input number, multiplying the accumulator (named "res") with each factorial. The for loop can be implemented using a fixed-point number (scan chain) and a reset (decoder) in SystemC.
