  The provided C++/C code is a binary-to-decimal converter that takes as input a binary number in binary representation (i.e., using only the numbers 0 and 1) and outputs the corresponding decimal representation. The conversion is performed by the `binaryToDecimal` function, which relies on the concept of a "base-2" system, where each digit represents a power of 2 (e.g., 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, etc.)  The `binaryToDecimal` function takes an integer input `n` and performs the following steps:

    1. Initializes a temporary variable `temp` to have the same value as `n`.
    2. Initializes a variable `dec_value` to have a starting value of 0.
    3. Initializes a variable `base` to have a starting value of 1 (i.e., the base for the system).
    4. Repeatedly takes the following steps until `temp` is 0:
        1. Divides `temp` by 10 to obtain the next digit in the binary representation of `n`.
        2. Computes the product of the result of the previous step with `base`, which corresponds to the power of 2 (e.g., 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, etc.) associated with the digit.
        3. Adds the product of the previous two steps to the `dec_value`.
        4. Multiplies the value of `base` by 2 to update it for the next iteration of the loop.
    5. Returns `dec_value`.

The `main` function takes an integer input `num` and calls the `binaryToDecimal` function to compute the corresponding decimal representation. The output of the `binaryToDecimal` function is then printed to the console using `cout`.

SystemC logic equivalent:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(SC_MODULE) {
    sc_in<int> binary_in; // input port for binary number
    sc_out<int> decimal_out; // output port for decimal representation

    // Method to convert binary to decimal
    void binary_to_decimal() {
        int num = binary_in.read();
        int dec_value = 0;

        // Initialize base value to 1, i.e. 2^0
        int base = 1;

        int temp = num;
        while (temp > 0) {
            int last_digit = temp % 10;
            temp = temp / 10;
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base = base * 2;
        }

        decimal_out.write(dec_value);
    }
};
```
Note that the SystemC code replicates the functionality of the C++/C code by converting the input binary number into a decimal representation, which is then output to the console using the `decimal_out` signal.
