  This C/C++ code checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. It inputs an integer representing a year (year) and returns a boolean (is_leap_year) indicating whether the year is a leap year.

The program first checks whether the input year is divisible by 400. By the rules of the Gregorian calendar, a year that is divisible by 400 is always a leap year. If the year is not divisible by 400, it then checks if it is divisible by 100. If it is not divisible, whether or not it is also divisible by 4, it is a leap year. Otherwise, it is not a leap year.

The C++ code provides a high-level synthesis flow by generating SystemC code. The SystemC code uses two signals, year, and is_leap_year, that the driver code can send data through to prevent interoperability with the existing test bench. If the input year is a leap year, the program prints "LEAP YEAR." If not, it prints "Not a Leap year." The SystemC-compatible code helps in generating synthetic circuits. An easy alternative to modeling and implementation of logic circuits. This code provides an outlook on how C and C++ code can be translated into SystemC for high-level synthesis.
