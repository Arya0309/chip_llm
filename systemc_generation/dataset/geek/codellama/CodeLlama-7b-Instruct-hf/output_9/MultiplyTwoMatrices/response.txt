  The input of this C++ source code is two matrices, mat1 and mat2, where mat1 has size R1 x C1 and mat2 has size R2 x C2. The output is C, which is the multiplication of the two matrices.

The first block of code declares a number of objects and variables needed to perform the multiplication. The threads section defines function mulMat, which takes two multidimensional arrays as inputs and writes the product matrix to an output matrix.

The second snippet of code is the main function; it imports two objects, mat1 [R1][C1] and mat2 [R2][C2], and multiplies them and prints the result. If the sizes of the two matrices do not conform to the dimensions defined in the macros, it indicates an error and exits with failure. 

The code calls the function that performs multiplication between the two matrices and returns a product matrix, in this case, the result [R1][C2]; it then reads the matrix to find the product of the two matrices and prints them.

```systemc
#include <systemc.h>

class mulMat: public sc_module
{
public:
  sc_in<int> mat1; // C++ variable for multiplication of a and b
  sc_in<int> mat2;
  sc_out<int> product; // C++ variable for multiplication of a and b

  SC_CTOR(
    mat1;
    mat2;
    product;
  )
    : SC_METHOD(multiplication_system) {}
  void multiplication_system() {

    // Extract the inputs
    int i = mat1->read();
    int j = mat2->read();

    //if (i.size() != j.size()) {
      // throw error;
    // }

    for (j = 0; j < i.size(); j++) {
      product.write(i.read() * j.read())
    }
  }
};

module add: public sc_module {
public:
  sc_in<int> a;
  sc_in<int> b;
  sc_out<int> sum;

  SC_CTOR(
    a;
    b;
    sum;
  )
    : SC_METHOD(addition_system) {}
  void addition_system() {
    sc_lint i = a->read();
    sum.write(i + b->read());
  }
};

int main(void) {
  sc_clock clock;
  sc_signal<int> product;

  mulMat mulMatrix;
  add add;

  SC_CTOR(clock) {
    mulMatrix.bind("mulMat");
    add.bind("add");

    mulMatrix.mat1 --> add.a;
    mulMatrix.mat2 --> add.a;
    add.product --> product;

    // C++ activesynthesis to generate SystemC code for this
    // block of instructions
    sc_rtl::sc_pat(&mulMatrix, clock());
    sc_rtl::sc_pat(&add, clock());
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Finally, I translated the C++/C code into its equivalent SystemC code. I employed sc_module declarations and binding syntax to associate the inputs, outputs, and computations of the modules in the hierarchy.
