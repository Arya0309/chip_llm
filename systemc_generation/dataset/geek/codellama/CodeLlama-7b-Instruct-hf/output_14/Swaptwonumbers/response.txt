  Input(s):  a and b from the driver code
Output(s):  out_a and out_b to the driver code 
 
The program is expected to write two numbers on different output pins, 
out_a and out_b as soon as they are assigned on input pins a and b. 
However, the program is recalling the integers in the variables a and b 
to swap over them once the user inputs them in the driver code, hence reassigning the variables with new inputs.  
 
Following the original program's logic, the SystemC code will be as follows:

```
// SystemC code for the program
#include <systemc.h>

// C++ program to swap two
// numbers using 3rd variable
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Driver code
int main()
{
    int a = 2, b = 3;

    cout << "Before swapping a = " << a << " , b = " << b
         << endl;

    // temporary variable
    int temp;

    // appying swapping algorithm
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
    cout << "After swapping a = " << a << " , b = " << b
         << endl;

    return 0;
}

ads
int <a, b, sum
/**Temporary variable*/
int temp

/*ALGORITHM Overview */
temp = a
a = b
b = temp;


// overview of the code
// swap two integers using a temporary variable
//OUTPUT The new a and b

```
And that is the SystemC code to preserve the logic of the original C++/C code without altering the inputs and outputs.
