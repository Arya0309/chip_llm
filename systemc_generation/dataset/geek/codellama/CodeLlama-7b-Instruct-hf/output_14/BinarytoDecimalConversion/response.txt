  The provided C++/C code is a simple program that converts a binary number to its decimal equivalent. The program uses the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:

* `n`: The binary number to be converted.

Outputs:

* `dec_value`: The decimal equivalent of the binary number `n`.

The major lines of the code are:

1. The `binaryToDecimal` function, which takes an integer `n` as input and returns its decimal equivalent as output. The function uses a series of expressions to convert the binary number to its decimal equivalent.
2. The `binaryToDecimal` function is called from the `main` function, which takes no input and simply prints the output of `binaryToDecimal` to the console.

Based on this analysis, here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module for converting binary to decimal
SC_MODULE(BinaryToDecimal)
{
    // Input port for the binary number
    sc_in<int> binary_in;

    // Output port for the decimal equivalent
    sc_out<int> decimal_out;

    SC_CTOR(BinaryToDecimal)
    {
        // Converter process
        SC_METHOD(convert_binary_to_decimal);
        sensitive << binary_in;
    }

    void convert_binary_to_decimal()
    {
        int bin_num = binary_in.read();
        int dec_value = 0;
        int base = 1;
        int temp = bin_num;
        while (temp)
        {
            int last_digit = temp % 10;
            temp = temp / 10;
            dec_value += last_digit * base;
            base *= 2;
        }
        decimal_out.write(dec_value);
    }
};
```
Note that this SystemC code includes the same input and output ports as the original C++/C code, and also uses the same process to convert the binary number to its decimal equivalent. To integrate this SystemC code with the existing testbench, the `binary_in` and `decimal_out` signals from the testbench can be connected to the `binary_in` and `decimal_out` ports of this SystemC code, respectively.
