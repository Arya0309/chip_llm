  Based on the provided C++/C code, we can observe the following:

Input(s):

* `int n`

Output(s):

* `cout`

Each major line or block of code and its functionality:

1. `include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This line includes various standard and custom libraries in C++.

2. `using namespace std;`: This line imports various standard C++ namespaces, including `std::cout` and `std::cin`, into the global namespace.

3. `int main()`: This line starts the `main()` function, which is used to define the program's entry point.

4. `int n = 11;`: This line defines a variable `n` with an initial value of 11.

5. `if (n % 2 == 0)`: This line checks if the value of `n` is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator.

6. `cout << "Even"`: This line prints the string "Even" to the console if the value of `n` is divisible by 2.

7. `else`: This line marks the beginning of the else-statement.

8. `cout << "Odd"`: This line prints the string "Odd" to the console if the value of `n` is not divisible by 2.

9. `return 0;` This line returns an integer 0 to the `main()` function.

Using the SystemC programming language, we can replicate the above logic with the following code:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(CPlusPlusToSystemC) {
  sc_in<int> n_in;
  sc_out<int> result_out;

  // Constructor
  SC_CTOR(CPlusPlusToSystemC) {
    SC_CTHREAD(check_number, n_in.pos());
  }

  void check_number() {
    int n = n_in.read();
    if (n % 2 == 0) {
      result_out.write("Even");
    } else {
      result_out.write("Odd");
    }
  }
};
```
Note that the `CPlusPlusToSystemC` module reads an integer signal `n_in` as its input and writes a string signal `result_out` as its output. The `check_number` method performs the same checks as the original C++/C code, but using SystemC constructs instead of C++. The `sc_in.pos()` and `sc_out.write()` functions are used to read and write signals, respectively.
