  Task 1: Identify the Inputs and Outputs of the Code
The C++/C code given as input has the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:

1. Matrix m[][4] - a 2D matrix for sorting.
2. row r - the number of rows in the matrix.
3. col c - the number of columns in the matrix.

Outputs:

1. sorted matrix - the sorted 2D matrix.

Task 2: Summarize the Code
The code uses the "std::sort" algorithm to sort the rows of the matrix in place. The sorted matrix is stored in the same variable as the original matrix, m[]. After sorting, the matrix is printed.

The code first declares a swap function for swapping two elements in the matrix. The sortRowWise function is then defined, which takes the matrix, the number of rows, and the number of columns as inputs. The function performs the sorting of the rows in the matrix by iterating through each row and column. For each element in the row, the function iterates through the rest of the elements in the row and checks for larger elements. If an element is larger than the next element, the function swaps the two elements using the swap function. Finally, the function prints the sorted matrix.

The code is then defined as a main function, which driver code uses for testing. The driver code takes five parameters: the matrix, the number of rows, the number of columns, and the number of elements in the matrix. The driver code calls sortRowWise function to sort the matrix and then prints the sorted matrix.

Task 3: Generate SystemC Code
To generate SystemC code that captures the same behavior as the original C++/C source, we can use the following template:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module for sorting a 2D matrix row-wise
SC_MODULE(SortMatrix) {
    // Declare the signals that the module will use
    sc_in<bool> clk;
    sc_in<bool> start;
    sc_out<bool> done;

    // Declare the ports for the matrix
    sc_in<int> matrix[4];
    sc_out<int> sorted_matrix[4];

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SortMatrix) {
        // Set up the sensitivity list for the sort method
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << clk.pos();
        reset_signals_ascending();

        // Set up the sensitivity list for the print method
        SC_METHOD(print);
        sensitive << clk.pos();
    }

    // Method for sorting the matrix
    void sort() {
        // Sort the matrix using the "std::sort" algorithm
        // ...
        // ...
    }

    // Method for printing the sorted matrix
    void print() {
        // Print the sorted matrix
        // ...
        // ...
    }
};
```
The SortMatrix module has inputs for the clock signal (clk), the start signal (start), and the done signal (done), as well as outputs for the sorted matrix (sorted_matrix) and the matrix (matrix). The module is defined as an SC_MODULE that takes the clock signal as input and outputs a done signal once the sorting is complete.

The sort method is defined as a sensitive method that is triggered by the clock signal, but before the reset_signals_ascending method is used to sort the matrix, which initializes the sorting mechanism. After the reset_signals_ascending method is used, the sort method is triggered to sort the matrix using the "std::sort" algorithm.

The print method is also defined as a sensitive method that is triggered by the clock signal. The print method prints the sorted matrix.

Finally, the main source code is defined as a driver for the SortMatrix module, which takes the matrix, the number of rows, and the number of columns as inputs, and starts the sorting process. Once the sorting is complete, the main code prints the sorted matrix.

The complete code is as follows:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module for sorting a 2D matrix row-wise
SC_MODULE(SortMatrix) {
    // Declare the signals that the module will use
    sc_in<bool> clk;
    sc_in<bool> start;
    sc_out<bool> done;

    // Declare the ports for the matrix
    sc_in<int> matrix[4];
    sc_out<int> sorted_matrix[4];

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SortMatrix) {
        // Set up the sensitivity list for the sort method
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << clk.pos();
        reset_signals_ascending();

        // Set up the sensitivity list for the print method
        SC_METHOD(print);
        sensitive << clk.pos();
    }

    // Method for sorting the matrix
    void sort() {
        // Sort the matrix using the "std::sort" algorithm
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            // Iterate over each row
            for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                // Iterate over each element in the row
                for (int k = 0; k < c - j - 1; k++) {
                    // Iterate over the rest of the elements in the row
                    if (matrix[i][k] > matrix[i][k + 1]) {
                        // Swap the elements if necessary
                        swap(matrix[i][k], matrix[i][k + 1]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Method for printing the sorted matrix
    void print() {
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                // Print the sorted matrix
                printf("%d ", sorted_matrix[i][j]);
            }
            printf("\n");
        }
    }
};

// Driver code
int main() {
    SortMatrix sort_matrix();
    int matrix[4] = {{9, 8, 7, 1},
                    {7, 3, 0, 2},
                    {9, 5, 3, 2},
                    {6, 3, 1, 2}};
    int r = 4;
    int c = 4;
    int n = r * c;
    sort_matrix.start = tb.MakeInput();
    sort_matrix.clk = tb.MakeInput();
    sort_matrix.done = tb.MakeOutput();
    sort_matrix.matrix = tb.MakeInput();
    sort_matrix.sorted_matrix = tb.MakeOutput();
    tb.DriveInput(sort_matrix.start, 0);
    tb.DriveInput(sort_matrix.clk, 0);
    tb.DriveInput(sort_matrix.matrix, matrix, n * sizeof(int));
    tb.WatchOutput(sort_matrix.sorted_matrix, n * sizeof(int));
    tb.Run();
    return 0;
}
```
