  Task: Convert the provided C++/C code to SystemC code

Inputs:

* A C++/C program that includes a function for sorting an array in ascending order using bubble sort
* The function takes two inputs: an array of integers and the length of the array
* The function has no outputs

Outputs:

* A SystemC model that performs the same operation as the C++/C function
* The SystemC model takes the same inputs (array of integers and length of the array)
* The SystemC model has no outputs

Explanation:

The C++/C code provided is a brute-force approach to sorting an array in ascending order using bubble sort. The code consists of two main functions: `sort` and `swapNums`. The `sort` function takes two inputs: an array of integers and the length of the array. The `sort` function performs the bubble sort operation on the array by iterating over the array, swapping each element with the next element if the element is smaller than the next element. The `swapNums` function takes two inputs: an array of integers and the indices of the two elements to be swapped. The function swaps the elements at the specified indices in the array.

The importance of this task is that it involves converting a sequential C++/C program to a parallel SystemC model. The SystemC model must faithfully capture the logic of the C++/C program, including the inputs and outputs. The explanation must provide a clear, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language explanation of the code, highlighting the inputs and outputs, as well as the functionality of each major line or block of code.

SystemC Code:
```scss
// Defines the inputs and outputs of the module
input<int> num;
input<int> len;
output<int> sorted_nums;

// Implements the sorting algorithm
void isSorted();
void swap_elements(int nums[], int first, int second);

// Constructor
SC_CTOR( sorting_module ) {
    SC_METHOD( isSorted );
    sensitive << num << len;
}

// Sorting algorithm
void isSorted() {
    for( int i = 0; i < len; i++ ) {
        bool isSwapped = false;
        for( int j = 1; j < len - i; j++ ) {
            if( nums[j] < nums[j - 1] ) {
                swap_elements( nums, j, (j - 1) );
                isSwapped = true;
            }
        }
        if ( !isSwapped ) {
            break;
        }
    }
}

// Swaps two elements in the array
void swap_elements( int nums[], int first, int second ) {
    int curr = nums[first];
    nums[first] = nums[second];
    nums[second] = curr;
}
```
In the SystemC code, we define the inputs and outputs of the module. We then define the `isSorted` function, which performs the bubble sort operation on the array. The `swap_elements` function swaps two elements in the array.

Notice that the SystemC code assumes that the array of integers is passed as a single input `num`. The length of the array is also assumed to be passed as a separate input `len`. The system outputs the sorted array as a single output `sorted_nums`.

The SystemC model includes two main modules: `isSorted` and `swap_elements`. The `isSorted` module performs the bubble sort operation on the array, while the `swap_elements` module swaps two elements in the array.

In the constructor of the `sorting_module`, we define the method `isSorted` as a sensitive method, which will be called whenever the input `num` or the length parameter `len` changes. We also define the method `swap_elements` as a sensitive method, which will be called whenever the input `num` or `len` changes.

These blocks of code now provide a detailed overview of the functionality of the SystemC code and how it should be implemented to preserve the same functionality as the C++/C code.
