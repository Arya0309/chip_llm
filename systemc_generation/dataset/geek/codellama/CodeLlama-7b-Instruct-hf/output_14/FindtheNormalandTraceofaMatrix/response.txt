  This is a C++/C code that calculates the trace and determinant of a given square matrix.

Input: Matrix x of size n x n
Output: trace of x, normal of x

Line-by-line summary:

* Lines 1-7 : Import the required libraries
* Lines 8-10: Declarations of variables needed throughout the code
* Line 12: The size of the matrix is defined as MAX = 100
* Line 14-80: Functions to calculate the trace and determinant of a matrix of size n x n
* Line 79: The function (findTrace) calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix and returns it
* Line 85: The function (findNormal) calculates the square root of the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix squared and returns it
* Line 92: The main function initializes the matrix mat with some random values
* Initializes two variables:
* Line 95: trace is equal to the value returned by calling findTrace
* Line 96: norm is equal to the value returned by calling findNormal
* Line 99: calls function main (Calls findNormal, findTrace)
* Line 101: prints out the trace and determinant

The near-collaborative structure Infinity implies that each party maintains its own copy of the data at any given point in time. Much like how the MFA could use different copies of the systemC code in each party to improve their processes and expand enormously, each party maintains its unique copy of the data, facilitating high-level interoperation and collaboration.
