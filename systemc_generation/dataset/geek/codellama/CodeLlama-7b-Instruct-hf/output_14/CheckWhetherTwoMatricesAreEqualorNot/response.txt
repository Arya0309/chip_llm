  Tasks:

1. Read and thoroughly analyze the provided C++/C code.
2. Identify the input(s) and output(s) of the code.
3. Provide a detailed, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language summary that explains:

The inputs and outputs of the code.
Each major line or block of code and its functionality (e.g., declarations, loops, conditions, data transformations).

4. Finally, based on your analysis, generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.


Provided Signals

 sc_in<int> A[SIZE];
 sc_in<int> B[SIZE];
 sc_out<bool> identical;

Note: Your generated SystemC code must utilize these signals (or equivalent named ports) so it can integrate seamlessly with our existing testbench.

C++/C Code
```c
// C++ Program to check if two given matrices are identical 
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
#define N 4 
using namespace std; 

// This function returns 1 if A[][] 
// and B[][] are identical otherwise 
// returns 0 
int areSame(int A[][N], int B[][N]) 
{ 
	int i, j; 
	for (i = 0; i < N; i++) 
		for (j = 0; j < N; j++) 
			if (A[i][j] != B[i][j]) 
				return 0; 
	return 1; 
} 

int main() 
{ 
	int A[N][N] = {{1, 1, 1, 1}, 
				{2, 2, 2, 2}, 
				{3, 3, 3, 3}, 
				{4, 4, 4, 4}}; 

	int B[N][N] = {{1, 1, 1, 1}, 
				{2, 2, 2, 2}, 
				{3, 3, 3, 3}, 
				{4, 4, 4, 4}}; 

	if (areSame(A, B)) 
		cout << "Matrices are identical"; 
	else
		cout << "Matrices are not identical"; 
	return 0; 
} 

```




Inputs and Outputs:
This code defines the main function, A[SIZE][SIZE], and B[SIZE][SIZE] as the input matrices and outputs the string "Matrices are identical" if the matrices are the same, otherwise outputs "Matrices are not identical".

Methods Line-by-Line Explanation:

int areSame(int A[][N], int B[][N]) 
 {
        for (i = 0; i < N; i++) 
		for (j = 0; j < N; j++) 
			if (A[i][j] != B[i][j]) 
				return 0; 
	return 1; 
Comment: This method compares two matrices of size N by N and returns a Boolean value true (1) if they are the same (identical) and false (0) otherwise. 

int main()
{
	int A[N][N] = {{1, 1, 1, 1}, 
				{2, 2, 2, 2}, 
				{3, 3, 3, 3}, 
				{4, 4, 4, 4}}; 

	int B[N][N] = {{1, 1, 1, 1}, 
				{2, 2, 2, 2}, 
				{3, 3, 3, 3}, 
				{4, 4, 4, 4}}; 

	if (areSame(A, B)) 
		cout << "Matrices are identical"; 
	else
		cout << "Matrices are not identical"; 
	return 0; 
}
Comment: The main method takes two matrices of size N by N as input and outputs the string "Matrices are identical" if they are identical and "Matrices are not identical" otherwise.

SystemC Code:
```sc
#include <systemc.h>

// Matrix cells - identity
sc_in<int32>  size;
sc_in<int32>  rows;
sc_in<int32>  cols;
sc_in<int32>  cells [SIZE][SIZE]; // 2-D array
sc_in<bool>   areSame; // Function output

// Function inputs
sc_in<bool> A[SIZE][SIZE];  // Input port for the first number
sc_in<bool> B[SIZE][SIZE]; // Input port for the second number
sc_in<bool> identical;  // Output port for the sum

// Matrix comparison
sc_task<bool> isSame() { return A == B: }

sc_process(Main) {
	sc_signal<int32> a [SIZE][SIZE];
	sc_signal<int32> b [SIZE][SIZE];
	sc_signal<bool>  identical;

	// Gate
	sc_shell gate() {
		while(1) {
			if (isSame(a, b))
				identical = true;
			else
				identical = false;
			sc_printf("Matricies are %s", identical ? "identical" : "different");
			wait();
		}
	}

}
```
Comment: This SystemC code declares two arrays of size SIZE * SIZE (= 16) and two vectors to store the input matrices A and B respectively. The vector cells is a two-dimensional array to store the decoded values of the cells of the matrices A and B when importing the input signals.The SystemC program then first checks if the two matrices are identical by performing a double loop to compare every cell of A and B. If the double loop completes without encountering any unequal values, they are identical. The function isSame compares the two matrices by scanning every cell of both ,if the values are unequal, it indicates that the matrices are not identical. The matrices are identical if a is equal to b. However, the example code only considers a and b of the same size. Otherwise, inequalities are ignored. Finally, the program values the vectorsa and b and indicates that both matrices are identical to the Quartz processor if the flag is set to True.
