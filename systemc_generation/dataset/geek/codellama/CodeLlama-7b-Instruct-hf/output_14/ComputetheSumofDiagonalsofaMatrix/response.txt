  Input:

* The provided C++/C code is a simple program to find the sum of the diagonals of a square matrix. The code takes in a square matrix `mat` of size `N x N` and two variables `principal` and `secondary` to store the values of the principal and secondary diagonals respectively. The program also takes in a variable `n` that denotes the size of the matrix.

Outputs:

* The program outputs the values of the principal and secondary diagonals.

Summary:

* The program first initializes the `principal` and `secondary` variables to 0.
* It then enters a nested for loop that iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix.
* Inside the loop, the program checks the current row index `i` and column index `j` to see if they are equal. If they are equal, it adds the element at the diagonal `mat[i][j]` to the `principal` variable.
* The program then checks if the sum of the current row index and column index `i + j` is equal to the size of the matrix `n - 1`. If it is, it adds the element at the diagonal `mat[i][j]` to the `secondary` variable.
* After the nested loop, the program prints the values of the `principal` and `secondary` variables.

    secondary = 0;

    // Loop over the rows and columns of the matrix

    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            // Check if the current row and column are equal
            if (i == j)
            {
                // Add the element at the diagonal to the principal variable
                principal += mat[i][j];
            }
            else if ((i + j) == (n - 1))
            {
                // Add the element at the diagonal to the secondary variable
                secondary += mat[i][j];
            }
        }
    }
}

// Connect the input and output signals
sc_connect(mat, find_diagonals.mat);
sc_connect(n, find_diagonals.n);
sc_connect(principal, find_diagonals.principal);
sc_connect(secondary, find_diagonals.secondary);
```

In this SystemC code, we first define the input and output signals as the `mat` matrix of size `SIZE x SIZE` and two variables `principal` and `secondary` to store the values of the principal and secondary diagonals respectively. We then define a process `find_diagonals` to find the principal and secondary diagonals.

Inside the process, we first initialize the `principal` and `secondary` variables to 0. We then enter a nested for loop that iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix. Inside the loop, we check the current row index `i` and column index `j` to see if they are equal. If they are equal, we add the element at the diagonal `mat[i][j]` to the `principal` variable.

We then check if the sum of the current row index and column index `i + j` is equal to the size of the matrix `n - 1`. If it is, we add the element at the diagonal `mat[i][j]` to the `secondary` variable.

After the nested loop, we print the values of the `principal` and `secondary` variables.

Finally, we connect the input and output signals to the appropriate ports of the process.
