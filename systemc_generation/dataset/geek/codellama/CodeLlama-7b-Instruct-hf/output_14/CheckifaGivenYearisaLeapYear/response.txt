  **Inputs and Outputs of the Code**:

The provided C++/C code calculates whether a given year is a leap year or not. The code takes an integer year as input, and the output is a boolean value indicating whether the year is a leap year or not. In this summary, we will refer to the input as `year` and the output as `is_leap_year`.

**Summary of the Code**:

The code presents a function `checkYear`, which takes an integer parameter `year` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the year is a leap year or not. The function is defined in three cases, depending on the divisibility of `year` by 400, 100, or 4.

The first case is when `year % 400 == 0`, which means that `year` is both divisible by 4 and 100, making it a leap year. The second case is when `year % 100 != 0` and `year % 400 != 0`, which means that `year` is not divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400, so it is not a leap year. The third case is when `year % 4 == 0` and `year % 100 != 0`, which means that `year` is divisible by 4 but not by 100, so it is a leap year.

The driver code includes an example `main` function that calls the `checkYear` function with a given year, prints out the result, and returns 0.

**Equivalent SystemC Code**:

To generate an equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source, we can use the following code snippet:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// A module that checks if a given year is a leap year or not
SC_MODULE(LeapYearModule) {
    // Input and output ports
    sc_in<int> year;
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LeapYearModule) {
        // Process to determine if year is a leap year
        SC_METHOD(checkYear);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    // The checkYear method
    void checkYear() {
        if (year % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year = 1;
        } else if (year % 100 != 0 && year % 400 != 0) {
            is_leap_year = 0;
        } else if (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) {
            is_leap_year = 1;
        } else {
            is_leap_year = 0;
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `year` input is used as a driving input, and the `is_leap_year` output is used to reflect the result of the leap year calculation. The `checkYear` method contains the same logic as the C++/C code, with each case evaluated and the output updated accordingly.

Note that the `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals are used in this code to ensure seamless integration with the provided testbench. Our assumption is that a testbench is already available to test the SystemC code, and we should not need to modify it to accommodate the new SystemC code. We can use the testbench to simulate the SystemC code and check its output against the desired result.
