  This is a simple C++ code that interchanges the elements of the first row and the last row of a given 2D array. The resulting array is then displayed.

**Inputs:**

* A 2D integer array of size `$n \times n$`. The array is initialized with some values. The first row and the last row are referred to in the code below.

**Outputs:**

* The original array with the elements of the first row and the last row interchanged.

**Summary:**

The code starts by defining a 2D array of size `$n \times n$`. The array is initialized with some values. A function `interchangeFirstLast()` is defined to interchange the elements of the first row and the last row.

The `interchangeFirstLast()` function starts by initializing a variable `rows` to `$n`. This variable is then used to get the length of the row. The loop then begins to swap the elements of the first row and the last row.

The loop starts by declaring a variable `t` and assigning it the value at the current position of the first row, then it assigns the value at the current position of the last row to `t`, and lastly, it assigns the value in `t` back to the current position of the first row. This process is repeated `n` times to interchange all elements of the first row and last row.

The final step is to print the interchanged array. This is done by iterating through the array and printing each element on a new line.

**SystemC Equivalent:**

The following SystemC code preserves the logic of the original C++/C code while incorporating the signals defined above:
```c
// C++ code to swap the element of first 
// and last row and display the result
#include <systemc>
using namespace sc_core;
using namespace sc_dt;

#define n 4

void interchangeFirstLast(int m[n][n]) {
	int rows = n;

	// Swapping of element between first 
	// and last rows
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int t = m[0][i];
		m[0][i] = m[rows - 1][i];
		m[rows - 1][i] = t;
	}
}

// Driver code
int main() {
	// input in the array
	int m[n][n] = {{8, 9, 7, 6},
				{4, 7, 6, 5},
				{3, 2, 1, 8},
				{9, 9, 7, 7}};

	interchangeFirstLast(m);

	// Printing the interchanged matrix
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
			cout << m[i][j] << " ";
		}
		cout << endl;
	}

	return 0;
}
```
