  Task 1: Read and analyze the provided C++/C code.
The code provided is a simple C++ program that converts a decimal number to its binary equivalent. Here are the inputs and outputs of the code, along with their descriptions:

Inputs:

* `n`: The decimal number to be converted.

Outputs:

* `binaryNum`: The binary equivalent of `n`.

These are the inputs and outputs of the code. The inputs are provided through the standard input stream (`std::cin`), while the outputs are returned as an array through the standard output stream (`std::cout`).

Task 2: Generate a detailed natural language summary of the code.
Here is a detailed, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language summary of the code:

* The first line includes the header file `<iostream>`, which contains functions for input and output.
* The second line uses the `using namespace std;` directive to bring all standard library functions into the `std` namespace for convenience.
* The third line defines a function called `decToBinary` with a single integer parameter called `n`:
	+ The function takes an integer `n` as its input.
	+ The function stores the binary equivalent of `n` in an array called `binaryNum`.
	+ The function uses a loop to calculate the digits of the binary equivalent.
		- The loop variable `i` counts the number of elements in the `binaryNum` array.
		- The loop variable `j` counts the number of digits in the binary equivalent of `n`.
		- The loop calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 2 until it reaches 0.
		- Each time `n` is divided by 2, `i` is incremented by 1 to store the resulting digit.
		- The `j` loop outputs each digit in the `binaryNum` array, starting from the last one to the first one.
* The fifth line defines a function called `main` with no parameters and a return type of `int`:
	+ The function calculates the binary equivalent of `n` by calling the `decToBinary` function and then printing out the resulting array through the standard output stream (`std::cout`).

Task 3: Generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.
The following is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that captures the logic of the original C++/C code:

```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that converts a decimal to binary
SC_MODULE(BinaryConverter) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for the binary equivalent

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinaryConverter) {
        // Process to convert decimal to binary
        SC_METHOD(decToBinary);
        sensitive << dec_in;
    }

    // Function to convert decimal to binary
    void decToBinary(int n) {
        // Array to store binary equivalent of n
        int binaryNum[32];

        // Counter for binary array
        int i = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            // Storing remainder in binary array
            binaryNum[i] = n % 2;
            n = n / 2;
            i++;
        }

        // Printing binary array in reverse order
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
            binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Instantiating the SystemC module
    SC_MODULE_INSTANCE(BinaryConverter, conv);

    // Connecting the input and output ports
    conv.dec_in(dec_in);
    conv.binary_out(binary_out);

    // Running the SystemC module
    sc_start();

    return 0;
}
```

In this SystemC code, the `BinaryConverter` module defines two input ports (`dec_in`) and one output port (`binary_out`). The `BinaryConverter` module also defines a `decToBinary` method that converts the input decimal number to its binary equivalent and stores the result in an array. The output binary equivalent is then printed out through the `binary_out` port. The `main` function instantiates the `BinaryConverter` module and connects its input and output ports. Finally, the `main` function runs the SystemC module using the `sc_start` method.

To ensure seamless integration with the existing testbench, the generated SystemC code must utilize the `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<int>` signals defined above. These signals are used to connect the `dec_in` and `binary_out` ports of the `BinaryConverter` module to the input and output signals of the testbench, respectively.
