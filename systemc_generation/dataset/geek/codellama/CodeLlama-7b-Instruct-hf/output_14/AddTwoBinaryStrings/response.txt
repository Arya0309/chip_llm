  Tasks:

1. Read and thoroughly analyze the provided C++/C code.
2. Identify the inputs and outputs of the code.
3. Provide a detailed, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language summary that explains:
   - The inputs and outputs of the code.
   - Each major line or block of code and its functionality (e.g., declarations, loops, conditions, data transformations).
4. Finally, based on your analysis, generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.


Note: Your generated SystemC code **must** utilize these signals (or equivalent named ports) so it can integrate seamlessly with our existing testbench.

### Summary

The code is a C++ program that implements an adder for two binary strings. The input is two binary strings, A and B, and the output is the sum of A and B as a string. The code uses a recursive function `addBinary` to calculate the sum and a function `reverse` to reverse the result.


### Explained in SystemC code

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder)
{

    // Input ports for the first number

    sc_in<int> a;

    // Input ports for the second number

    sc_in<int> b;

    // Output port for the sum

    sc_out<int> sum;


### Concstructor

    SC_CTOR(Adder)
    {

        // Process to perform addition

        SC_METHOD(add);

        // make sure to sensitive the inputs

        sensitive << a << b;
    }


// Method to add the two numbers

    void add()
    {
        sum.write(a.read() + b.read());
    }
};
