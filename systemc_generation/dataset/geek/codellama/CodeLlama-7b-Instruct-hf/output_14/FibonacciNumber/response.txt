  Given this C++/C code, the nth Fibonacci number is calculated and output.
int n is input to this function.
 
* After being defined, const int curr = prev1 + prev2; is calculated, and required to be initialized again because variables can't be modified inside a loop. The previous value of n - 1 is prev1, and the previous - 2 is prev2. The original statement would stand out if it had its last exclamation points removed, which means curr remains as the sum of prev1 and prev2.
* Once you exhaust the for loop, the final calculation is current, which holds the value (n-1)!.
The value is returned at the end of the function, and for the C++/C code, the program takes a value from the user, traverses this function, and outputs the result to the screen.
