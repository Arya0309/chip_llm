  The provided C++/C code is a simple program that checks whether a given number is prime or not using the "Simple Trial Division" method. The program takes in a single integer `n` and outputs whether `n` is prime or not.

The inputs of the program are `n`, which is the number that needs to be checked for primality, and the output is whether `n` is prime or not (either "prime" or "not prime").

The program works as follows:

1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime and the program outputs "not prime".
2. For `n>1`, the program checks if `n` is divisible by any number between 1 and `n`. If it is, the program outputs "not prime".
3. If `n` is not divisible by any number between 1 and `n`, it is prime and the program outputs "prime".

To implement this logic in SystemC, we need to create a module that takes in two inputs (`n` and `is_prime`) and outputs a single output (`n`) that indicates whether `n` is prime or not. Here is an example of such a module:
```scss
module Simple_Trial_Division {
    input logic [31:0] n;  // Input for the number to be checked
    output logic is_prime; // Output to indicate whether n is prime

    // Variables to keep track of the count of divisors
    logic [31:0] cnt;

    // Instantiate the inputs and outputs
    logic is_prime_tmp;

    // Calculate the count of divisors
    always_comb begin
        cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) begin
            if (n % i == 0) begin
                cnt++;
            end
        end
    end

    // Check if the number of divisors is greater than 2
    always_comb begin
        is_prime_tmp = (cnt > 2);
    end

    // Output the result
    always_comb begin
        is_prime = is_prime_tmp;
    end
endmodule
```
This module takes in the input `n` and outputs the result `is_prime`. It also defines two internal variables `cnt` to keep track of the count of divisors and `is_prime_tmp` to temporarily store the result of the calculation.

The module performs the calculation in two always blocks:

1. In the first always block, `cnt` is calculated as the number of divisors of `n` between 1 and `n`. This is done by looping over the numbers between 1 and `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by each of them. The divisors are counted using the `cnt` variable.
2. In the second always block, the result of the calculation, whether `n` is prime or not, is determined by checking if the number of divisors is greater than 2. If the number of divisors is greater than 2, `n` is not prime and the `is_prime_tmp` variable is set to 1. Otherwise, `n` is prime and the `is_prime_tmp` variable is set to 0.

Finally, the result of the calculation is output to the `is_prime` output port.

Note that the `is_prime` input port is not used in the module, but it is provided to ensure that the module can be integrated with our existing testbench.
