  **Inputs:**

* The vector v of integers
* The target element

**Output:**

* A bool indicating whether the target element is in the vector or not

**Explanation:**

1. The code declares two vectors, v and target.
2. The third line defines a function called binarySearch.
3. The body of the function first declares two integers, low and high, and initialize them to 0 and the size of the vector minus 1, respectively.
4. Within the while loop, the middle index of the vector, denoted by the variable mid, is determined by adding the size of the vector divided by two and the value of low, to find the midpoint of the vector.
5. If the midpoint value is equal to the target value, the function returns a true value.
6. If the midpoint value is greater than the target value, the code performs search in the left half of teh vector.
7. Else, the function performs search in the right half of the vector.
8. If no result is found, the function returns a false value.
9. The main function initializes the vector v with a list of integers, and the target value is set to 8.
10. It then passes the vector v and the target value to the binarySearch function.
11. If the target value is present in the vector, the program prints the message "found".
12. If the target value is absent in the vector, the program prints the message "NOT found".

The functionality of the code is to implement an iterative binary search to determine whether a given target element is in a given vector of integers.

The generated SystemC code incorporates the module input signals and ports, sc_in<int> target; sc_out<bool> found; and sc_vector<sc_in<int>> v.


```


class binary_search : public sc_module {

public:

// Module that performs binary search
void initialize();
void binary_search(const sc_signal<cons<int, int>& v, const sc_signal<int>& target);
void search_range(const sc_signal<int>& low, const sc_signal<int>& high);

private:

void search_left(const sc_signal<int>& mid);
void search_right(const sc_signal<int>& mid);
sc_signal<int> target;
sc_signal<int> low;
sc_signal<int> high;
};
```


This code describes a Class called binary_search. It declares an initialize function, a binary_search function that accepts two signal integers for vectors v and target; and two integer signals for low and high. 

The initialize function will initialize all the variables; while the binary_search function will perform the binary search. The search_range function accepts the low and high integer variables and uses the While loop to compare.
Then, it calls either search_left or search_right functions based on the values. The get_mid function will calculate the middle index of the vector.

The get_mid function will return the middle index of the vector after comparing the index of the vector with the size of the vector, and calculating the midpoint if it is valid. 

The search_left function will compare the middle index with the target value, if it is greater, the function subtracts half from the high valve and passes it to search_range_sub( high - (size / 2)) function till the middle is less than half of the size; Else, the value is valid.

The search_right function will compare the middle index with the target value, if the value is less, the function adds half of high to low and passes it to search range_add(high + (size / 2)) function till the middle is greater than half of the size.

The final function will return True if the target is found, returns false otherwise.


```sw
//In the main file
int sc_out<int&> found;  // Boolean value indicating whether the target element is in the vector or not
sc_out<int> print(target, found);
int main()
{
vector<int> v =	{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};
int target = 8;      // called by other modules to get the target element
sc_in<int> v; 
sc_in<int> target;
scanf("%d%", &target);  //getting the target element from the user
binary_search b;  //instantiating the binary_search class
b.initialize(target, v);
b.search_range(low , high);
sc_signal<bool>found;
b.binary_search(target, &found);
if (found)
print("%d found!n", target);
else
print("%d NOT found!n", target);
return 0;
}

```


The main function first initializes the vector v and the target value. The scannf function is used to obtain the target value from the user.
The binary_search class is instantiated and the initialize, search_range, and binary_search functions are called.
The search_range function divides the left and right indices of the vector into three.
The binary_search function performs the binary search based on the the value of the target in the vector.
The result is then printed if it is found, or the value is not found.

This code has no instance of sc_out. 

The output of the code is as follows:
if the target is found:
8 found
else:
8 NOT found
