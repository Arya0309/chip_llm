  The provided C++/C code is a simple implementation of the selection sort algorithm using a template function. The core logic of the algorithm is to traverse the array, find the smallest element, and swap it with the first element of the unsorted subarray. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

The input to the function is a vector of integers, and the output is a sorted vector of integers. The function uses the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file and the `namespace std` prefix for the majority of its code. The `swap` function is defined separately, taking two integer pointers as input and swapping the values they point to.

The `selectionSort` function is the main logic of the program. It takes an integer array and its size as input, and uses a logic loop to traverse the array, finding the next smallest element (using a min_idx variable) and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted subarray. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

The `printArray` function is used to print the sorted array at the end of the process.

To transfer the same logic to SystemC, we can define the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:

* `clk`: a clock signal for synchronization
* `start`: a signal to start the sort process
* `arr`: an array of integers to be sorted
* `n`: the size of the array

Outputs:

* `done`: a signal indicating that the sort process is complete
* `sorted_arr`: the sorted array

Here is an example SystemC code snippet that implements the same logic:
```scss
#include "systemc.h"

SC_MODULE(SelectionSort) {
    // Inputs
    sc_in<bool> clk;
    sc_in<bool> start;
    sc_in<int> arr[];
    sc_in<int> n;

    // Outputs
    sc_out<bool> done;
    sc_out<int> sorted_arr[];

    // Functions
    void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
            cout << arr[i] << " ";
        cout << endl;
    }

    void selectionSort(int arr[], int n) {
        int i, j, min_idx;
        for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            for (j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx])
                    min_idx = j;
            }
            swap(&arr[min_idx], &arr[i]);
        }
    }

    // Interfaces
    void sortProcess() {
        if (start.read()) {
            selectionSort(arr, n.read());
            printArray(sorted_arr, n.read());
            done.write(true);
        }
    }

    SC_CTOR(SelectionSort) {
        SC_METHOD(sortProcess);
        sensitive << clk.pos();
    }
};
```
This SystemC code uses the SystemC `sc_in` and `sc_out` interfaces to connect the inputs and outputs of the `SelectionSort` module, and the `selectionSort` function to implement the logic of the original C++/C code. The `printArray` function is also implemented in SystemC to print the sorted array.

Note that the SystemC code includes a `sortProcess` method that is sensitive to the `clk.pos()` signal. This method is called at each rising clock edge and performs the sorting process. The `done` signal is asserted when the sorting process is complete.
