  The provided C++/C code is a simple program to find the sum of the diagonals of a matrix. The code accepts an integer matrix as input (via the `mat` array) and its size (`n`) as input via the command line. The program then iterates through the matrix and calculates the sum of the principal and secondary diagonals.

Inputs:

* The input integer matrix is represented as a two-dimensional array `mat` of size `n x n`.
* The input size `n` is represented as a scalar integer.

Outputs:

* The principal diagonal sum is represented as a scalar integer `principal`.
* The secondary diagonal sum is represented as a scalar integer `secondary`.

Line-by-Line Explanation:

1. `const int MAX = 100;` - Declares a constant variable `MAX` with value 100, which is used as a limit for the size of the matrix.
2. `void printDiagonalSums(int mat[][MAX], int n) {` - Declares a function `printDiagonalSums` that takes an integer matrix `mat` of size `n x n`, and an integer `n` as input, and returns two scalar integers `principal` and `secondary`.
3. `int principal = 0, secondary = 0;` - Declares two scalar integers `principal` and `secondary` with initial value 0, which are used to store the sums of the principal and secondary diagonals respectively.
4. `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {` - Iterates through the rows of the matrix `mat`.
5. `for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)	  {` - Iterates through the columns of the matrix `mat`.
6. `if (i == j)  principal += mat[i][j];` - If the current row and column indices `i` and `j` match, adds the element at the corresponding position in the matrix to the `principal` sum.
7. `if ((i + j) == (n - 1))  secondary += mat[i][j];` - If the sum of the row and column indices `i` and `j` equals the length of the matrix `n - 1`, adds the element at the corresponding position in the matrix to the `secondary` sum.
8. `}` - Closes the inner loop.
9. `}` - Closes the outer loop.
10. `cout << "Principal Diagonal:" << 
 principal << endl;` - Prints the `principal` sum to the console with a label "Principal Diagonal".
11. `cout << "Secondary Diagonal:" << 
 secondary << endl;` - Prints the `secondary` sum to the console with a label "Secondary Diagonal".
12. `} //void printDiagonalSums(int mat[][MAX], int n) {` - Closes the `printDiagonalSums` function.
13. `int main() {` - Declares the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.
14. `int a[][MAX] = {{1, 2, 3, 4},` - Declares a 2D integer array `a` with size `4 x 4`.
15. `{5, 6, 7, 8},` - Populates the first row of the array with values `1, 2, 3, 4`.
16. `{1, 2, 3, 4},` - Populates the second row of the array with values `5, 6, 7, 8`.
17. `{5, 6, 7, 8}}; //int a[][MAX];` - Closes the `a` array.
18. `printDiagonalSums(a, 4); //void printDiagonalSums(int mat[][MAX], int n)` - Calls the `printDiagonalSums` function with the `a` matrix and size `4`.
19. `return 0;` - Returns an integer 0 to indicate successful termination of the program.
20. `}` - Closes the `main` function.

Explanation:

The SystemC code starts with the inclusion of the `<systemc.h>` header file, which provides the necessary functions and classes for synchronous simulation. The `DiagonalSum` module is defined, which takes two input signals `matrix` and `size`, and two output signals `principal` and `secondary`.

The `printDiagonalSums` method is defined, which iterates through the rows and columns of the input matrix `matrix`, and calculates the sum of the principal and secondary diagonals. The `principal` and `secondary` sums are updated using the `+= operator`.

The `driver` code is defined in the `sc_main` function, which instantiates the `DiagonalSum` module, and connects the input and output ports using the `SC_SIG` macro. The clock and reset are defined, and the simulation is run for 50 nanoseconds using the `sc_start` function. Finally, the output signals are printed to the console using the `cout` statement.

In this solution, the `DiagonalSum` module is self-contained, and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow. The SystemC code captures the logic of the original C++/C source, and can be compiled and simulated using the `systemc` compiler and tools.
