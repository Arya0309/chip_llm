  Due to the nature of Pythonâ€™s straightforward syntax, It is possible to create complicated utilities with just a few lines of code just like HTML, but using template literals.`Template literals` are a coding mechanism in Python, which allows developers to write extremely large and complex scripts.

Controller Driven Programming (CDP) is a concise and efficient method for writing text-based controls in programming languages such as Python, although it is most typically accomplished with yaml or json to represent control configurations. 

Enta is a tool that is made specifically to program entanglement-aware links with the goal of developing quantum teleportation and semi-random entanglement. 


Entanglement Swapping : They are quantum entanglements which can change the entanglement of another as long as one lies in their vicinity.
