  For this task, we will analyze the supplied C++/C code and generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic. The given code determines whether a given year is a leap year or not. The main method calls the checkYear function, which performs a series of comparisons to determine whether the input year is a leap year or not.

Inputs/Outputs: The code has inputs via the year variable, and outputs via the is_leap_year variable. The year input is an integer representing the year to be checked for leapiness, while the output is a Boolean value indicating whether the input year is a leap year or not.

Line-by-line or Block-by-Block explanation of the code:

The commented header indicates a preprocessor directives preceding the actual code. These directives enable using the std namespace for input and output operations, as well as to list declarations of functions and variables used in the code that normally reside in a namespace separate from the global namespace.

Line 6 contains a repeatable structure that declares a checkYear function. The return type bool and function signature is a class template that takes an integer input by value, and the return value is a boolean type indicating whether the year parameter is a leap year or not.

The function deals with different conditions to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not.

In the first if statement of checkYear(year), it checks whether the year is a multiple of 400 using the modulo operator. If it is a multiple of 400, then it outputs a Boolean true value indicating it is a leap year.

In the second if statement, it determines whether a given year is a leap year or not, provided it is not a multiple of 1000 but is a multiple of 4 or 100, and returns a Boolean false value.
It accomplishes this by first calculating the remainder when divided by 100 and double checking whether it is a multiple of 4 or 100.

The final if statement finds out if a given year is a leap year or not using the same logic stated above.

In the Driver class, the year 2000 is used to check if it is a leap year or not. Afterwards, the result from the checkYear function is checked and outputted to the user using a standard output stream.

Now what I'll proceed to do is provide a SystemC equivalent that captures the logic of the original C++/C source code:

#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks if a given year is a leap year or not
 SC_MODULE(checkYear) {
 sc_in<int>year;  // Input port for the year to be checked for leapiness
 sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;  // Output port for the result of the check

 // Constructor
 SC_CTOR(checkYear) {
 // Process to perform the year check
 SC_METHOD(is_leap_year);
 sensitive <<year;
 is_leap_year.write(year.read() % 400 == 0);
 }
 }

// Driver code
 int main(int argc, char*argv[])
 {
 int year = 2000;

 checkYear year_module

year_module.year.write(year);
year_module.is_leap_year.write(is_leap_year.read());
return 0;
}

This SystemC code module has inputs via the year variable, and outputs via the is_leap_year variable. The year input is an integer representing the year to be checked for leapiness, while the output is a boolean type indicating whether it is a leap year or not. 

The checkYear module is a line-by-line or block-by-block equivalent of the checkYear method. It initializes a method that checks the year input for legality.

The first if statement checks whether the year is divisible by 400 and outputs a Boolean true if it is a leap year. If not a multiple of 400, it checks whether or not it is divisible by 100 in the second if statement. If it doesn't make a multiple of 100 but is a divisible by either 4 or 100, it checks whether it is a leap year and outputs a false Boolean value. This determination makes use of the modulo operator.

Finally, the third if statement is the only other possibility left and determines the given year is a leap year or not, and outputs a Boolean false value if any of the conditions above are not met.

The Driver code can use a checkYear module instance to determine whether the input year is a leap year or not. The code then reads the checkYear module's output Boolean value to determine if it is a leap year or not.
