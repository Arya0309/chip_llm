  Sure, I can help you with that. Based on the provided C++/C code, here's a natural language summary of the code's functionality:

The provided C++/C program implements a linear search algorithm iteratively. It searches a vector of integers for a given key. The input to the program is a vector of integers, a key to search, and an output for the return value. The program iterates through the vector, checks each element against the key, and returns the index of the element if it is found or -1 otherwise. The program's output is the index of the element or -1 if the key was not found.

In terms of its functionality, the code uses a for loop to iterate through the vector, checks each index against the key, and returns the index if the key is found or -1 if it is not. The program's output is the index of the element or -1 if it is not found.

Now that you have a clear understanding of the code's functionality, you can generate equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic:

```systemCsharp
#include<systemc.h>

// Module that implements the linear search algorithm 
SC_MODULE(LinearSearch)
{
  // Inputs 
  sc_in<int> key;    // Key to search for  
  sc_in<int> v;      // Vector to search in
  sc_out<int> index; // Output index

  // Outputs
  sc_out<bool> searchStatus; // Status of search
  
  // Constructor
  SC_CTOR(LinearSearch)
  {
    SC_METHOD(search);
    sensitive<<v<<key<<index;
  }
  
  // Method to perform search
  void search()
  {
    int i;
    
    // Iterate through vector
    for(i=0; i<v.size(); i++)
    {
      // Check if key is found
      if(v[i]==key)
      {
        index.write(i);
        searchStatus.write(true);
        return;
      }
    }
    
    // Key not found
    index.write(-1);
    searchStatus.write(false);
  }
};
```

In the SystemC code, I have incorporated the signals defined above and generated a module that implements the linear search algorithm iteratively. The module takes in the vector to search in, a key to search for, and an output for the return value. The module iterates through the vector, checks each element against the key, and returns the index of the element if it is found or -1 otherwise. Finally, the module's output is the index of the element or -1 if it is not found, and a status of successful search or not found.
