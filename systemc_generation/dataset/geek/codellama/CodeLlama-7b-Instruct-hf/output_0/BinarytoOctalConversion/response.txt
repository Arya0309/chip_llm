  Here's the summary of the provided C++ code and the SystemC code that captures the same behavior:

Summary:

This C++ code defines a function called "octalToDecimal" that converts an octal input to its corresponding decimal output. The function works by iterating through the octal input's digits from right to left, using the base-8 representation of the digits to calculate the corresponding decimal values. The final value is returned as the decimal output.

SystemC Code:

Here's an example SystemC code snippet that captures the behavior of the C++ function:
```C
// SystemC code to convert octal to decimal
#include <systemc>

// Declaration of the input and output signals
sc_in<int> octal_input; // Receives the octal input
sc_out<int> decimal_output; // Returns the decimal output

// Function to convert octal to decimal
void octalToDecimal(int n)
{
    int num = n;
    int dec_value = 0;
    int base = 1;
    int temp = num;
    while (temp) {
        int last_digit = temp % 10;
        temp = temp / 10;
        dec_value += last_digit * base;
        base = base * 8;
    }
    return dec_value;
}

// Driver code
void main()
{
    int num = 67;
    octal_input = num;
    decimal_output = octalToDecimal(num);
}
```
In this SystemC code, the "sc_in" and "sc_out" signals are used to receive the input and output values, respectively. The "octalToDecimal" function is defined as before, with the same structure and logic as the C++ code. The "main" function initializes the input signal, calls the "octalToDecimal" function to perform the conversion, and writes the output to the "decimal_output" signal. The output can be read from the "decimal_output" signal in the testbench.
