  C++/C Code:
-----------------------

This C++/C code is designed to find the trace and normal of a matrix. The input is a matrix of size `100 x 100`, and the output is the trace and normal of the matrix.

### Inputs and Outputs

The inputs to the code are:

* `matrix`: a matrix of size `100 x 100`, represented as a two-dimensional array.

The outputs from the code are:

* `trace`: the trace of the matrix, represented as an integer.
* `norm`: the normal of the matrix, represented as an integer.

### Explanation

The code consists of two major functions, `findTrace()` and `findNormal()`, which are called in the `main()` function to compute the trace and normal of the matrix.

#### findTrace()

The `findTrace()` function takes in a matrix `mat` of size `n x n`, where `n` is constant and equal to `100`, and returns the trace of the matrix, which is the sum of the elements on the diagonal.

The function loops over the elements of the matrix and sums up the elements of the diagonal. It uses a nested loop to iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix.

#### findNormal()

The `findNormal()` function takes in a matrix `mat` of size `n x n`, where `n` is constant and equal to `100`, and returns the normal of the matrix, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the elements.

The function loops over the elements of the matrix and sums up the squares of the elements. It uses a nested loop to iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix.

### Equivalent SystemC Code

The following is the equivalent SystemC code:
```
#include "systemc.h"

const int SIZE = 100;

void findTrace(const matrix[SIZE][SIZE], trace);
void findNormal(const matrix[SIZE][SIZE], norm);

void main() {
  int matrix[SIZE][SIZE] = ...; // Initialize the matrix

  int trace;
  int norm;

  findTrace(matrix, trace);
  findNormal(matrix, norm);

  cout << "Trace of the matrix: " << trace << endl;
  cout << "Normal of the matrix: " << norm << endl;

  return 0;
}

void findTrace(const matrix[SIZE][SIZE], int trace) {
  for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
    trace += matrix[i][i];
  }
}

void findNormal(const matrix[SIZE][SIZE], int norm) {
  for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; i < SIZE; j++) {
      norm += matrix[i][j] * matrix[i][j];
    }
  }
  norm = sqrt(norm);
}
```
The SystemC code captures the same logic as the C++/C code, but uses SystemC as a higher-level language. The `main()` function is used to initialize the matrix, compute the trace and normal, and print the results. The `findTrace()` and `findNormal()` functions are defined as modules, which are reusable components that can be instantiated in the `main()` function. The functions take in a matrix and an output variable, and compute the corresponding trace or normal. The return statements are used to return the computed values.
