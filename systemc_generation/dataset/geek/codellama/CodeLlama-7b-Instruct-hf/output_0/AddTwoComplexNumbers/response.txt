  The provided C++/C code is a program that calculates the sum of two complex numbers using the Complex class. The code uses a constructor to accept the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers and defines a method, `addComp()`, to add two complex numbers. The `main()` function creates two Complex objects and then calls the `addComp()` method to calculate the sum.

The input(s) of the code are the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers. The output(s) are the real and imaginary parts of the sum of the two complex numbers.

The code can be broken down into the following blocks:

* The Complex class defines a custom data type to represent complex numbers.
* The constructor for the Complex class initializes the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
* The addComp() method defines a function to add two complex numbers. It creates a temporary variable to store the sum, adds the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers, and returns the sum.
* The main() function creates two Complex objects, C1 and C2, and calls the addComp() method to calculate the sum. The sum is stored in a new Complex object, C3, and its real and imaginary parts are printed.

The equivalent SystemC code would be:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// The Complex class is defined in C++
SC_MODULE(Complex) {
    sc_in<int> real;     // input port for real part of complex number
    sc_in<int> imaginary; // input port for imaginary part of complex number
    sc_out<int> temp;    // output port for temporary sum

    // constructor for Complex class
    SC_CTOR(Complex) : real(real), imaginary(imaginary) { }

    // addComp method for adding two complex numbers
    SC_METHOD(addComp, real, imaginary) {
        // temporary variable for storing sum
        Complex temp();

        // add real and imaginary parts of complex numbers
        temp.real = real + imaginary;
        temp.imaginary = temp.imaginary + imaginary;

        // return sum
        return temp;
    }
};

// Main() function
SC_MODULE(Main) {
    // sc_in<int> for real and imaginary parts of 2 complex numbers
    sc_in<int> real1, real2;
    sc_in<int> imag1, imag2;

    // sc_out<int> for real and imaginary parts of sum of complex numbers
    sc_out<int> real_sum, imag_sum;

    // Complex object for C1
    Complex C1(real1, imag1);

    // Complex objec for C2
    Complex C2(real2, imag2);

    // SC_METHOD for adding complex numbers
    SC_METHOD(add) {
        // create temporary variable for sum
        Complex temp();

        // add real and imaginary parts of complex numbers
        temp.real = real1 + imag1;
        temp.imaginary = temp.imaginary + imag2;

        // return sum
        return temp;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the Complex class is defined and has input and output ports for the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. The addComp() method is defined to add two complex numbers. The main() function creates two Complex objects and calls the addComp() method to calculate the sum. The resulting sum is stored in a new Complex object and its real and imaginary parts are printed.

Note that the SystemC code utilizes the `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<int>` ports to connect the inputs and outputs of the code to the testbench.
