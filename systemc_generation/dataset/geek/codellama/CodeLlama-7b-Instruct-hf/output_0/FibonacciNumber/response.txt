  Tasks:

1. Read and thoroughly analyze the provided C++/C code.
2. Identify the input(s) and output(s) of the code.
3. Provide a detailed, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language summary that explains:
   1. The inputs and outputs of the code.
   2. Each major line or block of code and its functionality (e.g., declarations, loops, conditions, data transformations).
4. Finally, based on your analysis, generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.

C++/C Code:
```
// C++ Program to find the nth fibonacci number using loops
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int fib(int n) {
    // For 0th and 1st term
    if (n <= 1)
        return n;

    // Variable to store the last two terms
    int prev1 = 1, prev2 = 0;

    // Variable that stores the current fibonacci term
    int curr;

    // Calculating the next fibonacci number by using
    // the previous two number
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        curr = prev1 + prev2;
        prev2 = prev1;
        prev1 = curr;
    }
    return curr;
}

int main() {
    int n = 5;

    // Finding the nth fibonacci number
    cout << fib(n);
    return 0;
}
```

Input: `int n`
Output: `fib(n)`

Explanation:

The input `int n` is used to calculate the nth fibonacci number using the loop. The loop calculates each term of the fibonacci sequence using the previous two terms until the nth term is obtained. The ouput `fib(n)` is the final nth fibonacci number calculated by the loop.

SystemC Code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that calculates the nth fibonacci number
SC_MODULE(Fibonacci) {
    sc_in<int> n;  // Input port for the n value
    sc_out<int> result; // Output port for the fibonacci number

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Fibonacci) {
        // Process to calculate the fibonacci number
        SC_METHOD(fib);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to calculate the fibonacci number
    void fib() {
        // Initialize the last two terms
        int prev1 = 1, prev2 = 0;

        // For each term in the fibonacci sequence
        for (int i = 2; i <= n(); i++) {
            // Calculate the next fibonacci number
            int curr = prev1 + prev2;
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = curr;
        }

        // Output the final fibonacci number
        result.write(curr);
    }
};
```
Note that the SystemC code uses the `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals to integrate with the provided input and output signals. The `sc_method` member allows the object to create a process that executes a method when enabled. The `sensitive` construct specifies the signals that the process is sensitive to.
