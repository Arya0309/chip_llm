  **Inputs and Outputs**

The inputs of the code are:

* An array of integers of size n x n.
* An integer value of n, which represents the size of the input array.

The output of the code is:

* An array of integers of size n x n, which is the interchanged matrix.

**Summary**

The code demonstrates a simple 2D array manipulation task to swap the elements of the first and last columns. The major blocks of code include:

1. A function named `interchangeFirstLast`, which takes an array of integers as an input and swaps the elements of its first and last columns. The function iterates over each column and swaps the elements in O(n) time using an auxiliary variable and two pointer variables. The function uses a for-loop to iterate over each row and swaps the elements of the first and last columns in O(1) time.
2. A main function that reads an input array from the user, invokes the `interchangeFirstLast` function to swap the elements of its first and last columns, and then prints the interchanged matrix to the console. The main function uses a for-loop to iterate over each row and for-loop to iterate over each column, and relies on the `iostream` library for input/output operations.

**Equivalent SystemC Code Snippet**

Here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to swap the elements of first and last columns
SC_MODULE(SwapColumns) {
    sc_in<int> in[SIZE];
    sc_out<int> out[SIZE];

    // Function to swap the elements of the first and last columns
    void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n]) {
        // Swapping of element between first and last columns
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int t = m[i][0];
            m[i][0] = m[i][n - 1];
            m[i][n - 1] = t;
        }
    }

    // Main process
    sc_method(interchangeFirstLast);
    sensitive << in[0] << in[n - 1];

    // Printing the interchanged matrix
    sc_method(print_array);
    sensitive << out[0] << out[n - 1];
};

int sc_main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Driver code
    SwapColumns swapColumns();
    int m[n][n] = {{8, 9, 7, 6},
                    {4, 7, 6, 5},
                    {3, 2, 1, 8},
                    {9, 9, 7, 7}};

    swapColumns.in[0] = m[0][0];
    swapColumns.in[n - 1] = m[0][n - 1];

    swapColumns.interchangeFirstLast();

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            cout << " " << swapColumns.out[i][j];
            cout << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
The SystemC code uses the same data types and variables as the C++ code. The `interchangeFirstLast` function is defined as a process in SystemC, and its input and output ports are connected using the `in` and `out` arrays. The `main` function is defined inline, and its driver code is defined using the `SwapColumns` module. The `print_array` method is also defined inline to print the interchanged matrix.

 Ensure that the SystemC code you provide faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source. The explanation must be thorough and accessible.
