  Given the provided C++/C code, the following is a natural language summary of its functionality:

1. Inputs:
	* 2 integers, a and b
2. Outputs:
	* 1 integer, the gcd of a and b
3. Explanation:
	* The function gcd uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two given integers, a and b. The algorithm starts by finding the minimum of a and b, which is stored in the variable res.
	* The algorithm then checks if the inputs can be divided by res without a remainder by comparing the remainder of a and b to res. If either a or b is divisible by res, the algorithm breaks out of the loop and returns res.
	* If no divisibility is found, the algorithm decrements res and repeats the process until res is 1, at which point the algorithm returns res as the gcd of a and b.
4. SystemC code:
```sc
        // declarations
SC_MODULE(code) {
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;
    sc_out<int> gcd;

    // process
    SC_METHOD(process);
    sensitive << a << b;

    // method
    void process() {
        int res = min(a, b);
        while (res > 1) {
            if (a % res == 0 && b % res == 0)
                break;
            res--;
        }
        gcd.write(res);
    }
};
```
5. Description of SystemC code
The SystemC code declares a module that takes in two integers, a and b, as inputs and returns the gcd of a and b as an output. The module declares a process that uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd of a and b. The process starts by finding the minimum of a and b, storing the result in the variable res. The process then checks if the inputs can be divided by res without a remainder by comparing the remainder of a and b to res. If either a or b is divisible by res, the process breaks out of the loop and returns res as the gcd. If no divisibility is found, the process decrements res and repeats the process until res is 1, at which point the process returns res as the gcd. The module incorporates the signals defined above. The code is in a compilable snippet.
