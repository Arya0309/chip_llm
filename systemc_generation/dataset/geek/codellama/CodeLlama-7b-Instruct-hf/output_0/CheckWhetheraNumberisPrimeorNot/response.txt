  This is a challenging task that requires a deep understanding of both C++/C and SystemC. Here is my solution, broken down into the following sections:

I. Overview and Analysis of the Original C++/C Code:

The provided code is a C++ program that checks if a given integer is a prime number using simple trial division. The code declares an integer named `n` and initializes it to 29. It then declares an integer named `cnt` and sets it to 0.

The main logic of the code is handled within an `if-else` block that checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, then `n` is printed as not prime, otherwise, the code enters a loop that checks for divisors of `n` between 1 and `n`. The loop increments a counter `cnt` every time `n` is divisible by `i` inside the loop. If `cnt > 2`, then `n` is printed as not prime, otherwise, `n` is printed as prime.

II. Identify the Input(s) and Output(s) of the Code:

The only input to this code is an integer `n`, and the output is a boolean flag indicating whether `n` is prime or not prime.

III. Line-by-line or Block-by-block Natural Language Summary:

The code is divided into several blocks, with each block containing a logical unit of functionality. Here is a breakdown of the major blocks and their functionality:

1. `int n = 29`: Declares and initializes an integer variable `n` with a value of 29.
2. `int cnt = 0`: Declares and initializes an integer variable `cnt` with a value of 0.
3. `if (n <= 1)`: Checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If this condition is true, then print `n` as not prime.
4. `else`: If the previous condition is false, then enter the loop that checks for divisors of `n`.
5. `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)`: Iterates over the range of values between 1 and `n`.
6. `if (n % i == 0)`: Checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If this condition is true, then increment `cnt` by 1.
7. `else`: If the previous condition is false, then `n` is not divisible by `i`, so no action is taken.
8. `if (cnt > 2)`: Checks if `cnt` is greater than 2. If this condition is true, then `n` is not prime, so print `n` as not prime.
9. `else`: If the previous condition is false, then `cnt` is 0 or 1, so `n` is prime, so print `n` as prime.

IV. Equivalent SystemC Code:

Here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that captures the functionality of the original C++/C code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks if a number is prime using simple trial division
SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n; // Input port for the number to be checked
    sc_out<bool> is_prime; // Output port for whether `n` is prime or not prime

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        // Process to check if `n` is prime
        SC_METHOD(check_prime);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to check if `n` is prime
    void check_prime() {
        int cnt = 0;

        // Check if `n` is less than or equal to 1
        if (n <= 1) {
            is_prime.write(false);
            return;
        }

        // Iterate over the range of values between 1 and `n`
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // Check if `n` is divisible by `i`
            if (n % i == 0) {
                cnt++;
            }
        }

        // Check if `n` has more than 2 divisors
        if (cnt > 2) {
            is_prime.write(false);
            return;
        }

        is_prime.write(true);
    }
};
```

The above SystemC code uses the inputs `n` and `is_prime` from the `PrimeChecker` module. It also uses the `is_prime` output to determine whether `n` is prime or not prime. The code uses a similar logic to the original C++/C code, with minor variations to handle the different programming constructs available in SystemC.

In conclusion, this code is a straightforward implementation of the prime number check using simple trial division. The resulting SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C code, making it a valuable resource for high-level synthesis flows.
