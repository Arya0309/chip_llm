  **C++/C Code**:

The following code is a C++ program that finds the minimum (or maximum) element in an array. It uses the `min_element()` and `max_element()` functions provided by the standard library to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array, respectively. Finally, the program prints the minimum and maximum elements to the console.

**Summary**

The C++ program takes an array `arr` of integers of length `n` as input, and the program prints the minimum and maximum elements of the array to the console. The `min_element()` function returns a pointer to the first element in the range that is less than or equal to all other elements, while the `max_element()` function returns a pointer to the first element in the range that is greater than or equal to all other elements. The `sizeof()` operator is used to find the length of the array, and the `cout` statement is used to print the minimum and maximum elements to the console.

**SystemC Code**

Here is an equivalent SystemC code that captures the logic of the original C++/C source:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that finds the minimum and maximum elements in an array
SC_MODULE(Array) {
    sc_in<int> arr[n];  // Input port for the array
    sc_out<int> min_val; // Output port for the minimum element
    sc_out<int> max_val; // Output port for the maximum element

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Array) {
        // Process to find the minimum and maximum elements
        SC_METHOD(find_min_max);
        sensitive << arr;
    }

    // Method to find the minimum and maximum elements
    void find_min_max() {
        int min_idx = 0, max_idx = 0;
        // Find the minimum and maximum elements in the array
        int min_val = arr[0], max_val = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] < min_val) min_val = arr[i], min_idx = i;
            if (arr[i] > max_val) max_val = arr[i], max_idx = i;
        }
        // Output the minimum and maximum elements to the console
        cout << "Minimum element: " << min_val << endl;
        cout << "Maximum element: " << max_val << endl;
    }
};
```
The SystemC module takes an array `arr` of integers of length `n` as input, and outputs the minimum and maximum elements in the array. The `find_min_max()` method uses a similar logic to the original C++/C source code to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array, and then outputs the results to the console using the `cout` statement.

Note that the `sensitive` keyword is used to specify that the `find_min_max()` method should be triggered whenever the `arr` input changes. This ensures that the method will be executed automatically whenever the input array changes, which is important for reactive design.

Overall, the SystemC code preserves the logic of the original C++/C source and can be used in a reactive design flow.
