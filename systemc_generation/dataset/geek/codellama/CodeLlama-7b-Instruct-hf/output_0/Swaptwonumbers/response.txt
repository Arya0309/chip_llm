  The provided C++/C code shows a basic understanding of variables and data transformations.

The input for this code is two integer variables, a and b. There are also two output variables, out_a and out_b.

Here's the detailed line-by-line explanation of the code:
Line 1-4: the header file <bits/stdc++.h> includes the standard library namespace using the keyword "using namespace std". This allows the code to access its functions referenced without needing this namespace name each time.

Line 5-8: The variables a and b are declared and the value is assigned 2 and 3 respectively. Then, two output variables, out_a and out_b, are declared.

Line 9-12: The temporary variable temp is declared and the value of a is assigned to it. Then, a's value is transformed to b's temp value, and b's value is transformed to b's former temp value through the swap logic.

Line 13-16: The final outputs for out_a and out_b were set. The program prints both a's old value and b's old value.

Line 17: the main function ends, and the program terminates.

Based on the above understanding of the code, the C++ code can be converted to SystemC as follows:

// Module to swap the values between a and b
SC_MODULE(ReversorF) {
sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
sc_in<int> b;    // Input port for the second number
sc_out<int> out_a; // Output port for the first number
sc_out<int> out_b;       // Output port for the second number

// Constructor
SC_CTOR(reversorF) {

// Process to perform swapping
SC_METHOD(swap);

// Signal required for swapping logic
sc_signal<int> temp;
sensitive << a << b;
 }

// Method to swap the two numbers
void swap() {
temp.write(a.read());
a.write(b.read());
b.write(temp.read());

out_a.write(a);
out_b.write(b);
}
};
