  The provided C++/C source code is a program for implementing the selection sort algorithm. The program takes an array of integers as input and sorts it in ascending order using selection sort.

The main function of the program is shown below:
```
int main() 
{ 
	int arr[] = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11}; 
	int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]); 
	selectionSort(arr, n); 
	cout << "Sorted array: ";
	printArray(arr, n);
	return 0;
}
```
This function first initializes an array with the integers 64, 25, 12, 22, and 11, and then sorts the array using the selectionSort function. Finally, it prints the sorted array to the console.

The selectionSort function is defined below:
```
 void selectionSort(int arr[], int n) 
{ 
	int i, j, min_idx; 

	// One by one move boundary of 
	// unsorted subarray 
	for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) 
	{ 
		
		// Find the minimum element in 
		// unsorted array 
		min_idx = i; 
		for (j = i+1; j < n; j++) 
		if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) 
			min_idx = j; 

		// Swap the found minimum element 
		// with the first element 
		swap(&arr[min_idx], &arr[i]); 
	} 
}
```
This function takes an array of integers and its size as input, and sorts the array in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.

The swap function is defined below:
```
void swap(int *xp, int *yp) 
{ 
	int temp = *xp; 
	*xp = *yp; 
	*yp = temp; 
} 
```
This function takes two pointers to two integers and swaps their values.

The printArray function is defined below:
```
void printArray(int arr[], int size) 
{ 
	int i; 
	for (i=0; i < size; i++) 
		cout << arr[i] << " "; 
	cout << endl; 
}
```
This function takes an array of integers and its size as input and prints the array to the console in a formatting suitable for easy reading.

In summary, the provided C++/C code sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm. The code uses the selectionSort function, which takes the array and its size as input and sorts the array, and the printArray function, which prints the sorted array to the console.

Here's an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the original code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(selectionSort) {
    sc_in<int> arr; // Input port for the array
    sc_in<int> n; // Input port for the size of the array
    sc_out<int> sortedArr; // Output port for the sorted array

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(selectionSort) {
        // Process to perform selection sort
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << arr << n;
    }

    // Function to sort the array
    void sort() {
        int i, j, min_idx;
        // One by one move boundary of 
        // unsorted subarray 
        for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            // Find the minimum element in 
            // unsorted array 
            min_idx = i;
            for (j = i+1; j < n; j++)
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx])
                    min_idx = j;

            // Swap the found minimum element 
            // with the first element 
            swap(&arr[min_idx], &arr[i]);
        }
    }

    // Function to swap two numbers
    void swap(int *xp, int *yp) {
        int temp = *xp;
        *xp = *yp;
        *yp = temp;
    }

    // Function to print the sorted array
    void print() {
        int i;
        for (i=0; i < n; i++)
            cout << arr[i] << " ";
        cout << endl;
    }
};
```
This SystemC code defines a module named selectionSort that takes an array and its size as input. It has three functions: sort, swap, and print, which perform the same operations as the corresponding functions in the C++/C code.

In summary, this SystemC code has the same behavior as the original C++/C source code, but it uses SystemC constructs for signaling and process synchronization, which allows it to be integrated with an existing testbench that uses the signals defined above.
