  The provided C++/C code is a simple program that calculates the average of an array of integers. The code consists of a function named `average` that takes an array of integers and its size as inputs and returns the average as an output. The `main` function contains an array of integers and its size, and calls the `average` function to calculate the average.

The natural language summary of the code is as follows:

The code takes an array of integers as input and its size as another input. The `average` function finds the sum of the array elements and divides it by the size of the array to get the average. The `main` function creates an array of integers and its size, calls the `average` function with the array and its size as inputs, and prints the output to the console.

The equivalent SystemC code is as follows:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Average) {
    sc_in<int> arr;
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<double> average;

    SC_CTOR(Average) : average("average") {
        arr.bind(data_in);
        n.bind(data_in.size());
        average.bind(average_out);
    }

    void average() {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            sum += arr[i];
        average.write((double)sum / n);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `Average` module takes an array named `arr` and its size named `n` as inputs. The `average` function calculates the sum of the array elements and divides it by the size of the array to get the average. The `average` function is called once in the `main` function and its output is bound to the `average_out` port of the `Average` module.

To synthesize this module using a high-level synthesis flow, one needs to define the data types, ports, and module interface in a system-level description. The `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<double>` types indicate that the input and output are integer and floating-point numbers, respectively. The `sc_vector` type indicates that the `data_in` port is a vector of `sc_in<int>` elements. The `<<int>` indicates that the `average` function returns an integer.

The port bindings can be used to connect the inputs and outputs of the module to the `data_in` and `average_out` signals. The `sc_vector` functionality can be used to iterate over the elements of the input array and calculate the sum of the array elements. The module interface defines the data types, ports, and module functionality, and it is used to generate a logic netlist for FPGA or ASIC synthesis.

Overall, the SystemC code captures the logic of the original C++/C code, and the input and output of the module are clearly defined using signals. The module interface can be used to generate a synthesizable module that can be integrated with a high-level synthesis flow.
