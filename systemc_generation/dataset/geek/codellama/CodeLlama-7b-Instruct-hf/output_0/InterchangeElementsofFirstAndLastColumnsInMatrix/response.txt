  This code exchanges the values in the first and last rows of a matrix. The output is then printed.

The code can be extended to come up with a pointer to the array. If required, it should be modified to receive a pointer as an input.

Input: An integer array.

Output: Same integer array but with the values in the first and last rows exchanged. 

This is how the SystemC code should look like:
```
#include <systemc.h>
#define n 4

// Module that swaps the values in the first and last rows of a matrix
SC_MODULE(swap_rows) {
    sc_in<int>(m)*Note 1) the array has a size of 4.
    sc_out<int>(m)*Note 2) the array has a size of 4.

    // Method to exchange the values for the first and last rows
    void exchange() {
        int rows = n;
        sc_in<int> in[rows];
        sc_out<int> out[rows];
        
        // for each pair of values, swap them
        for (int i=0; i<rows; i++) {
          int a = m[rows-1][i];
            int b = m[0][i];
            m[0][i] = a;
            m[rows-1][i] = b;
        }
    }

};
```
Note 1) and Note 2): the arrays have a size of 4. The arrays are not sized in the C++/C code. The memory is allocated elsewhere. 

Note 3) The module is named swap_rows. 

Note 4) The C++/C modules exchange the values in the first and last rows of a matrix. The output is then printed.
