  The provided C++/C code example calculates the determinant of an NxN matrix using a popular method for calculating the determinant of a 2x2 matrix. The matrices a and matrix are used in the methods to obtain their determinants and then calculate the product of their determinants to obtain the final result.

In the provided code snippet, the following is identified:

1. Input(s):
	* a[SIZE]: a double array that stores the input matrix.
2. Output(s):
	* det: a double variable that stores the determinant of the input matrix.
3. Major line(s) of code:
	* a[i][j] = matrix[i][j]: a[0][j] stores the jth value (column) of the input matrix, and the jth row of a[0] is populated. This process generates a[n][MAXN], with n being the number of rows in the input matrix.
	* det *= -1: This expresses the logic of swapping the input row with the row indicated by the pivot if it is not equal to the pivot row. After the current row is swapped, the delta is multiplied by a -1 to signify the shift.
	* det *= a[i][i]: Here, det is set equal to the nth squaring of the row's leading coefficient, which is equal to the product of the previous N determinants.
	* for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++): for (int k = i + 1; k < n; k++): Each of N - 1 is performed on a row called j during the outer cycle, where j > i. Called b. The sheet with a row header being j is each row of a[MAXN][MAXN]. Each element in a[j] is multiplied by a[i][k ]- a[j][k], populating the values of a[j][k] in the same manner as in the outer cycle.
4. Equivalent SystemC code:


```scss
#include <systemc.h>

void determinant(int n);

// This module takes an input array and provides the determinant
// input: a, an n x n array
// output: det, the determinant of the input array
sc_module("determinant") {
    sc_in <double> a[SIZE]; // input matrix
	double det; // output determinant

	// This function will calculate the determinant of the input matrix
	encrypt(int n) {
		double det = 1.0;

		// Initialize the input matrix
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
				a[i][j] = 0;
				sum[i][j] = 0;
				diff[i][j] = 0;
			}
		}

		// For each row of the matrix and for each coefficient in the row
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
				sum[i][j] = sum[i][j-1] + coeff[i][j];
				diff[i][j] = sum[i][j-1] - coeff[i][j];
			}
		}

		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			int pivot = i;
			for (int j = pivot; j < n; j++) {
				if (abs(coeff[i][j]) > abs(coeff[i][pivot])) {
					pivot = j;
				}
			}
			if (pivot != i) {
				swap(a[i], a[pivot]);
				det *= -1;
			}
			if (coeff[i][i] == 0) {
				return 0;
			}
			det *= coeff[i][i];
			for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
				double factor = coeff[j][i] / coeff[i][i];
				for (int k = i + 1; k < n; k++) {
					coeff[j][k] -= factor * coeff[i][k];
				}
			}
		}
		return det;
	}

	// run the algorithm on an input array
	void Determinant(int n) {
		double det;
		det = determinant(n);
		cout << "Determinant = " << det << endl
	}
}

int main() {
	// Example input
	int n = 4;
	double matrix[4][4] = {{1, 0, 2, -1},
						{3, 0, 0, 5},
						{2, 1, 4, -3},
						{1, 0, 5, 0}};

	Determinant(n);
	return 0;
}
```

The new module "Determinant" takes an array of doubles and performs matrix multiplication, followed by row reduction and column reduction to isolate any remaining elements. It returns the final result as a double variable. This is the equivalent of the provided C++/C code.
