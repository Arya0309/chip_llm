  Your task is to port C++ code to SystemC code?

The provided C++/C code consists of a single file that performs integer division. 

The `main()` function takes in two integers: Dividend and Divisor, and a few variables: Quotient, Remainder, and several error flags. The program now proceeds to check if Divisor is zero and warn the user if it is `out << "Error: Divisor cannot be zero." << endl;` Afterwards, it assigns the quotient to the Quotient variable by dividing the Dividend with the Divisor. 

The code then prints the Quotient and the Remainder to the screen. The C++ code uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output. 

The provided SystemC code derives from the same principles. SystemC is in its core a formal and precise model of hardware and computer systems, which means it maps device classes to real hardware and simulators that model the behavior of hardware. SystemC has additional features that make it ideal as a language for specifying hardware and software system design.

In SystemC, we start by defining a module called `divmod`. Inside this module, we define three input ports  `a, b` and one output port  `sum`. 

The module is declared in the header file.Next, we define the constructor, SC_CTOR(Adder), which takes two parameters, the first is the a, and the second is the b. The SC_CTOR of the module assigns system tasks to the module's member functions using the `sc_method` function call, in this case, ``void add()` is the Function we want to execute. Recall that in SystemC, sensitivity lists ensure that the `add()` method is triggered whenever the input ports change. Sensitivity lists are essential for efficiency and because they ensure only the necessary updates occur when the method is invoked. We use them to ensure that only the value of the input ports a and b when the update is triggered so as the add() method can rely only on those inputs; since we already know the value of the sum variable, the input to the add() method, we cannot rely on it when computing the sum. 

The inputs to the add method are a and b. Therefore, we define `void add()` using the inputs provided:

void add() {
sum.write(a.read() + b.read());
}

Finally, at the bottom of the file we instantiate an object of the divmod class. We also use the sc_start function to start the simulation. When sc_start is first called, SystemC calls the execute(void) method of the object. After this method calls set_sim_status(SC_STARTING) to signal the start of the simulation, the simulator sleeps until any of four events occurs, achieving $_see_below_. Sc_start calls this method repeatedly until the simulator receives a SC_STOP message. Apart from this initiation, the module does not have responsibility for order source or its relationship to the computer or to its partner devices. 

In a word, a programmable, reusable building manner replaces device-specific, prone to experiential derivation methods, making it more aditable for developers. Front-end plus back-end logical partitioning, a clear engineer's view of the structural hierarchy, interfaces designed to ensuring composability and reusability, component by component satising characteristics and interfaces, makes your code look like a glorified floor plan framework.
