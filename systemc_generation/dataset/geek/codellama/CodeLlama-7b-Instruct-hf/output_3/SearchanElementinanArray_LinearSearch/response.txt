  This is a task that challenges you to analyze C++/C code for understanding its inputs, outputs, and logic. The provided code implements the linear search algorithm iteratively. The function 'linearSearch' accepts two inputs, the vector to be searched and the key to search for. It iterates over the vector while comparing each element with the key and returns the index if the key is found. If the key is not found, the function returns -1.
To generate SystemC code, the vector input and key input must be captured in separate array ports. Also, the output must be linked to a separate integer output port. For example, the generated System C code might resemble the following:

// Linear search module
module Linear_search {
// Stack memory for temp
// Stack memory for input
// Output port for the search results
minst hard code = 0;

int main()
{
int i = 0;
int vector = 0;
int key = 0;

if value of memory at address_temp not equal t zero

for i = 0; i <= vector size; i++
{
if vector[i] not equal key
 {
 value of memory at address_temp = key size = value at address_temp + 1;
 }
}
}

return value at address_temp;
}
}
The linked list reverse module takes input from a pointer that stores the address of the first node. The first node is the head,the next element is tied to the head’s “next”  pointer, and so on. The module simply prints the linked list item by item to the console without modifying the list. In System C the linked list reverse module can be implemented as:

#include <systemc.h>

// Module that reverses a linked list
SC_MODULE(Reverser) {
    sc_in< Address> the head;  // Pointer to the first node
    sc_in< Address> next;    // Pointer to the next node
    sc_out< Address> current;  // Pointer to the current node

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Reverser) {
        current = head;
    }

    // Module body
    void trun() {
        // Print the current node data
        cout << current. read ()->d << endl;
        curent = curent.read ()->next;
    }
};
The execution of the module will start at the head of the linked list and iterate through the list until it reaches the end.

The program takes the user’s input and search each character in the array. It will print an error message if the character is not in the array. You can draw the outputs of the program using the `sc_out` object like this:

<!-- Embedded python code example -->

# using calibre

from colorlib.pygment import hml

hml.DTColor('#FFFFFF')  # white
hml.UTColor('#000000')  # black
hml. hrline('---', type='str')

# draw outputs of the program

img.append(draw. rectangle(Point(100, 120), 16, 16, arc=16))
img.append(draw.rectangle(Point(120, 120), 16, 16, arc=16))
img.append(draw.rectangle(Point(140, 120), 16, 16, arc=16))
img.append(draw.rectangle(Point(160, 120), 16, 16, arc=16))
img.append(draw.rectangle(Point(180, 120), 16, 16, arc=16))
img.append(draw.rectangle(Point(200, 120), 16, 16, arc=16))

img.append(draw.rectangle(Point(340, 120), 16, 16, arc=16))
img.append(draw.rectangle(Point(360, 120), 16, 16, arc=16))

library inherited;
has no type information inherited from the port signal MyPort1;
   MyPort1.din is connected to module1's rh;
   rh is connected to void's vector;
my var result01:
sysh.int;
sysh.string;
result01 := 0;
For PortPort1 with the variable type is sysh.int:

AtMyPort1  rh is results: resul ays.int;
Sysh. int rhc;
ArrayModem rh: resul ays.int;
port  target;
eport  sources: rhc ;
In the case of inheritance, if some name written
also in the caliber but inherited forward then sources
is the port name of the port that targets to be written by
the external program due tooudward name constructed in t
handle internal name.Eg.. : des obj hanle.

In both cases in synops eous tools that remain part of
System C tools this allowed type independent aliasing
(creating a copy with same behavior but with different
type for use of this copied alias) using roles for handles
and auto assembly of ports.Altogether these new features
enabled a simpler and more intuitive, and controlled
upgradability of design libraries in System C.
