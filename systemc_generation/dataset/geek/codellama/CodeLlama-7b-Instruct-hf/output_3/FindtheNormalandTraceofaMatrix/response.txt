**Summary of C++/C code**

The provided C++/C code is a program that computes the trace and normal of a given matrix. The code is written using C++11 features, including the `std::cout` output stream and the use of native arrays to store matrices. The program defines a `findTrace` function that takes a 2D array of integers as input and returns the trace of the matrix, which is the sum of its diagonal elements. The program also defines a `findNormal` function that takes a 2D array of integers as input and returns the normal of the matrix, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of its elements.

The main function of the program reads a 2D array of integers from the user and then computes the trace and normal of the matrix. The output is then printed to the console.

**Analysis of the code**

The code is written in C++11 and uses the `std::cout` output stream to print the values of the trace and normal to the console. The program relies on the `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions to compute these values. These functions take a 2D array of integers as input and return the trace and normal of the matrix as output.

The `findTrace` function is defined using a nested loop that iterates over each element of the matrix. The loop's inner loop iterates over each row and column, and the value of the current element is added to the sum. The loop's outer loop iterates over each row, and the sum is returned as the final trace value.

The `findNormal` function is defined in a similar way, but it returns the square root of the sum of the squares of the matrix elements instead.

**SystemC code**

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

int findTrace(int mat[MAX][MAX], int n) {
    int trace = 0;

    // Iterate over each element of the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            // If the current element is in the main diagonal, add it to the trace
            if (i == j) {
                trace += mat[i][j];
            }
        }
    }

    return trace;
}

int findNormal(int mat[MAX][MAX], int n) {
    int normal = 0;

    // Iterate over each element of the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            // Compute the square of the current element
            int element = mat[i][j];
            element *= element;

            // Add it to the normal
            normal += element;
        }
    }

    return sqrt(normal);
}

int main() {
    // Declare the matrix to hold the input data
    int mat[MAX][MAX];

    // Read the matrix from the console
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            std::cin >> mat[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Compute the trace and normal of the matrix
    int trace = findTrace(mat, n);
    int normal = findNormal(mat, n);

    // Print the results to the console
    std::cout << "Trace of matrix = " << trace << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Normal of matrix = " << normal << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
The SystemC code declares the `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions, which are identical to the C++/C functions. The `main` function is also identical, except that it uses `std::cin` and `std::cout` instead of `std::cout` and `std::cin`. Finally, the code relies on the `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals to receive and send data, just like the original C++/C code.
