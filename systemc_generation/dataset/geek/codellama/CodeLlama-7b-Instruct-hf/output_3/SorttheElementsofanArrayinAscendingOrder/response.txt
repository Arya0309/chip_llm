  This program takes an integer array as input. The program sorts the array using bubble sort. The program then prints the sorted array to the output.

The program has four major lines of code. The first line imports the <bits/stdc++.h> and <stdio.h> libraries. The second line uses namespace std. The third line declares the functions sort and swapNums. The final line starts the main function.

In the main function, the program declares an array nums with values {1, 12, 6, 8, 10}. The size of the array is calculated as the size of the array divided by the size of each element in the array. The program packages input and output variables using signals start and done. The final line starts the sorting process by invoking the sort function.

The sort function repeatedly checks if the maximum element needs to be swapped with the previous element by comparing the value at the index j with the value at the index j - 1. The isSwapped flag is used to determine if changes were made in the array during this process. If the swap occur, the isSwapped flag becomes true, otherwise, it remains false. If multiple swaps are made, the isSwapped flag will become true multiple times.  If the isSwap flag is false, the function breaks and ends.       A further for loop checks the array after each swap and updates the value of isSwap flag based on whether swaps occur.

At the end of the main function, the program prints the sorted value.

To replicate this behavior in SystemC, a module called Adder can be created. It takes two input integers, a and b, as well as an output variable, sum. The sum variable will be used to store the output of the module. In the SystemsC code, the module can be constructed using two input ports and one output port. The module's process, which is responsible for transforming input to output, processes the module's input ports once current value becomes valid. In the process, the module performs the addition operation on the two input values a and b, and the output sum value is updated.  In the end, the compiled SystemC code can be integrated with testbenches to automate the simulation. The output of the SystemC module will give same signals as the SystemC code shows.
