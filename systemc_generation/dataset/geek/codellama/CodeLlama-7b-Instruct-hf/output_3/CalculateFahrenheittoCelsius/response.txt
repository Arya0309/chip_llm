  C++ Code: Converts Fahrenheit scale to Celsius scale

Inputs: float fahrenheit

Outputs: float celsius

Function: This program converts a Fahrenheit temperature to its Celsius equivalent.

Line Spoken Explanation:

Line 1: Includes the header file to utilize std and provides a namespace for the code. It is a standard C++ header file with many functions included.

Line 2, 3: Utilizes the identifier std and sets the namespace to std. This line is used when working in the mathematical libraries of C++.

Line 4: Declares the function Conversion as a return value of float type. This function will receive and transform a float input for temperature conversion.

Line 5: Declares an int n, which represents temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. This is inputted from the main program.

Line 6: Statically types the function Conversion's single input and output value at the method level. It takes in the value of n.

Line 7-9: Calculates temperature in Celsius by multiplying the difference between Celsius and Fahrenheit by the temperature in degrees.

Line 10: Conversion(n) returns its loat valueto the main program where it is set in a variables called "cout".

Line 11: Statically types the int n as a function parameter in the main program. This is where temperature is inputted from the keyboard.

Line 12-14: Outputs temperature in Celsius.

Driver code:

Output: 471.4

In the output shown, the temperature 40 degrees Fahrenheit has been inputted, and it has been converted into its Celsius equivalent, which is 471.4 degrees Celsius.


Convert to Systemc Code:

> **Note** that SystemC code uses ports and Modules for inputs and outputs, and the signal names for the input and output ports in this example are: `sc_in<float> fahrenheit;`, and `sc_out<float> celsius;`. You must utilize these signals to ensure seamless integration with the testbench.

```
SC_MODULE (TempConversion) {
    // Temperature conversion inputs
    sc_in <float> fahrenheit;

    // Converted temperature output
    sc_out <float> celsius;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR (TempConversion) {
        // Perform temperature conversion
        SC_METHOD (conversion);
        sensitive << fahrenheit;
    }

    // Convert fahrenheit to celsius
    void conversion() {
        // Get fahrenheit temperature
        float fahrenheit_temp = fahrenheit.read();

        // Convert to celsius
        float celsius_temp = (fahrenheit_temp - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0;

        // Set converted temperature in output port
        celsius.write(celsius_temp);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create simulation signal
    sc_signal <float> simulation_signal;

    // Calculate temperature conversion
    TempConversion tempConversion(simulation_signal);

    // Run simulation
    sc_start();

    // Print resulting temperature
    cout << "Temperature conversion: " << simulation_signal.read() << endl;

    // Exit simulation
    return 0;
}
```

In this system, temperature conversion is defined as a module that tests two inputs, fahrenheit and celsius, where the output is displayed. The temperature conversion formula in the C++ code is implemented in unit tests.

On the other hand, the conversion input is a Dynamic Time Wire (DTW) port in SystemC. A SystemC DTW is a behavior that provides output stimulus to a module. It contains one or more ports that are driven by the model for analysis.

This temperature conversion function is implemented in a SystemC module that takes one temperature input and performs the calculation appropriate for the output. The created cable is a SystemC method (SC_METHOD) that contains three behaviors.

* There is a Black box to perform temperature conversion based on inputed value.
* The signal is read out through a data ready function.
* The temperature value is written to a provided output port.
