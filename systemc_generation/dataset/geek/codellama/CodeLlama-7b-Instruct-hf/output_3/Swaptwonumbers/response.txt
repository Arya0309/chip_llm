  As an answer, we can:

1. Read and thoroughly analyze the provided C++/C code.
2. Recognize the inputs and outputs from the code: The inputs are a and b, and the output is the out_a and out_b values.
3. Provide a detailed, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language summary of the provided code, describing:
	a. The inputs and outputs of the code.
	b. Each major line or block of code and its functionality (e.g., inputs, outputs, temporary variables, swapping algorithms).
4. Finally, based on the analysis, generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.

> Inputs:

a) and b) are the inputs to the program to be swapped in the program

> Outputs:

out_a and out_b are the outputs to the program to be swapped.

> The main code block:

The main code block contains a variety of functions that help swap the inputs provided a and b with outputs out_a and out_b.
The a and b inputs stored in main. These values are later given to out_a and out_b. 
Inspecting line six of the code below is important, as it shows how the values in a and b will be given to out_a and out_b, respectively.
The output of the code in line six means that if out_a becomes 100, a must become 50; and if out_b becomes 100,b must become 50.

> Line 6 of Main Code Block


* temp stores the value at a and b.
* temp is equal to a.
* a is equal to b.
* b is equal to temp.

This enables two numbers to be swapped like they are before and after a program has run. 

> Generated SystemC code: 

In this code, the inputs of the program must be a and b. The program must also declare outputs. The inputs of the program are stored in variables denoted by temp1 and temp2.
void sc_main(){
 declare(a,b,out_a,out_b):
        // temporary variable
 temp1=a;
        a=b;
        b=temp1;
cout<< "After swapping a = " << a << " , b = " << b
        << endl;
}

This code should be copy-pasted into a sc file to run a System C simulator.
Written in the same syntax used in C++, this high-level description explains how the code works. 
It also includes any bit of information necessary for a synthesiser to write the correct code.
