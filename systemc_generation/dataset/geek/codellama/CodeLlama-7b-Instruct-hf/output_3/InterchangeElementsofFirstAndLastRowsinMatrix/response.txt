  The provided C++/C code is a simple program that swaps the elements of the first and last columns of a 2D array. The program reads a 2D array of integers, `m`, of size `n x n`, where `n` is a constant defined as `4` in the code. It then swaps the elements of the first and last columns, and then prints the interchanged array.

The inputs to the program are the elements of the 2D array `m`, which are of type int and are being read into the array. The output of the program is the interchanged array.

There are several major lines or blocks of code in the program:

1. The `interchangeFirstLast` function takes a 2D array of integers `m` and a constant `n`, and it swaps the elements of the first and last columns. The function uses a loop to iterate over each row of the array, and it swaps the elements of the first and last columns using a temporary variable, `t`.
2. The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It initializes a 2D array `m` of integers of size `n x n`, and it reads a 2D array of integers values from standard input. It then calls the `interchangeFirstLast` function to swap the elements of the first and last columns, and then it prints the interchanged array to standard output.
3. The `add` method of the `Adder` module in the SystemC code is a process that adds two integers `a` and `b` and produces their sum.

The provided SystemC code is a module that wraps the `Adder` module and adds two integers. The module takes two input ports, `a` and `b`, and it produces an output port, `sum`, which holds the sum of the two inputs. The module uses a process to perform the addition.

To convert the C++/C code to a SystemC code, the following steps can be taken:

1. Identify the inputs and outputs of the C++/C code. In this case, the inputs are the elements of the 2D array `m`, and the output is the interchanged array.
2. Identify the major lines or blocks of code in the C++/C code, and generate a description of each one. In this case, the `interchangeFirstLast` function swaps the elements of the first and last columns, and the `main` function reads a 2D array of integers value from standard input and prints the interchanged array to standard output. The `add` method of the `Adder` module in the SystemC code performs the actual addition.
3. Generate a SystemC code that faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source. In this case, the SystemC code could look like the following:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that swaps the elements of the first 
// and last columns of a 2D array
SC_MODULE(Swapper) {
    // Input and output ports
    sc_in<int> in[SIZE];
    sc_out<int> out[SIZE];

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Swapper) {
        // Process to swap the elements of the
        // first and last columns
        SC_METHOD(swap);
        sensitive << in;
    }

    // Method to swap the elements of the first 
    // and last columns
    void swap() {
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            int t = in[i][0];
            in[i][0] = in[i][SIZE - 1];
            in[i][SIZE - 1] = t;
        }
        out = in;
    }
};
```
This SystemC code defines a module, `Swapper`, that takes a 2D array of integers, `in`, as input and produces a 2D array of integers, `out`, as output. The module uses a process to swap the elements of the first and last columns of the input array, and it then assigns the output array `out` to be the input array `in`.

In order to integrate the SystemC code with our existing testbench, we would need to add input and output signals to the module, as defined above, so that the testbench can drive the input array and read the output array. We could then feed the input array into the `in` signal, run the simulation, and read the output array from the `out` signal.
