  Task #1:

Analyze the C++/C code to determine the inputs and outputs.
Input(s): It can read any positive integer from the input.
Output(s): It can write a binary representation, in our case, a binary number, from the input.

Task #2:

Provide a detailed, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language summary for buffer code.
The function int decToBinary(int n) as an undecorated number takes a positive integer n as input and distribute the remainder after division by an integer two from which the binary number is generated. The result is stored in an array, binaryNum. This array is printed in reverse order. This function prints one binary number.
The driver code scans variable n with the integer 10 and calls decToBinary with that value.

Task #3:

(Ensure that the SystemC code you provide faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source.)
SystemC code:
// Convert non-zero decimal to binary
static void decToBinary(int n, sc_out<int>& binary_out, output& out)
{
	// Array to store binary number
	int binary_numbers[32];

	// Counter for binary array
	int i = 0;
	while (n != 0)
	{
		// Storing remainder in binary
		// array
		binary_numbers[i] = n % 2;
		n = n / 2;
		i++;
	}

	// Printing binary array in reverse
	// order
	for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
		out.println(binary_numbers[j]);
}

// C++ program to convert a decimal number to binary
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Driver code
int main()
{
	sc_out<int> dec_in;
	sc_In<int> binary_out;

	int n = 10;
	decToBinary(n, binary_out, dec_In);

	return 0;
}
