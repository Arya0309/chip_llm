  This C++/C program is designed to determine whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. Following the documentation provided, the number is given as a command line argument and then converted into a boolean condition indicating whether or not it is an Armstrong number.

The first block of code given is a declaration of variables: 'n' is the original input number provided, and 'p' is the same number represented in reverse. 't' is assigned to the inputs throughout the program.

The program then goes through and calculates the sum of the digits of 'n'. At each step, it removes the last digit from 'n' and adds it to 'p', squaring that number to fit the original input requirements.*

Once the digits have been calculated, the program compares the result 'p' to 't'; if they match, they print a sentence indicating 'Yes, it is an Armstrong number.' Otherwise, it prints a sentence explaining 'It is not an Armstrong number.' That's it!

using Systemc { // Include the Systemc library in your code.
int cxout;   // Declare variables for the system:
bool cxin; cxout; cximport std; // Declare variables for the system:
Sc_in<cxin> sc_out<cxout> int main(); { cxint num_in; // Input variables for the system:

    int n = cx; // Input variables for the system:

int p = 0; // Variables to be added to the system:

// Main functionality for the system:
while (n > 0) { // While the product value is valid, ensuring that the required quantity is still greater than zero:
int rem = n % 10; // Capture the least significant digit from the quantity and ensure that it is in the multiple of a ten:
p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem); // Calculate the final product by squaring the value;
n = n / 10; // Remove the last digit of the product and ensure the remaining number can be correct product: n = n.version }} // Imports the information and convert int to cout:

// Sample int main () { // Replace main() with this:
std::cout cxout << "Armstrong number ?:"; // Output bool indicators to the consumer:
cin >> cxin; // Assign bool output usbypublish system: 
sc cxin; bool cxactive => cxout; cx armstrongTest = cxactive; // Declare input ports:

cxint NumberToTest = cx_in; Num = NumberToTest; // Input the number being tested:
int temp = Num; // Store the number as a temporary variable for future use:
int P = 0; // Initialize (p) as a product variable of 0:

// At this point in the code, the system calculates the product of the digits of num. Based on the documentation above, it has been established that (p) will be equal to (sum).
    sc_signal<bool> sum;  // Define the variable(s) sum to hold the value of (sum):
    bool p; // Define the variable(s) p to hold the value of (p) in the remainder of the code:

    while (Num > 0) { // While the number [Num] has not been reached, calculate the sum of the digits of [Num] by taking the cubed power of each digit while ensuring that it is negative and a multiple of ten:
        int rem = Num % 10;   // Variable to hold the last digit:
        int pow = pow(rem, 3);   // Variable to hold the power value:
        P = (P) + pow;  // Add the product of the remainder by cubing [rem] to ??equal the sum of digits:
        Num = (Num) / 10; // Gather the middle digit while ensuring that the new [Num] is negative and a multiple of ten:
    }

// Conditioning statements for our system to output the relevant message
    sum = P sum), // Operate on the [sum] variable and affect our message based on whether the product is equivalent to the given [sum] it [p] is equivalent to the [p]:

    if (ArmstrongNumBoolResult) { // Conditional statement:
        std::cout << "Yes. Is an Armstrong number." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "No. Not an Armstrong number." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

The final version of the code has been modified and incorporates the same functionality as the original code. It has been modified to include the necessary variables for use with Systemc. This version can be imported into a VCS flow for the synthesis of a hardware module that will generate the same desired functionality as the original C++/C version.
