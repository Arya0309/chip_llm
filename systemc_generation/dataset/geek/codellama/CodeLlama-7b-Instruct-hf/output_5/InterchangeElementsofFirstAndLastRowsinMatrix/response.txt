  The provided C++/C code defines a function `interchangeFirstLast` that swaps the elements of the first and last columns of a 2D array. The function takes an array `m` of size `n x n` as input and returns the swapped array.

The first step toward creating an equivalent SystemC code is to identify the inputs and outputs of the original C++/C code. The input to the function is a 2D array `m` of size `n x n`, and the output is also a 2D array `m` of size `n x n`.

The next step is to analyze the code line by line and provide a natural language explanation of each line.

Here is a line-by-line explanation of the provided C++/C code:

```
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 

#define n 4 

void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n]) 
{ 
	// swapping of element between first 
	// and last columns 
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
	{ 
		int t = m[i][0]; 
		m[i][0] = m[i][n - 1]; 
		m[i][n - 1] = t; 
	} 
} 
```

In this line, the standard input/output library stdio.h (`#include <iostream>`) is included. The `using namespace std;` statement allows the C++ compiler to refer to the `std` namespace without the need to specify std before every function call.

The next line defines a macro `n` to be equal to 4. This macro is used to define the size of the 2D array `m`.

The `interchangeFirstLast` function is defined, which takes a 2D array `m` of size `n x n` as an input and returns the swapped array.

Within the function, the for loop iterates over the rows of the array and interchanges the elements of the first and last columns. The first element of each row is stored in `t`, and the last element of each row is stored in `m[i][0]`. The resulting swapped array is then returned.

The last line of the provided C++/C code is the `main` function, which takes an input array `m` of size `n x n` from the user and displays the swapped array.

Now, let's create an equivalent SystemC code snippet that faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source. Here is the SystemC code:
```
#include <systemc>

// Input and output signals
sc_in<int> in[n];
sc_out<int> out[n];

// Function to swap first and last columns
void swapFirstLast(int m[][n]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int t = m[i][0];
        m[i][0] = m[i][n-1];
        m[i][n-1] = t;
    }
}

// Driver function
void main() {
    int m[n][n];
    sc_in<int> in[n];
    sc_out<int> out[n];

    // Read input from user
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            m[i][j] = in[i][j].read();
        }
    }

    // Call swapFirstLast function
    swapFirstLast(m);

    // Write output to user
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            out[i][j].write(m[i][j]);
        }
    }
}
```
In this SystemC code snippet, we define input signals `in[n]` and output signals `out[n]` to match the inputs and outputs of the original C++/C code. We then define a function `swapFirstLast` that takes a 2D array `m` of size `n x n` as an input and returns the swapped array.

Within the `main` function, we read input from the user by calling the `in` signals and store the input elements in the `m` array. We then call the `swapFirstLast` function to swap the first and last columns of the array. Finally, we write the output to the user by calling the `out` signals and storing the resulting swapped array.

Note that we utilize the `sc_in<int> in[n];` and `sc_out<int> out[n];` signals defined at the top of the code to ensure seamless integration with our existing testbench.
