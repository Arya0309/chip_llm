  Based on the provided C++/C code, we have a C++ program that takes a user input, checks if it is an Armstrong number or not, and then prints whether it is an Armstrong number or not.
```cpp
// C++ program to implement the above approach
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int n = 153;
	int temp = n;
	int p = 0;

	// Function to calculate
	// the sum of individual digits
	while (n > 0) {
		int rem = n % 10;
		p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
		n = n / 10;
	}

	// Condition to check whether
	// the value of P equals
	// to user input or not.
	if (temp == p) {
		cout << ("Yes. It is Armstrong No.");
	}
	else {
		cout << ("No. It is not an Armstrong No.");
	}
	return 0;
}

```
The inputs to this code are the input and output variables, which are integers in C, and pointers to the integers in C++. 

The output is a single character string: "Yes", "No", "It is Armstrong No", or "It is not an Armstrong No"

The functional elements of the code are as follows:
1. The `int main ` function is the program's entry point.
2. The computation begins with variable `int p = 0=`
3. The main loop begins by taking theÊºlast digit of the integer ` currently in ` and placing it into a variable `rem`.
4. The value of rem is given the exponent is given 3, and then squared twice, and then placed into a variable;
5. The loop continues by dividing `n` by 10 and replacing `n` with its result until there is no more processing left to do, at which point the loop exits.
6. The program then checks the condition that the value of P equals to the input variable, temp, if the conditions are true, the number is Armstrong, then it prints that the user's input is an Armstrong number.

The code can be translated to SystemC code as follows:
```cpp
//SystemC code:
#include <systemc.h>
int p = 0;
int n = 153;
temp = n;

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> rem; // Output port for the remainder

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to add the two numbers
    void add() {
        int rem = a.read() % 10;
        p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
        n = n / 10;
    }
};


int main(){
   
    sc_in<int>num_in = 153; // user input
    Adder adder(sc_module_name("adder")); //create a adder module and hook it into the input and output of the system
    sc_out< bool> is_armstrong = adder.read(sc_module_name("adder"), is_armstrong);
 
    

}

```
This code imports the standard I/Os.
It sets the outputs and inputs as per the values provided in the code.
It uses a module `Adder`, which is an input to the code.
This module uses the arithmetic operation `+`, `%`, and `/`, which must be derived or declared within the `Adder` scope.
Finally, it creates a `counter` module that takes in the initial value of the loop counter and outputs it as the square sum of the `first` variable and stores it in the `p` variable. In the next loop iteration, it resets the loop counter to zero.

Overall, the code captures the fundamental arithmetic operators, logical operators, and uses the loop construct to compute the sum of the individual digits of a number.
In SystemC, the addition and division operators must be defined or allocated within the module also.
Remember that these are integral, fixed-size datatypes in C++. To fix this, you will need to declare a seperate variable/ varadic variable for the summation operation of all the digits before dividing it by 10 so that the remainder operator becomes the remaining digit
