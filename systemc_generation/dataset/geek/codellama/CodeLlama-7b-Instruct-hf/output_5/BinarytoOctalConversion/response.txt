  Input(s): The input to the function 'octalToDecimal' is an octal value stored in an integer type variable named 'n' that represents the octal number to be converted. Output(s): The output is the decimal equivalent of the octal value stored in the integer variable 'n'. An integer type variable named 'decimal_output' stores the output of the function.

Line-by-line or block-by-block natural language summary: The function 'octalToDecimal' is used to convert an octal number represented by an integer variable named 'n' into its corresponding decimal equivalent. The function uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of the octal number, multiply that digit by the appropriate base value of 8 to convert to decimal, and add the result to the total decimal value being computed. In the end, the total decimal value is returned as the output of the function. The function is called in the main() method of the driver code.

SystemC code equivalent:

```
void octalToDecimal(int n) {
    int num = n;
    int dec_value = 0;
    int base = 1;
    int temp = num;
    while (temp) {
        int last_digit = temp%10;
        temp = temp/10;
        dec_value += last_digit * base;
        base = base * 8;
    }
    return dec_value;
}

sc_module(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> octal_input;
    sc_out<int> decimal_output;
    void add() {
        decimal_output.write(octal_input.read() * log(8));
    }
};
```

The SystemC code generates an equivalent of the C++/C code using SystemC primitives, including sc_in and sc_out ports to represent the input and output values, a process for converting the octal number to its decimal equivalent, and a method to perform the conversion and write the output value to the decimal_output port. The log function is used to multiply each digit of the binary number by its power of 8 and add them up.
