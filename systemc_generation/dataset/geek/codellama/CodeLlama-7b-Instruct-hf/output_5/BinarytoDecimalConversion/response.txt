  As requested, here is an analysis and summary of the provided C++/C code, as well as an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic.

**Inputs and Outputs**

The C++/C code takes in a binary number as an integer input (represented by the variable `num`) and outputs the corresponding decimal number (represented by the variable `dec_value`).

**Line-by-Line Explanation**

Here is a line-by-line explanation of the C++/C code:
```
// Initializing base value to 1, i.e. 2^0.
int base = 1; 

// Initializing the decimal value to 0.
int dec_value = 0; 

// Initializing the temporary variable to the input number.
int temp = num; 

// Loop to convert binary to decimal.
while (temp) { 
    // Get the last digit of the binary number.
    int last_digit = temp % 10; 
    // Divide the binary number by 10.
    temp = temp / 10; 
    // Multiply the last digit by the base value.
    dec_value = dec_value + last_digit * base; 
    // Update the base value with the product of the base and 2.
    base = base * 2; 
} 

// Return the decimal value.
return dec_value; 
```
In this section of code, the `base` variable is initialized to 1, which represents the power of 2 equal to 2^0. The `dec_value` variable is then initialized to 0, which means that the initial decimal value will be 0. The `temp` variable is then initialized to the input number, which is stored in the `num` variable.

The `while` loop then begins, and the `last_digit` variable is assigned the last digit of the binary number by taking the remainder of `temp` divided by 10. The `temp` variable is then divided by 10 to remove the last digit of the binary number. The `dec_value` variable is then updated by multiplying the `last_digit` by the `base` value and adding it to the `dec_value`. Finally, the `base` value is updated with the product of the `base` value multiplied by 2.

The loop continues until the `temp` variable is 0, indicating that the binary number has been converted to its decimal equivalent. The final value of the `dec_value` variable is returned as the output.

**Block-by-Block Explanation**

Here is a block-by-block explanation of the C++/C code:

**1. Variables Initialization**

In this block of code, the `base` variable is initialized to 1, and the `dec_value` variable is initialized to 0. These variables will be used to keep track of the current base value and the decimal value, respectively.

**2. Decimal Value Calculation**

In this block of code, the value of the `dec_value` variable is calculated based on the input binary number. The `temp` variable is initialized to the input number, and a `while` loop is used to iterate over each digit of the binary number.

**3. While Loop**

Inside the `while` loop, the `last_digit` variable is assigned the last digit of the binary number by taking the remainder of `temp` divided by 10. The `temp` variable is then divided by 10 to remove the last digit of the binary number. The `dec_value` variable is then updated by multiplying the `last_digit` by the `base` value and adding it to the `dec_value`. Finally, the `base` value is updated with the product of the `base` value multiplied by 2.

The loop continues until the `temp` variable is 0, indicating that the binary number has been converted to its decimal equivalent. The final value of the `dec_value` variable is returned as the output.

**Equivalent SystemC Code**

Here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(BinaryToDecimal) {
  // Declare the input and output ports.
  sc_in<int> binary_in; 
  sc_out<int> decimal_out;

  // Declare the base value and decimal value variables.
  int base = 1; 
  int dec_value = 0;

  // Declare the temporary variable for the binary number.
  int temp;

  // Create a method to perform the binary to decimal conversion.
  void binary_to_decimal();

  // Constructor
  SC_CTOR(BinaryToDecimal) {
    // Bind the method to the binary_to_decimal_out port.
    SC_METHOD(binary_to_decimal)
      sensitive << binary_in;
    }

  void binary_to_decimal() {
    // If the binary input is 0, return 0.
    if (binary_in == 0) {
      decimal_out.write(0);
      return;
    }

    // Initialize the temp variable to the binary input.
    temp = binary_in;

    // Create a while loop to iterate over the binary input.
    while (temp != 0) {
      // Get the last digit of the binary input.
      int last_digit = temp % 10;
      // Remove the last digit from the binary input.
      temp = temp / 10;
      // Update the decimal value with the last digit multiplied by the base value.
      dec_value = dec_value + last_digit * base;
      // Update the base value with the product of the base value multiplied by 2.
      base = base * 2;
    }

    // Return the decimal value.
    decimal_out.write(dec_value);
  }
};
```
This is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source. The `BinaryToDecimal` module is created, with an input and output port for the binary and decimal numbers, respectively. A `base` variable is declared to keep track of the current base value, and a `dec_value` variable is declared to keep track of the current decimal value.

The `binary_to_decimal` method is created to perform the binary to decimal conversion, which is called by the `SC_METHOD` construct. If the binary input is 0, return 0. The `temp` variable is then initialized to the binary input, and a `while` loop is used to iterate over each digit of the binary number. The `last_digit` variable is assigned the last digit of the binary number by taking the remainder of `temp` divided by 10. The `temp` variable is then divided by 10 to remove the last digit of the binary number. The `dec_value` variable is then updated by multiplying the `last_digit` by the `base` value and adding it to the `dec_value`. Finally, the `base` value is updated with the product of the `base` value multiplied by 2.

The loop continues until the `temp` variable is 0, indicating that the binary number has been converted to its decimal equivalent. The final value of the `dec_value` variable is returned as the output.
