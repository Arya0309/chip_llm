  Sure, here's the analysis and pseudo-SystemC code for the given C++/C source code.

---

**Inputs and Outputs:**

Inputs:

* P: principal amount (float)
* R: rate of interest (float)
* T: time (float)

Outputs:

* SI: simple interest (float)

---

**Summary:**

The provided C++/C source code calculates the simple interest for a given principal amount, time, and rate of interest. The code works as follows:

1. It reads the principal amount (P), rate of interest (R), and time (T) from the command-line input.
2. It calculates the simple interest by multiplying the principal amount by the time and the rate of interest, and then dividing by 100.
3. It prints the simple interest to the command-line output.

**SystemC Code:**

Here's the pseudo-SystemC code that captures the same logic as the original C++/C source code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module for simple interest calculation
SC_MODULE(SimpleInterest) {
    sc_in<float> P; // Input port for principal amount
    sc_in<float> R; // Input port for rate of interest
    sc_in<float> T; // Input port for time
    sc_out<float> SI; // Output port for simple interest

    // Method to calculate the simple interest
    void calculateSimpleInterest() {
        SI.write((P * T * R) / 100);
    }

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SimpleInterest) {
        // Call the calculateSimpleInterest method when both P, R, and T inputs have changed
        SC_METHOD(calculateSimpleInterest);
        sensitive << P << R << T;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `SimpleInterest` module has three input ports (P, R, and T) and one output port (SI). The `calculateSimpleInterest()` method calculates the simple interest by multiplying the principal amount by the time and the rate of interest, and then dividing by 100. The `SC_METHOD(calculateSimpleInterest)` statement tells SystemC that the `calculateSimpleInterest()` method should be called when any of the input ports (P, R, or T) changes. The `sensitive` statement ensures that SystemC will only call the `calculateSimpleInterest()` method when all of the input ports (P, R, and T) have been updated.

In the SystemC code above, I have utilized the `sc_in` and `sc_out` variables that you provided to connect the input and output ports.
