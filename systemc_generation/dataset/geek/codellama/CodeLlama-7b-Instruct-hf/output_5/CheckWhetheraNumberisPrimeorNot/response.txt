  **Inputs and Outputs**:

1. Inputs:
	* n: integer number to be checked for primality
2. Outputs:
	* is_prime: boolean value indicating whether n is prime or not prime

**Detailed Explanation**:

The provided C++/C code uses the simple trial division method to check if a number is prime. The program starts by reading in a positive integer number n from the user. It then initializes a variable cnt to 0, which will be used to keep track of how many numbers n is divisible by.

The program then checks if n is less than or equal to 1, and if so, prints "n is NOT prime" to the console. If n is greater than 1, it proceeds to check if n is divisible by any number between 1 and n. It does this by using a for loop that iterates from 1 to n, and for each iteration, checks if n is divisible by the current number i. If n is divisible by i, the variable cnt is incremented.

After the for loop finishes, the program checks if the variable cnt is greater than 2. If so, it prints "n is NOT prime" to the console. If cnt is less than or equal to 2, it means that n is prime. The program then prints "n is prime" to the console.

In SystemC, we can implement the same logic using the following code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks for primality using simple trial division
SC_MODULE(PrimeNumberChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n; // Input port for the number to be checked
    sc_out<bool> is_prime; // Output port for the result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(PrimeNumberChecker) {
        // Process to check for primality
        SC_METHOD(check_prime);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to check if n is prime
    void check_prime() {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        if (cnt > 2) {
            is_prime.write(false);
        } else {
            is_prime.write(true);
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC implementation, we use a single process (called check_prime()) to check if the input number n is prime. The process first initializes a variable cnt to 0, which will keep track of how many numbers n is divisible by. It then uses a for loop to check if n is divisible by any number between 1 and n. If n is divisible by i, the variable cnt is incremented. After the loop finishes, the process checks if cnt is greater than 2, and if so, sets the output is_prime to false. If cnt is less than or equal to 2, it sets is_prime to true.

The process is triggered when the input n changes value, so it can be called repeatedly to check if different numbers are prime. The output is_prime is set in each invocation, so the client can check if the last input was a prime number or not.

In the provided SystemC code snippet, we have incorporated the input/output signals provided by the problem statement. The input n is used as the argument to the constructor, and the output is_prime is set in the check_prime() method. The code is written in a way that uses the SystemC library to generate a synthesizable RTL for the design.
