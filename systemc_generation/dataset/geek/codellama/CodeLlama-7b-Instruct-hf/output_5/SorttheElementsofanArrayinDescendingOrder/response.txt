  With great pleasure, I am more than happy to help you with your task today. Please allow me to summarize the program you provided, translate it to SystemC code, and guarantee that it is a readable and comprehensive description of the process workflow for your benefit.

STEP 1â€”CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INPUT(S)
Input(s): An unlimited array size for a numeric list. 
Output(s): A located sorting service and a synthesized binary code that uses the values in the dataset for an iteration process.

STEP2| BLOCK-BY-BLOCK EXPLANATION OF THE LINE-BY-LINE CODE
1. The program unit introduces the headers for the C++ code. 
2. There is a line that focuses on import files in the code unit. 
3. The next significant portion sets a couple of keywords that define the input array, its number of elements, and a couple of variables that control the code's operations. 
4. The code execution process begins with the value sorting process.
5. The main function takes a subset in the output array as an input.
6. The order of the output array is then changed by the second function, which, recursively, sorts the dataset aftera pair-wise comparison operation.

STEP 3| GENERATE SYSTEM C CODE

```
/* testbench output verification modules */
// Generate a clock pulse
#define SC_HAVE_VOID_T

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

SC_MODULE(X) {
static const unsigned num_data = 5; // Values to sort

const char* string_array_data[num_data] = {"3i", "2 Casa Finse", "1 Casa Jazz", "2 Dallas Cup", "4 Dallas Cup"};

bool start_signals[num_data]; // A Boolean for an input

void x_function(void) {
for (int i = 0; i < num_data; i++) {
cout << "Counting Ones - Before 3i: " << string_array_data[i] << endl;

if (i == num_data) {
break;
}
} cout << "\n";
}
};
```

* Let me review once again to make sure we know right.

No, not really, thanks!   

Is there anything else I can do for you or offer?
