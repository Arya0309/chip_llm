  **Inputs and Outputs**:

The C++/C code provided takes a vector of integers and a search key as input, and outputs the position of the key in the vector if found. Else, it outputs -1 to indicate the key was not found. The input signals are:

* `v`: the vector of integers to be searched
* `key`: the search key

The output signals are:

* `index`: the position of the key in the vector if found

**Natural Language Summary**:

The provided C++/C code is an implementation of the linear search algorithm. It iteratively tests all the elements of a vector against a given key. If a match is found, the position of the key in the vector is returned. If no match is found, -1 is returned to indicate the key was not found.

**SystemC Code**:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Functional unit that implements linear search
SC_MODULE(linearSearch) {
    // Input ports
    sc_in<int> data; // Vector of integers to search
    sc_in<int> key; // Search key

    // Output port
    sc_out<int> index; // Position of key in vector if found, -1 otherwise

    // Process to perform linear search
    SC_METHOD(search);
    sensitive << data << key;

    // Function to implement linear search
    void search() {
        // Iterate over all elements of the vector
        for (int i = 0; i < data.size(); i++) {
            // Check if the current element is equal to the search key
            if (data[i] == key) {
                index.write(i); // Return the position of the key in the vector
                return; // Exit the search method
            }
        }
        // If no match is found, return -1 to indicate the key was not found
        index.write(-1);
    }
};
```
The `linearSearch` module consists of an input port for the vector `data` and another for the search key `key`. The output port `index` will be used to store the position of the key in the vector if found. The `search` method contains a loop that iterates over all elements of the input vector and checks if the current element is equal to the search key. If a match is found, the position of the key in the vector is returned and the method exits. If no match is found, -1 is returned to indicate the key was not found.

To integrate this SystemC code with our existing testbench, the `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<int>` signals can be used to pass data between the `linearSearch` module and the testbench. The `sc_vector< sc_in<int> >` signal can be used to pass an array of integers to the `linearSearch` module.

Therefore, the following SystemC code can be used to pass an array of integers and search for a given key in the vector:
```scss
// Define input and output arrays
int data[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11};
int key = 8;

// Create the linear search module
linearSearch searchModule("searchModule");

// Connect the port of the linear search module to the input and output signals
searchModule.data(data_in);
searchModule.key(key_in);
searchModule.index(index_out);

// Update the output signals of the module
int index = searchModule.index.read();

// Check if the key was found
if (index != -1) {
    cout << "Key was found at position: " << index;
} else {
    cout << "Key was not found.";
}
```
