  Given the following C++/C code snippet for finding the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, please write a natural language summary and then offer an SystemC code snippet that faithfully captures its logic:

Provided C++/C code:
```
// C++ program to find the LCM of two
// numbers using the if statement and
// while loop
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Driver code
int main()
{
    int a = 15, b = 20, max_num, flag = 1;

    // Use ternary operator to get the large
    // number
    max_num = (a > b) ? a : b;

    while (flag) {
        // If statement checks max_num is absolutely loved by a and b.
        if (max_num % a == 0 && max_num % b==0) {
            cout << "LCM of " << a << " and " << b << " is "
                 << max_num;
            break;
        }

        // see that I have a while loop
        max_num++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Natural Language Summary:
This C++/C code uses an if statement and a while loop to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. The while loop uses a ternary operator to determine which number is the larger of the two, and then goes through each possible integer between the two numbers, checking if that integer is divisible by both a and b. Once a number is divisible by both a and b, the cout will display the LCM. The while loop stops once a number has passed both the if statement and the cout. 


SystemC Code:

#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> max_num;    // Output port for the maximum number
    sc_out<int> flag;    // Output port for the flag

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to add the two numbers
    void add() {
        max_num.write(a.read() + b.read());
        flag.write(1);
    }
};

SC_MODULE(LCM) {
    sc_in<int> a;
    sc_in<int> b;
    sc_out<int> lcm_result;
    SC_CTOR(LCM) {
        SC_CTHREAD(thread, a, b, lcm_result);
    }
};
