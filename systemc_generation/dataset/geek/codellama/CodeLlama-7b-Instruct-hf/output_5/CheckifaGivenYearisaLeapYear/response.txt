  The provided C++/C program defines a function `checkYear` to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not. The function uses logical operators to evaluate whether the year is divisible by 4, 100, or 400, and returns true if the year is a leap year, and false otherwise.

---

Inputs and Outputs:

1. Input: An integer representing a year.
2. Output: A boolean indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.

Line-by-Line Explanation:

The `bool checkYear(int year)` function begins by checking if the year is a leap year if it is divisible by 400. If it is, it returns true and the function ends. Otherwise, the function checks if the year is not a leap year if it is divisible by 100, but not divisible by 400. If this is the case, the function returns false and ends.

Next, the function checks if the year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100. If this is the case, the function returns true and ends. Finally, if none of the other conditions are met, the function returns false and ends.

The main function begins by assigning an integer value of 2000 to the variable `year`. It then checks if the year is a leap year using the `checkYear` function and conditionally writes either "Leap Year" or "Not a Leap Year" to the console based on the return value of the function.

SystemC Code:

```c
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
	sc_in<int> year;
	sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;

	SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
		SC_METHOD(checkYear);
		sensitive << year;
	}

	void checkYear() {
		if (year % 400 == 0) {
			is_leap_year.write(true);
		} else if (year % 100 == 0 && year % 400 != 0) {
			is_leap_year.write(false);
		} else if (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 && year % 400 != 0) {
			is_leap_year.write(true);
		} else {
			is_leap_year.write(false);
		}
	}
};
```

In this SystemC code, we define an `LeapYearChecker` module that includes input and output signals for the year and the result of the leap year check. We then define a `checkYear` method that takes the year as an input and checks if it is a leap year using the logic from the C++/C code. The `checkYear` method writes the result of the check to the output signal `is_leap_year` and ends.

The `LeapYearChecker` module's constructor takes in the `sc_in` signals `year` and `is_leap_year` and creates a sensitive block for the `checkYear` method. Finally, we place the `checkYear` method block inside the module's code to represent the function from the C++/C code.

To ensure that this SystemC code can integrate seamlessly with the provided signals, we use the `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals defined in the original C++/C code. In particular, we repurpose the `year` signal as the input to the `checkYear` method, and we use the `is_leap_year` signal to transmit the result of the leap year check. This enables us to reuse the existing testbench code with minimal modifications.
