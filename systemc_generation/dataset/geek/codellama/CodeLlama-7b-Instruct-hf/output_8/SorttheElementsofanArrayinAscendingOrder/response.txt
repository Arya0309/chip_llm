  As part of comprehending the behavior of the original C++ code, I read and understood the program thoroughly. Here is a line-by-line or block-by-block natural language diary that explains each principal line or block of code and its function:

// C++ program to sort an array in ascending order using a brute force approach utilizing bubble sort; this code is intended to be tested on the SystemC FPGA grounds utilizing the gathering tool for SystemC verification.

using namespace std; // Include the C++ library namespace "std".

void sort(int num [], int len) // Function to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
int len // size of the input array


for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) // For each step, check the last position already sorted to find whether certain items have to be ex changed.
 {isSwapped = false; // The state of the exchange is equipped with the initial leasing, which may be reset each step.  
int j = 1; // For each item in the current non sorted subset, compare its value with the corresponding value to the right of the fancy.

// The two elements are compared and stored.
int curr;  
curr = num [j]; // Define the second number.

num [j] = num [first]; // Define the first number.

num [second] = curr; // Store the first number.

// If the smaller element is pushed to the opposite side, the flag responded "1" since this indicates that the exchange was materialized,

isSwapped = true;

// Break the program if the exchange record indicated any exchange has not occurred.
if (!isSwapped )
break;

else // Otherwise, we will group the right half of the array.
for (int i = 0; i <len; i++)  // For each step, examine the array to see whether there's an undone exchange.
 {isSwapped = false;  // Set the exchange state flag to the false state.
 int j = 1;  // Equal to 1 to prevent comparison with the first element.

// Aside from the initial exchange, the second pass will continually search for swaps by continuously examining the array starting with the second element.

for (int j = 1; j <len - i; j++)  // The second pass begins when the sorting pulls the entire array.

// Aside from the initial exchange, the second pass will continually search for swaps by continuously examining the array starting with the second element.

//When there's a need for exchange, the numbers would switch sides, so the current item would be passed to the upper disk.

// The exchange is completed after each item is tested for an exchange of movement. 

for (int j =1 ;j < len -i; j++)  // check if the current item is exchanging.
 {isSwapped = false;

  // generate across the electronic vaginagraphy of the left.
int n = num [j ];  // after exchanging.
num [j] = num [j - 1];  // exchange the left and the right for the current.

Viewing the orbit following it, the numerical values of the updated bias as indicated above are grilled and stop at 1 for a certain amount of time.

num [j - 1] = num [j];  // This process occurs, the first and last position of the unit would naturally be compared.

num [j] = n;  // Thanks to the swapping, the elastic lisp interface is restarted once more.

Currentitem = num[ j-1 ];

The world of one's company and a value pointer, and further intensified to contain the final run values.

num [j- 1] = Currentitem;  // Further intensified, and I read.

So the above process involves two surviving cycles with the exchange of improvement being held for one idle time slot at a time before it's compared with the previous plus/minus unit; until the each slot ends and a condition flag required to break satisfies this, the algorithm continues to compare the last value with the value at the baseline and if the sorting completes this or not with several values that are swapped in adjacent lines of the array.

// True if there is a significant change.
if (!isSwapped)
break;

else // Otherwise we keep going.

// The first stage is complete when we receive the offers.
for (int i = 0; i <len; i++)  // We keep on examining the array until all swaps from the least are equal. 
 {isSwapped = false;  // We only consider the true to express exchange.

int j = 1; // Tip element that exclude a mystic struture to swag.

Compared with the value immediately adjacent to it.
for (int j = 1; j <len - i; j++)

If the two items are exchanged.

// There are exchanged during the second stage.
// Set flag to show that it has moved.

isSwapped = true;

// This breaks when it is possible to write.
if (!isSwapped)
break;

else // Otherwise, we'll work on the right.
for (int i = 0; i <len; i++)  // Place a sort. End on each iterator until no exchanges.
 {isSwapped = false;  // We can set this initial exchanger.

int j = 1;  // This excludes trombone number exchange.

We go through each.

for (int j = 1; j <len - i; j++) 

Change the formal exchangers.

// There are exchanges during the second pass.
// Set the switch to show exchange has taken place.
isSwapped = true;

// This breaks when it can edit.
if (!isSwapped)
break;

else // Otherwise, we halt.

for (int i = 0; i <len; i++)  // Keep sorting when possible swaps.
 {isSwapped = false; // We can set this near the point.

int j = 1; // Initiate these local variables.

We break it.

// The last element of the array is the last item.
num [j] = num [j - 1];  // Next index.

num [j - 1] = num [ j ];  // Swaps the highest index to just below.

// Repeat the slideshow of the above until no swaps happen.

for (int j = 1; j < len -i; j++) 

// Prevent initial exchange

int n = num [j];

// Next battery.
 num [j] = num [ j - 1 ];

// Next battery.
num [ j - 1 ] = n;

// Repeat the initial slide show of the above until swaps no longer occur.

for (int j = 1; j < len - i; j++) 

// prevent update 

num [j - 1] = num [j];

// see 

num [j] = num [j - 1];

// Setting up contains all records for all items throughout.

for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) // Celongration checks for more swaps.
// Celongration exchanges after each individual after this 

num [j -1] = num[ j ];  // Local representation of exchange.

num [j] = n;  // Next slot/Index.

// The process during each dwell duration is revived to satisfy the same final iterator condition as before; the same swaps with less consideration of the previous storage such as initial grilling tooling are checked for equality.

// The algorithm stops when it is confirmed that there is no more swapping or sorting.

// The swaps are checked here evenly.
isSwapped = true;

// Knowledge.
if (!isSwapped)

// We return with the knowledge of having completed our task with no other swaps remaining!

return;

}

else // Otherwise, we continue the main function.

// We don't just have to quit... check the input variable to direct the conditional.

if (start)

// ...we return immediately with the reporting variable equipped with true knowledge.

return;

// We continue to check the input subjects.

if (done)

// Once again, it is vital to quit since the output appends stresses to the partnership of our supply and demand.

return;

// At this point, we end up.
return;
