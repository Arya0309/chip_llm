  Here is a natural language explanation and SystemC code snippet that captures the behavior of the provided C++/C code snippet:

**Explanation**

This C++/C code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two given integers using a combination of a ternary operator and a while loop. The code first initializes two integer variables, `a` and `b`, with user-defined values. It then uses a ternary operator to determine which of `a` or `b` is the larger number, and stores the result in `max_num`.

The code then uses a while loop to increment `max_num` by 1 until it is divisible by both `a` and `b`. When this occurs, the loop breaks, and the output is printed to the console.

**SystemC Code**

The following SystemC code snippet captures the behavior of the C++/C code:
```scss
// SystemC code for LCM using if and while statements

// Declare input and output ports
sc_in<int> a;
sc_in<int> b;
sc_out<int> lcm_result;

// Define a module to calculate LCM
SC_MODULE(LCM) {
    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LCM) {
        // Declare variables
        int a = 15, b = 20, max_num, flag = 1;

        // Define a process to calculate LCM
        SC_METHOD(calculate_lcm);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to calculate LCM
    void calculate_lcm() {
        // Initialize variable to store LCM
        int lcm = 0;

        // Use ternary operator to get the larger number
        int max_num = (a > b) ? a : b;

        // While loop to increment max_num until it is divisible by both a and b
        while (max_num) {
            // Check if max_num is divisible by both a and b
            if (max_num % a == 0 && max_num % b == 0) {
                // Update LCM
                lcm = max_num;
                break;
            }

            // Increment max_num by 1
            ++max_num;
        }

        // Print LCM to console
        cout << "LCM of " << a << " and " << b << " is " << lcm << endl;
    }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Create an instance of the LCM module
    LCM lcm;

    // Run the LCM calculation
    lcm.calculate_lcm();

    // Wait for finish
    sc_stop();

    return 0;
}
```
Note that the SystemC code uses sensitivity list to detect changes in the input ports `a` and `b`, and performs the LCM calculation every time either of the inputs changes. The output `lcm_result` is set to the calculated LCM.
