  This code presents a program to find the normal and trace of a matrix of given size. It calls two functions, findNormal and findTrace, which each execute a different algorithm. The main function has an input. It then outputs a result of each function call.

The inputs
This C ++/C program gets an input matrix [] []. A given matrix is named matrix and is of size MAX with maximum value of 100. It is a function call, using a constant constant named MAX.

The output
The program outputs a trace and a normal. Trace and normal are returned by findTrace and findNormal in the main method. It uses two output ports, trace and norm, and assigns their values. When it writes trace, it takes the sum of the diagonal elements and writes it. When it writes the norm it uses findNormal and squareroots the resulting sum.

The algorithm
This algorithm goes through the matrix, column by column, to find the trace. It sums the elements of each row to create the column. The results are written in the trace output when it's done.

The algorithm goes through the matrix and squares each element and then multiplies each element by every other element regardless of position to find the normal. The results are written in the norm output when it's done.

The output values
Since the traces and norms are computed in the main method, they go to the outputs in the main method. However, they are named output to make it clear that they are results rather than inputs. It's returned as final result.
