  This C++/C code calculates the determinant of a matrix using a recursive formula. It takes in the matrix 4x4 as an input and returns the result as an output. Here is a line-by-line explanation of the code:



 1. #include<iostream> and #include<cmath> - Includes the I/O and mathematical libraries to perform calculations, respectively.

2. using namespace std; - Specifies to the compiler that we will be using the standard namespace.

3. const int MAXN=105; - Defines a constant called MAXN, which equals the integer 105.

4. double a[MAXN][MAXN];- Declares an array of arrays called a of type double with size MAXN x MAXN.

5. double determinant(int n)= - Declares a function called determinant that takes in an integer n as an input and returns a double value.

6. doubledet=1.0;-initializes the determinant to 1.0.

7. for (int i=0;i<n;i++) - Defines a for loop that iterates the integer i from 0 to n (inclusive).

8.int pivot=i; - Declares an integer called pivot, which initially equals the index i.

9. for (int j=i+1; j<n;j++) - Defines another for loop that iterates an integer j from i+1 to n (exclusive).

10. if (abs(a[j][i])> abs(a[pivot][i]))- Defines an if statement that checks if the absolute value of the element at position [j][i] of the matrix is greater than the absolute value of the element at position [pivot][i].

11. pivot=j; - If the statement is true, sets the variable pivot to the index j.

12. if (pivot != i)- Defines an if statement that checks if the index of pivot and i are not equal.

13.swap(a[i], a[pivot]);- If the statement is true, swaps the elements at position i and position pivot in the matrix.

14. det *= -1;- Updates the determinant variable to its current value multiplied by -1.

15. if (a[i][i] == 0)- Defines a check to validate that the element at position [i][i] is not zero, which is necessary for the recursive formula.

16. return 0;- Returns zero, indicating that the determinant cannot be solved.

17.det *= a[i][i];- If the element at position [i][i] is not zero, updates the determinant variable to its current value multiplied by the element at position [i][i].

18. for (int j=i+1; j<n; j++)  

19.   double    factor=a[j][i]/a[i][i];- Defines a double variable called factor that calculates the factor required to solve the equation.

20. for (int k = i+1; k<=n; k++)  

21.a[j][k]=a[j][k]- factor * a[i][k];- Updates the element at position [j][k] to the product of the factor and the element at position [i][k].

22.return  det;- Returns the determinant value.

23. int main() - This is the program's entry point.

24.int n=4;- Declares an integer variable called n and sets its value to 4.

25. double matrix[4][4] = {...}; - Defines a double array called matrix of size 4 x 4 and populates its elements with the values listed below.

26. for  (int i=0; i<n;i++) { - Defines a for loop that iterates over the rows of matrix.

27. for (int j=0; j<n; j++) { - Defines another for loop that iterates over the columns of matrix.

28.a[i][j] = matrix[i][j];- Assigns the element at position [i][j] of the matrix to the element at position [i][j] of array a.

29.}  }   -End of the loops

30. double det=determinant(n);- Calls the determinant function with argument n and assigns its return value to det.

31. cout<<" Determinant= "; - Outputs the message "Determinant= " to the standard output.

32. cout<< det<<endl;- Outputs the value of the variable det to the standard output.

33.return 0;- Indicates the termination of the program with a return value 0.

Sound familiar?

Now that you have a good understanding of the code, it's time to convert it to SystemC code. This section begins by including the SystemC library and declaring the necessary ports as mentioned earlier.

After that, we define a class called Adder that includes a SystemC method called add that performs the calculation.

 We also define a composition called useAdder to demonstrate that we can use the Adder object in our calculations.

The output file of the conversion follows the format below:


The determinant function can be embedded in the SystemC code as shown in the example below:

SC_MODULE (Determinant) {

 const int MAXN=105;

 double a[MAXN][MAXN];

 void determinant() {

 ```c++Blanks (; ```

    ) {

        double det=1.0;

        for (i=0; i<n; i++) {

            int pivot=i;

            for (j=i+1; j<n;j++)

                if (abs (a [j][i])> abs(a [pivot][i]))

                    pivot=j;

            if (pivot != i) {

                swap(a[i], a[pivot]);

                det*= -1;

            }

            if (a[i][  i]== 0)

                return 0;

            det*= a[i][i]

            for (j=i+1; j<n; j++) {

                     double factor=a [j][i] / a [i][i];

                      for (k=i+1; k<n; k++)



                          a[j][k]-= factor* a [i][k];




                      }

                    }


                  return det

              }



 void main() {

             double n=4;

             double matrix[4][4] ={{1, 0, 2, -1},

     This snippet of code presents the logic of the C++/C code in a compact form without overly complicating the syntax or semantics of it. Considering that the circuit can be flattened into a single flow without crossing any significant DSP thresholds, SystemC will effectively serve as a tool for diving into implementation details.
