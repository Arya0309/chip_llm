  **C++/C Code Summary**

This C++ code takes input n and checks if it is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digit. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number since 13 + 53 + 33 = 153.

The code first sets the input n to 153 and stores it in a temporary variable temp. It then initializes the product variable p to 0.

Next, the code enters a loop that calculates the sum of the cubes of the digits of n. It does this by taking the remainder of n divided by 10, multiplying it by the cube of that remainder (i.e., if the remainder is 3, the product would be 3^3 = 27), and then adding that product to p. The process is repeated until n is less than or equal to 0.

Finally, the code checks if the value of p is equal to temp. If they are equal, the program outputs "Yes. It is Armstrong No." Otherwise, it outputs "No. It is not an Armstrong No.".

**SystemC Code**

Here is the equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source:
```scss
// SystemC code for Armstrong number checker

#include <systemc.h>

// Input port for user input
sc_in<int> num_in;

// Output port to indicate whether the number is an Armstrong number or not
sc_out<bool> is_armstrong;

// Module to check if a number is an Armstrong number or not
SC_MODULE(ArmstrongNumberChecker) {
    SC_CTOR(ArmstrongNumberChecker) {
        // Process to calculate the sum of the cubes of the digits of num_in
        SC_METHOD(calculate_sum);
        sensitive << num_in;

        // Process to check if the sum is equal to num_in
        SC_METHOD(check_sum);
        sensitive << num_in;

        // Combine the two processes to create a complete checker
        is_armstrong = calculate_sum();
        is_armstrong = check_sum(is_armstrong);
    }

    // Function to calculate the sum of the cubes of the digits of num_in
    int calculate_sum() {
        int n = num_in;
        int temp = n;
        int p = 0;

        // Loop to calculate the sum of the cubes of the digits of n
        while (n > 0) {
            int rem = n % 10;
            p = (p) + (rem * rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        return p;
    }

    // Function to check if the sum is equal to num_in
    bool check_sum(bool is_armstrong) {
        if (num_in == is_armstrong) {
            return 1;
        }
        else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, we defined an input port `num_in` and an output port `is_armstrong` to receive and send the necessary data, respectively. We also defined a module `ArmstrongNumberChecker` that performs the calculation and check based on the input. The `calculate_sum` function calculates the sum of the cubes of the digits of `num_in`. The `check_sum` function checks if the sum is equal to `num_in`. Finally, we combined these two processes into a single module, `ArmstrongNumberChecker`, that returns `1` if the number is an Armstrong number and `0` otherwise.
