  Task Description Summary:

* Read and analyze the provided C++/C code.
* Determine the inputs and outputs of the code.
* Provide a line-by-line or block-by-block explanation of the code.
* Generate equivalent SystemC code that preserves the functionality and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.

C++/C Code Summary:

* The provided C++/C code defines a function `checkYear` that takes in an integer `year` as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the given year is a leap year or not.
* The function uses three conditional statements to determine leap years:
	+ A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 400.
	+ A year is not a leap year if it is divisible by 100 but not by 400.
	+ A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100.
* The function does not have any outputs.
* The provided C++/C code also includes a driver code that calls the `checkYear` function with a given year as an argument and checks whether the result is `true` or `false`.

SystemC Code Summary:

* To generate equivalent SystemC code, we can follow the same logic as the C++/C code and use three conditional statements to determine leap years.
* We can use the `sc_in<int> year` signal as the input to the function, and the `sc_out<bool>` signal `is_leap_year` as the output.
* The `checkYear` function can be defined as follows:


```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks if a year is a leap year or not
SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    sc_in<int> year;  // Input port for the year
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year; // Output port for the result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
        // Process to check if the year is a leap year
        SC_METHOD(check_year);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    // Method to check if the year is a leap year
    void check_year() {
        if (year % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year % 100 == 0 && !(year % 400 == 0)) {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        } else if (year % 4 == 0 && !(year % 100 == 0)) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```

To generate a SystemC code that preserves the exact same logic as the C++/C source code, we need to first identify the input and output ports and then implement the functions using SystemC keywords and methods.

The inputs to the C++/C source code are the year entered by the user, and the output is whether the year is a leap year or not.

 ```
 #include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks if a year is a leap year or not
SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    sc_in<int> year;  // Input port for the year
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year; // Output port for the result
```

The function is implemented using three conditional statements, just like in the C++/C source code. The first condition checks whether the year is divisible by 400 and returns `true` if so and `false` otherwise. The second condition checks whether the year is divisible by 100 but not by 400. If the third condition is true, then the year is not a leap year. Otherwise, the third condition checks whether the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100 and returns `true`. Finally, the fourth condition returns `false` if the year is not divisible by 4 or 100.

 ```
 void check_year() {
        if (year % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year % 100 == 0 && !(year % 400 == 0)) {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        } else if (year % 4 == 0 && !(year % 100 == 0)) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};
 ```

Therefore, the final SystemC code for this task should be as follows:

```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks if a year is a leap year or not
SC_MODULE(LeapYearChecker) {
    sc_in<int> year;  // Input port for the year
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year; // Output port for the result

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LeapYearChecker) {
        // Process to check if the year is a leap year
        SC_METHOD(check_year);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    // Method to check if the year is a leap year
    void check_year() {
        if (year % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year % 100 == 0 && !(year % 400 == 0)) {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        } else if (year % 4 == 0 && !(year % 100 == 0)) {
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else {
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```
This code does not only generate the respective inputs and outputs but also does this job with high-level reasoning. Consequently avoiding the use of unnecessary bits that reduces the amount of memory and execution overhead thus resulting in performance optimization while executing the code on various hardware boards.
