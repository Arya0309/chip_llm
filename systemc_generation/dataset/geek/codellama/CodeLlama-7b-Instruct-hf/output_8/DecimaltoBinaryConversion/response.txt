  This program is a simple console application written in C++ that will convert a decimal number into a binary number. The purpose of the program is to demonstrate one way to approach algorithmic logic with embedded digital systems. Instead, factors, arithmetic, loops, and functions are utilized in the C++ program to carry out the conve- rsion of a binary number into a decimal number successfully. 

 The inputs to the program are the numbers to be converted, which have to be greater than 0 and less than 32 (or 2 to the power of 32, whichever is greater, as these are the highest decimal values capable of being represented by a 32-bit unsigned integer). The output of the program is the converted binary value. Furthermore, the actual communication among the various elements of the electronic system is possible only on the basis of signals, which are essentially manipulated by consequent data transformation or guidance processes. The input a corresponds to the input argument passed into the function decToBinary, while b corresponds to a binary number representation of the desired binary value. 

The actual conversion process is carried out within the lines 6 - 12 of the first block. The conversion is effected by using a method called a bit-wise operation: the modulo operator and the integer divide operator. This gives the resulting binary 'digits' for the input number.

The functional logic within the main program is accomplished through the while loop due to the presence of the modulo operator and the boolean conversion. Both the condition check and the loop update are carried out concurrently.

 The second code snippet shows how the functionality of the input and output bits can be achieved in SystemC. The decToBinary method converts the input binary value to a decimal value and returns the result, with the help of a loop that computes the binary exponentiation of the number twice. The program takes a number as input and produces the output to the console, the binary representation of that number. The output from the top module has no structure, but approximately resembles a series of binary digits. The logic of the program can be replicated in SystemC.
