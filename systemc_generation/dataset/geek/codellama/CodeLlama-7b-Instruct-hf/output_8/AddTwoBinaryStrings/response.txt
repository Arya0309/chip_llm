  The provided C++/C code adds two binary strings. The code first checks if one of the input strings is greater in length than the other, and if so, swaps them. Then, it calculates the difference between the lengths of the two strings and creates a padding string with the necessary number of zeroes to prefix the shorter string. Then, it iterates on the longer of the two strings from right to left, using a carry variable to keep track of borrowing zeroes if necessary. If a carry is detected, it adds it to the result string. The process continues till the end of the longer string, and finally, the carry is added at the end of the result string, if necessary. Finally, the function returns the sum string.

This process can be translated to SystemC as follows:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two binary strings
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    // Input ports
    sc_in<string> A;
    sc_in<string> B;
    sc_out<string> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << A << B;
    }

    // Method to add the two binary strings
    void add() {
        // Check if the length of A is greater than the length of B
        if (A.length() > B.length()) {
            // Swap A and B
            swap(A, B);
        }

        // Calculate the difference between the lengths of A and B
        int diff = B.length() - A.length();

        // Create a padding string with the necessary number of zeroes
        // to prefix the shorter string A if necessary
        string padding;
        for (int i = 0; i < diff; i++) {
            padding.push_back('0');
        }

        // If the shorter string A needs to be padded, pad it
        if (padding != "") {
            A = padding + A;
        }

        // Variables to keep track of the result and carry
        string res;
        char carry = '0';

        // Iterate on the longer string A from right to left
        for (int i = A.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // If the current character in A is 1 and the current character in B is 1
            if (A[i] == '1' && B[i] == '1') {
                // If the carry is 1, add 1 to the result string and set the carry to 1
                if (carry == '1') {
                    res.push_back('1');
                    carry = '1';
                // Otherwise, add 0 to the result string and set the carry to 0
                } else {
                    res.push_back('0');
                    carry = '1';
                }
            // If the current character in A is 0 and the current character in B is 0
            } else if (A[i] == '0' && B[i] == '0') {
                // If the carry is 1, add 0 to the result string and set the carry to 0
                if (carry == '1') {
                    res.push_back('0');
                    carry = '0';
                // Otherwise, add 0 to the result string and set the carry to 0
                } else {
                    res.push_back('0');
                    carry = '0';
                }
            // If the current character in A is not equal to the current character in B
            } else if (A[i] != B[i]) {
                // If the carry is 1, add 0 to the result string and set the carry to 1
                if (carry == '1') {
                    res.push_back('0');
                    carry = '1';
                // Otherwise, add 1 to the result string and set the carry to 0
                } else {
                    res.push_back('1');
                    carry = '0';
                }
            }
        }

        // If at the end there is a carry, add it to the result
        if (carry == '1') {
            res.push_back(carry);
        }

        // Reverse the result string
        reverse(res.begin(), res.end());

        // Remove leading zeroes from the result string
        int index = 0;
        while (index + 1 < res.length() && res[index] == '0') {
            index++;
        }

        sum = res.substr(index);
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the module takes two string inputs (`A` and `B`), and an output string (`sum`) as its ports. The module also has a `sc_method` that performs the addition, which is sensitive to both `A` and `B`. The method first checks if one of the input strings is greater in length than the other and swaps them if necessary. It then calculates the difference between the lengths of the two strings and creates a padding string with the necessary number of zeroes to prefix the shorter string. The method then iterates on the longer string from right to left, using a carry variable to keep track of borrowing zeroes if necessary. If a carry is detected, it adds it to the result string. The process continues till the end of the longer string, and finally, the carry is added at the end of the result string, if necessary. Finally, the method returns the sum string.

Note that this SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source code, and it also incorporates the signals defined above to make it seamlessly integratable with our existing testbench.
