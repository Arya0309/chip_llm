  Inputs:

* int m[r][c], where r and c are the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively
* int r (the number of rows in the matrix)
* int c (the number of columns in the matrix)

Output:

* The sorted 2D matrix (m)

The given C++/C code sorts a 2D matrix row-wise. The input to the function is a 2D matrix, the number of rows, and the number of columns. The output of the function is the sorted 2D matrix.

Line-by-line Explanation:

* includes the necessary headers (stdc++) and defines the namespace std.
* defines a swap function to swap two integers.
* defines the sortRowWise function that takes a 2D matrix (m), the number of rows (r), and the number of columns (c) as inputs.
* sorts the matrix row-wise by using a nested for loop. The inner-most loop compares and swaps the elements in each row.
* prints the sorted matrix.
* defines the main function that creates a 2D matrix and calls the sortRowWise function to sort it.

SystemC Implementation:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

module Sort2DMatrix(input logic clk, input logic start, output logic done, input logic [3:0] m [4:0][4:0], output logic [3:0] m [4:0][4:0]);

	// functions here

endmodule
```
