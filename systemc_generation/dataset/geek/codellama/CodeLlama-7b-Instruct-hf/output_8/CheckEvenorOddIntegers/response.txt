  **C++/C Code Analysis and SystemC Automation**

**Introduction**
This code repository contains a C++/C program that evaluates whether a given integer is even or odd. For this assignment, we will analyze the code, identify the inputs and outputs, and generate SystemC code that captures the same behavior.

**C++/C Code Analysis**
The provided C++/C code defines a simple program that takes an integer `n` as input and outputs whether it is even or odd. The program uses the modulo operator (`%`) to determine whether `n` is divisible by 2. If `n` is even (divisible by 2), the program prints "Even" to the console. Otherwise, it prints "Odd."

**Input and Output**
The input to the program is a single integer `n`, while the output is a string with the value "Even" or "Odd."

**Explanation and SystemC Code**
The SystemC code generated from the provided C++/C code will have the following inputs and outputs:

**Inputs**

* `number_in` with a range ```[0, 2147483647]``` (32-bit signed integer)

**Outputs**

* `result_out` with a range ```[0, 2147483647]``` (32-bit signed integer)

Here's a natural language, line-by-line explanation of the generated SystemC code:

1. `SC_MODULE(Adder)` defines a module that performs addition between two 32-bit signed integers.
2. `a` and `b` are input ports of type `sc_int<32>` that accept the two integers to add.
3. `SC_METHOD(add)` defines a process to perform addition between `a` and `b`.
4. `SC_CTOR(Adder)` is the constructor of the `Adder` module, which calls the `add` process and makes its input ports `a` and `b` sensitive to changes.
5. The `add` process reads the values of `a` and `b` and writes their sum to `result_out`.
6. `SC_END` marks the end of the `Adder` module.

Here's the complete SystemC code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<sc_int<32>> a; // input port for the first number
    sc_in<sc_int<32>> b; // input port for the second number
    sc_out<sc_int<32>> result_out; // output port for the sum

    SC_METHOD(add) {
        // perform addition between a and b
        result_out.write(a.read() + b.read());
    }

    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // make a and b sensitive to changes for add
        sensitive << a << b;
    }
};
```
Note that this generated SystemC code utilizes the `sc_int<32>` type to ensure that the input and output types match the C++/C code. Also, the `sc_in` and `sc_out` types are used to define the input and output ports, respectively.
