  This C++/C code implements a simple bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Here is a line-by-line natural language summary of the code:

1. The `sort` function is declared, which takes an array of integers `num` and its length `len` as input.
2. The function sorts the array by repeatedly iterating over the array from the beginning to the end and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
3. The `isSwapped` boolean variable is declared and initialized to false. It is used to check if any swaps occurred during the previous iteration, indicating that the array is sorted and the algorithm can stop.
4. The `for` loop iterates over the array from the beginning to the end, and the `isSwapped` variable is set to false after each iteration to assume that no swaps occurred.
5. The outer `for` loop iterates over the entire array, and the inner `for` loop iterates over the remaining elements in the array that are not yet sorted.
6. If the current element is smaller than the previous element, the `swapNums` function is called to swap the two elements.
7. The `isSwapped` variable is set to true to indicate that a swap occurred.
8. If the outer `for` loop completes without finding any swaps, it means that the array is sorted and the algorithm can stop.
9. The function returns.

`swapNums` function is declared and implemented outside the `sort` function. It takes two integers `first` and `second` as input and swaps them by using a temporary variable.

In natural language, the code simply takes an array of integers and sorts them in an ascending order using a simple bubble sort algorithm.

Based on the C++/C code provided, we can generate the following SystemC code that replicates the behavior of the original code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

/**
 * @brief Sorts an array of integers in ascending order
 * using a simple bubble sort algorithm.
 */
SC_MODULE(BubbleSort) {
    // Input ports
    sc_in<int> num[ARRAY_LENGTH];
    sc_in<int> len;

    // Output port
    sc_out<int> sorted_num[ARRAY_LENGTH];

    SC_CTOR(BubbleSort) {
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << num << len;
    }

    /**
     * @brief Sorts the input array in ascending order.
     */
    void sort() {
        // Initialize the sorted array
        for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_LENGTH; i++) {
            sorted_num[i] = num[i];
        }

        // Sort the array using bubble sort
        bool is_swapped = true;
        while (is_swapped) {
            is_swapped = false;
            for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_LENGTH-1; i++) {
                if (sorted_num[i] > sorted_num[i+1]) {
                    swapNums(sorted_num[i], sorted_num[i+1]);
                    is_swapped = true;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    /**
     * @brief Swap two numbers in the sorted array.
     *
     * @param first The first number to swap.
     * @param second The second number to swap.
     */
    void swapNums(int first, int second) {
        int temp = first;
        first = second;
        second = temp;
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, we declare two input vectors `num` and `len`, and an output vector `sorted_num`. The `sort` function takes the input arrays and sorts them in ascending order using a simple bubble sort algorithm. The `swapNums` function is also defined to swap two numbers in the sorted array.

Finally, we implement the `BubbleSort` module that integrates the `sort` and `swapNums` functions and input and output ports.

Note that the SystemC code uses the `sensitive` keyword to indicate which signals to sensitize the `BubbleSort` module to. This ensures that the module updates its outputs whenever its inputs change.

Overall, the SystemC code provided captures the logic of the original C++/C source code and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow to generate hardware circuits that perform the same function.
