  ## Analysis

The provided C++/C code checks whether a given number is a prime number or not using a simple trial division approach. The code consists of a `main()` function that takes no arguments, a `n` integer variable that represents the number to be checked, and a `cnt` integer variable that keeps track of the number of divisors of `n`.

The `main()` function first initializes `cnt` to 0 and reads `n` from the user. It then checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, and if it is, prints "NOT prime" and returns. Otherwise, it starts a **loop** from 1 to `n` to check for divisibility of `n`.

Inside the loop, the code checks whether `n` is divisible by `i` by using the modulo operator (`n % i`). If `n` is divisible by `i`, the loop increments `cnt`. Once the loop is done, it checks if `n` is divisible by more than 2 numbers (as prime numbers must be divisible by 1 and themselves) and prints "NOT prime" if it is. Otherwise, it prints "prime".

Finally, the `main()` function returns 0.

## Summary

The inputs of the program are the number to be checked, and the outputs are the string "prime" or "NOT prime". The code performs a simple trial division approach by checking for divisibility from 1 to the input number. If the input number is divisible by more than 2 numbers, it is considered not prime.

The code follows these logical steps:

1. Initialize `cnt` to 0.
2. Read input `n` from the user.
3. Check if `n` is less than or equal to 1, and if it is, print "NOT prime" and return.
4. Start a loop from 1 to `n` to check for divisibility of `n`.
5. Inside the loop, check if `n` is divisible by `i` by using the modulo operator (`n % i`). If it is divisible, increment `cnt`.
6. Once the loop is done, check if `n` is divisible by more than 2 numbers.
7. Print "prime" if `n` is not divisible by more than 2 numbers, and "NOT prime" otherwise.
8. Return 0.

## SystemC Code

The SystemC code below faithfully captures the same logic as the C++/C code, but with the use of SystemC primitives such as `sc_in<int> n;`  and `sc_out<bool> is_prime;`.

```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimeNumber) {
    SC_CTOR(PrimeNumber) {
        SC_METHOD(main);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    void main() {
        if (n <= 1) {
            is_prime.write(false);
        } else {
            int cnt = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                if (n % i == 0)
                    cnt++;
            }

            if (cnt > 2)
                is_prime.write(false);
            else
                is_prime.write(true);
        }
    }
};
```

It is important to note that the SystemC code preserves the same functionality as the C++/C code, but with the use of SystemC primitives. The user can integrate it with our existing testbench by using the `n` and `is_prime` ports.
