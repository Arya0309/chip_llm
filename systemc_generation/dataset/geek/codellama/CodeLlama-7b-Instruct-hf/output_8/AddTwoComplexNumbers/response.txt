  Explanation:
The C++/C code provided is a simple program that implements the addition of two complex numbers. The `Complex` class takes two real and imaginary parts as input and provides methods for performing various arithmetic operations on the complex numbers. The `addComp()` method is called on two `Complex` objects `C1` and `C2` to add their real and imaginary parts and return the sum as a new `Complex` object `C3`.

Inputs:
Code inputs:

* `real1` (real part of `C1`)
* `imag1` (imaginary part of `C1`)
* `real2` (real part of `C2`)
* `imag2` (imaginary part of `C2`)

Outputs:
Code outputs:

* `real_sum` (real part of the sum of `C1` and `C2`)
* `imag_sum` (imaginary part of the sum of `C1` and `C2`)

Summary:
The C++/C code takes the real parts `real1`, `real2`, and the imaginary parts `imag1`, `imag2`, and uses the `Complex` class to add them together to obtain the sum `C3`. The real part of `C3` is assigned to `real_sum`, and the imaginary part is assigned to `imag_sum`, which are then output.

SystemC equivalent:
The SystemC code below creates a module `Adder` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input ports, and computes their sum as output.
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to add the two numbers
    void add() {
        sum.write(a.read() + b.read());
    }
};
```
Note that the SystemC code uses the `int` data type instead of `Complex` for simplicity. The `Float` data type could also be used instead if needed. Additionally, the SystemC code does not include the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers as inputs, as the original C++/C code does.

Incorporating the signals defined above:
To integrate with the existing testbench, the SystemC code must use the inputs and outputs defined in the `sc_in` and `sc_out` signals. Therefore, the SystemC code would need to be modified as follows:
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> real1;  // Input port for real part of C1
    sc_in<int> imag1;  // Input port for imaginary part of C1
    sc_in<int> real2;  // Input port for real part of C2
    sc_in<int> imag2;  // Input port for imaginary part of C2
    sc_out<int> real_sum;  // Output port for real part of C3
    sc_out<int> imag_sum;  // Output port for imaginary part of C3

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << real1 << imag1 << real2 << imag2;
    }

    // Method to add the two numbers
    void add() {
        real_sum = real1.read() + real2.read();
        imag_sum = imag1.read() + imag2.read();
        sum.write(real_sum + imag_sum);
    }
};
```
Note that `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, and `sum` are the signals used in the testbench, while `real_sum`, `imag_sum`, and `c3` are the variables used in the SystemC code. Therefore, the SystemC code must use `real1`, `imag1`, `real2`, `imag2`, and `sum` as inputs, and `real_sum`, `imag_sum`, and `c3` as outputs. The `call` statement is not necessary to invoke the `add()` method, as it is called automatically when a change in the input values occurs.
