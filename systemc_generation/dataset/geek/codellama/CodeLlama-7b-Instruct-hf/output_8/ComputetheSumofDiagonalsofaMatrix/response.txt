  This C++/C code snippet calculates the sum of the main diagonals of a given square matrix of size `n` and outputs two values: the sum of the main diagonal and the sum of the secondary diagonal. The resulting SystemC code must utilize the provided signals and satisfy the requirements outlined in the instructions.

Summary:

* There are 3 input ports: `matrix`, `n`, and `SIZE`; and one output port for each diagonal sum: `principal` and `secondary`.
* The input `matrix` is a 2D array of size `n`, where each element contains a single integer.
* The input `SIZE` is the size of the input matrix.
* The output `principal` and `secondary` contain the sum of the main diagonal and secondary diagonal of the input matrix.
* The input `n` specifies the size of the input matrix.

The `printDiagonalSums()` function calculates the sum of the main diagonal and secondary diagonal of the input matrix by iterating over the rows and columns of the matrix.
• It initially initializes the `principal` and `secondary` variables to 0 to hold the sum of the respective diagonals.
• It then iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix using a nested `for` loop.
• For each element of the matrix:
o  The `if` statement conditions check if the current element is on the main diagonal (i.e., if the row index `i` equals the column index `j`).
o  If the element is on the main diagonal, the `principal` variable is incremented by the value of the element.
o  Otherwise, the `if` statement checks if the current element is on the secondary diagonal (i.e., if the row index plus the column index equals the `n`-1).
  * If the element is on the secondary diagonal, the `secondary` variable is incremented by the value of the element.
  
In the end, the `cout` statements display the values of the main diagonal and secondary diagonals.
