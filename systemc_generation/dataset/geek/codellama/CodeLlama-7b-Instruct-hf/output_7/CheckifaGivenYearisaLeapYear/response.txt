  Task: Summarize and analyze the provided C++/C code, and generate equivalent SystemC code that captures the same logic.

**Inputs and Outputs**: The C++/C code takes in a single integer input `year` and outputs a boolean value indicating whether the given year is a leap year or not. The output can be represented using a SystemC `sc_out` port or signal.

**Code Summary**: The C++/C code is a simple function that calculates whether a given year is a leap year or not. The logic works as follows:

* If the year is a multiple of 400, it is a leap year regardless of whether it is a multiple of 100 or not.
* If the year is not a multiple of 400, but it is a multiple of 100, it is not a leap year.
* If the year is not a multiple of 100 but it is a multiple of 4, it is a leap year.
* In all other cases, the year is not a leap year.

The code provides a `main` function that calls the `checkYear` function, which encapsulates the logic to determine whether the given year is a leap year or not. The function takes in an input `year` and returns a boolean value indicating whether it is a leap year or not. The `CheckYear` function is then called with the `2000` input in the `main` function, and the output is written to the console.

**SystemC Code**: The generated SystemC code that captures the same logic as the provided C++/C code is shown below:
```c
// SystemC code to check if a given year is a leap year or not
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks if a given year is a leap year or not
SC_MODULE(LeapYear) {
    // Input port for the year
    sc_in<int> year;
    // Output port for the leap year result
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(LeapYear) {
        // Process to determine if the year is a leap year
        SC_METHOD(CheckYear);
        sensitive << year;
    }

    // Function to determine if the given year is a leap year or not
    void CheckYear() {
        int year = year.read(); // Read the input year

        if (year % 400 == 0) { // If the year is a multiple of 400, it is a leap year
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else if (year % 100 == 0 && year % 4 != 0) { // If the year is not a multiple of 100 and a multiple of 4, it is not a leap year
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        } else if (year % 4 == 0) { // If the year is a multiple of 4, but not a multiple of 100, it is a leap year
            is_leap_year.write(true);
        } else { // All other years are not leap years
            is_leap_year.write(false);
        }
    }
};

// Testbench for the LeapYear module
SC_MODULE(LeapYearTestbench) {
    // Input signals for the LeapYear module
    sc_in<int> year;
    // Output signals for the LeapYear module
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year;

    // Instantiate the LeapYear module
    LeapYear leap_year_module("leap_year_module");

    // Connect the input and output signals
    leap_year_module.year(year);
    leap_year_module.is_leap_year(is_leap_year);

    // Run the testbench
    sc_start();

    // Check the output of the LeapYear module
    if (is_leap_year.read() == true) {
        cout << "Year " << year.read() << " is a leap year." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Year " << year.read() << " is not a leap year." << endl;
    }
}

// Main function to run the LeapYearTestbench
int main() {
    LeapYearTestbench testbench("testbench");
    testbench.year(2000); // Set the input year to 2000
    testbench.run(); // Run the testbench
    return 0;
}
```
The generated SystemC code creates a `LeapYear` module that encapsulates the logic to determine if a given year is a leap year or not. The module has two input ports and one output port, corresponding to the input `year` and output `is_leap_year`. The `CheckYear` function is called by the `Main` function to determine the leap year result. The `LeapYearTestbench` module is used to create an instantiation of the `LeapYear` module with a testbench that connects the input and output signals and runs the testbench. The `main` function creates an instance of the `LeapYearTestbench` module and sets the input `year` to 2000. The testbench is then run, and the output of the `LeapYear` module is checked using the `if-else` statement.

In conclusion, the generated SystemC code faithfully captures the logic of the provided C++/C code and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow to perform the same functionality as the provided C++/C code.
