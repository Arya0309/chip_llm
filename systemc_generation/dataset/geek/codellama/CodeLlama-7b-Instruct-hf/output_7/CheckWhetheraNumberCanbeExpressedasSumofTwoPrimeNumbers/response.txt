  C++/C Code:
```
// C++ program to check if a prime number can be expressed as sum of two Prime Numbers
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check whether a number is prime or not
bool isPrime(int n)
{
    if (n <= 1)
        return false;

    for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++)
    {
        if (n % i == 0)
            return false;
    }

    return true;
}

// Function to check if a prime number can be expressed as sum of two Prime Numbers
bool isPossible(int N)
{
    // if the number is prime, and number-2 is also prime
    if (isPrime(N) && isPrime(N - 2))
        return true;
    else
        return false;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    int n = 13;

    if (isPossible(n))
        cout << "Yes";
    else
        cout << "No";

    return 0;
}
```

Inputs:

* `n_in`: An integer input to the system

Outputs:

* `result_out`: A boolean output from the system indicating whether `n_in` can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers

Summary:

This code defines two functions: `isPrime` and `isPossible`. `isPrime` checks if a given number is prime, and `isPossible` checks if a given number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The driver code provides an example input (13) and evaluates whether it is possible to express 13 as the sum of two prime numbers using the `isPossible` function. The final output is a boolean indicating whether `n_in` can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

Block-by-Block Explanation:

1. The header file `<bits/stdc++.h>` is included, bringing in various C++ standard library components such as support for vectors and vectors. This is followed by the line `using namespace std;`, which allows referencing the standard library as a single namespace.
2. The functions `isPrime` and `isPossible` are defined. `isPrime` takes in a single integer `n` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether `n` is prime or not. The function first checks if `n` is less than 1, as primes are only defined for naturals. If `n` is a prime, the function then iterates through all numbers from 2 to `sqrt(n)`, checking if `n` is divisible by any of those numbers. If a divisor is found, it returns false, else it returns true.
3. `isPossible` takes in a single integer `N` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether `N` can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The function first checks whether `N` is prime by calling `isPrime`. If `N` is not prime, it returns false. If `N` is prime, it evaluates whether `N - 2` is also prime by calling `isPrime` again. If `N - 2` is not prime, `isPossible` returns false, else it returns true.
4. The driver code defines an example input `n` of 13 and evaluates whether it is possible to express 13 as the sum of two prime numbers using `isPossible`. If the result is positive, the code outputs "Yes". Else, it outputs "No".

SystemC Code:
```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n_in; // Input port for the number to be checked
    sc_out<bool> result_out; // Output port for the result

    // Function to check whether a number is prime or not
    bool isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1)
            return false;

        for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++)
        {
            if (n % i == 0)
                return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

    // Function to check if a prime number can be expressed as sum of two prime numbers
    bool isPossible(int N) {
        // if the number is prime, and number-2 is also prime
        if (isPrime(N) && isPrime(N - 2))
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    }

    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        SC_METHOD(checkPrime);
        sensitive << n_in;
    }

    void checkPrime() {
        bool possible = isPossible(n_in.read());
        result_out.write(possible);
    }
};
```

In the SystemC code, the module `PrimeChecker` has an input port `n_in`, an output port `result_out`, and two functions: `isPrime` and `isPossible`. The `isPrime` function is the same as in the C++/C code, while `isPossible` first checks if the input number is prime by calling `isPrime`, before checking if the input minus 2 is also prime. The module also has a method `checkPrime` that is sensitive to the input and updates the output accordingly.

Note that the SystemC code uses the `sc_in`, `sc_out`, and `sc_in/sc_out` channels to connect inputs and outputs with the module, as defined in the `n_in` and `result_out` signals referenced earlier. These connectors are necessary for integration with the testbench.
