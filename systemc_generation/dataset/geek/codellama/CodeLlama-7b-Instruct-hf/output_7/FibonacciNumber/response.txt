  This is a straightforward algorithm to find the Nth Fibonacci number using a loop. Now, here are some key insights to understand the code and generate an equivalent SystemC snippet containing the same logic.
* It takes an integer input named 'n' as a parameter in the main function of C++, and the return value from the C++ function is assigned to a variable named 'result' in the main function.
* The 'n' parameter will determine the Greatest integer that the algorithm will run.
* The general idea of the algorithm is to accumulate the series of Fibonacci numbers using a variable named 'curr' and a pair of variables named 'prev1' and 'prev2' to save the previous 2 numbers - let's say (a,b).
* The variables will be recursively updated at each iteration of the loop until the 'n'th number is reached, based on the current pair of 'curr' and 'a' and the previous pair of (a,b). This can literally iterate over the series f(0) f(1)... to f(n) while eventually returning the value of the 'curr' variable as the result. 
* When the user inputs number 'n', the algorithm executes recursively, using the current calculated number 'a' and the previous number 'b' to calculate the next Fibonacci number displayed at each iterator call, and the final result is output 'result'.

Here is a line-by-line explanation of the C++ function, creating a corresponding snippet of SystemC code that maintains the same logic:
Args: N - an integer value representing the index or the nth fibonacci number to be displayed.
        result - an output integer variable showing the input fibonacci number.
capital function fibpackages: namespace std;  // needed by program
return - an output result - an int  // function to return the value of default string is Fibonacci number at nth 
        if (n <= 1)  // returns zero at n=1 and n=0
returns:
result

Here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet containing the same functionality and integrating with the provided signals:
The C++ code calculates the nth Fibonacci number as the result after executing a program with the inputs of n (integer input signal test_i) and returns the results (output integer signal result).

Consider using this SystemC code in a high-level synthesis flow to perform the computation and compare the results to your input values.
