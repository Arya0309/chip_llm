  Inputs:

* `n`: an integer value that represents the number of natural numbers to be summed.

Outputs:

* `result`: an integer value that represents the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

Line-by-line analysis:

1. Includes the standard input/output libraries and the `using namespace` directive, enabling us to use the standard input/output streams directly.
2. Defines a function called `findSum` that takes in an integer value `n` and returns the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

Series of statements:
* Declares two variables `sum` and `i` as integers.
* Initializes `sum` to 0.
* Begins a for-loop with a condition to check if `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
* Increments `i` for each iteration of the loop.
* Calculates the sum of `i` and `sum`, storing the result in `sum`.
* Returns the value of `sum` from the function.
3. Declares an integer variable `n` with the value 5.
4. Calls the `findSum` function and passes in the value of `n`.
5. Prints the result of the function to the console.
6. Returns 0 as an exit code.

Equivalent SystemC code:

```c++
#include <systemc.h>

// C++ program to find sum of first n natural numbers. 

// Returns sum of first n natural 
// numbers 
sc_module(findSum) {
    sc_in<unsigned int> n;  // Input port for n
    sc_out<unsigned int> result; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(findSum) {
    }

    // Method to find the sum of first n natural numbers
    void FindSum(unsigned int n) {
        unsigned int sum = 0;
        for (unsigned int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            sum = sum + i;
        }
        result.write(sum);
        return sum;
    }
};
```

In the SystemC code, we define a module called `findSum` that takes in an integer value `n` as an input and returns the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The module declares two ports, `n` as an input port and `result` as an output port. The module has a constructor that initializes the ports and a method called `FindSum` that takes in an integer value `n` and returns the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The `FindSum` method follows the same logic as the original C++/C function, calculating the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and storing the result in the `result` port.
To incorporate the signals defined above, we modified the input port to `n` and the output port to `result` in the SystemC code.
Note that the SystemC code is written in a modular way, making it easier to integrate with a high-level synthesis flow.
