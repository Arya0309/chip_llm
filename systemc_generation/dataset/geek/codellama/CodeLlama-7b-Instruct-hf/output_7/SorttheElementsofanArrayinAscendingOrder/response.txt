  The provided C++/C code is a simple program for sorting an array of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The code declares a function `sort` that takes an array of integers `num` and its size `len` as input and sorts the array in place. The function uses a brute-force approach, where it iterates `len-1` times, each time finding the largest element and exchanging it with the last unsorted element. The function also checks whether any swaps occurred during the iteration and breaks if no swaps occurred, indicating that the array is sorted.

The code also includes a `main` function that demonstrates the usage of the `sort` function. The `main` function first declares an array of integers and initializes it with some values. It then uses the `sort` function to sort the array in place. Finally, the `main` function prints the sorted array.

The input to the system is the array of integers to be sorted, which is represented by the variable `nums` in the `main` function and the `num` array argument in the `sort` function. The output of the system is the sorted array, which is printed in the `main` function.

To generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet, we first need to identify the inputs and outputs of the system. The input is the array of integers to be sorted, which is represented by the variable `nums` in the `main` function and the `num` array argument in the `sort` function. The output of the system is the sorted array, which is also printed in the `main` function.

Next, we need to identify the major lines and blocks of code in the provided C++/C code and their functionality. The sort function is the main functionality of the system, and it iterates over the array of integers and swaps the values of adjacent elements to sort the array. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `sort` function and prints the sorted array.

Based on this analysis, here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:
```systemc
// Ports for input and output of the system
sc_in<int> nums;  
sc_out<int> sortedNums;

// Function to sort the input array in ascending order
auto sort = [](int len) {
    for (int i = 0; i < len-1; i++) {
        bool sorted = true;
        for (int j = 1; j < len-i; j++) {
            if (nums[j] < nums[j-1]) {
                sorted = false;
                int temp = nums[j];
                nums[j] = nums[j-1];
                nums[j-1] = temp;
            }
        }
        if (!sorted) {
            break;
        }
    }
};

// Driver code to demonstrate the usage of the sort function
auto main = [&](void) {
    int len = 5;
    nums.write(0, 1);
    nums.write(1, 12);
    nums.write(2, 6);
    nums.write(3, 8);
    nums.write(4, 10);

    sort(len);

    sortedNums.write(0, nums[0]);
    sortedNums.write(1, nums[1]);
    sortedNums.write(2, nums[2]);
    sortedNums.write(3, nums[3]);
    sortedNums.write(4, nums[4]);

    return 0;
};
```
In the above SystemC code, the `nums` and `sortedNums` pointer signals are used to transport the input and output data, respectively, from the `main` function to the `sort` function. The `sort` function is implemented as a C++/C++ lambda function that uses the SystemC `auto` keyword to declare and implement the function. The `main` function is also implemented as a C++/C++ lambda function that demonstrates the usage of the `sort` function and prints the sorted array.

Note that the `main` function uses the `nums.write` method to write the input array values to the `nums` pointer signal at the corresponding indices, and the `sortedNums.write` method to write the sorted array values to the `sortedNums` pointer signal at the corresponding indices. The `sort` function uses the `nums.read` method to read the array values from the `nums` pointer signal at the corresponding indices, and the `nums.write` method to write the sorted array values back to the `nums` pointer signal at the corresponding indices.
