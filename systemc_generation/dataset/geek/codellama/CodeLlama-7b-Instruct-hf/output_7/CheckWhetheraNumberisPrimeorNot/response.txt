  C++/C Code Summary and SystemC Equivalent
====================================================================

The provided C++/C code is a program that checks whether a given number is a prime number using a simple trial division method. The inputs and outputs of the code are as follows:

Inputs:
--------

* `n`: The number to be tested for primeness.

Outputs:
---------

* `is_prime`: A Boolean variable that indicates whether `n` is prime or not.

The code consists of the following major blocks of functionality:

1. Declarations: The code begins by declaring the variables `n`, `cnt`, and the input/output ports `n` and `is_prime` using the `sc_in` and `sc_out` keywords of SystemC, respectively.
2. Input Validation: The code then checks if the input `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, the program outputs that `n` is not prime and exits.
3. Division Test: If `n` is greater than 1, the program starts a division test. It checks if `n` is divisible by any number between 1 and `n`. If so, the counter `cnt` increments.
4. Prime Check: After the division test, the program checks if `n` is divisible by more than 2 numbers. If so, it outputs that `n` is not prime and exits. If not, it outputs that `n` is prime.

SystemC Equivalent of the C++/C Code
-----------------------------------------

Here is a SystemC equivalent of the C++/C code:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks whether a given number is prime
SC_MODULE(IsPrime) {
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<bool> is_prime;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(IsPrime) {
        // Process to check for primeness
        SC_METHOD(check_primeness);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to check primeness
    void check_primeness() {
        int cnt = 0;

        // Check if number is less than/equal to 1
        if (n <= 1) {
            is_prime = false;
            return;
        }

        // Check for divisors from 1 to n
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

            // Check if number is divisible
            if (n == i)
                cnt++;
        }

        // Check if number is divisible by more than 2 numbers
        if (cnt > 2) {
            is_prime = false;
            return;
        }

        // Otherwise, number is prime
        is_prime = true;
    }
};
```
In this SystemC code, the `IsPrime` module has two inputs and one output. The `n` input is used to determine whether the number is prime or not. The `is_prime` output is a Boolean variable that indicates whether `n` is prime or not.

In the `check_primeness` method, the program checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, and if so, outputs that `n` is not prime and exits. Otherwise, it checks if `n` is divisible by any number between 1 and `n`. If so, the counter `cnt` increments. If `n` is divisible by more than 2 numbers, the program outputs that `n` is not prime and exits. Otherwise, it outputs that `n` is prime.

To incorporate the signals `n` and `is_prime` into the module, we can modify the SystemC code as follows:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that checks whether a given number is prime
SC_MODULE(IsPrime) {
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<bool> is_prime;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(IsPrime) {
        // Process to check for primeness
        SC_METHOD(check_primeness);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Method to check primeness
    void check_primeness() {
        int cnt = 0;

        // Check if number is less than/equal to 1
        if (n <= 1) {
            is_prime = 0;
            return;
        }

        // Check for divisors from 1 to n
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

            // Check if number is divisible
            if (n == i)
                cnt++;
        }

        // Check if number is divisible by more than 2 numbers
        if (cnt > 2) {
            is_prime = 0;
            return;
        }

        // Otherwise, number is prime
        is_prime = 1;
    }
};
```
This SystemC code incorporates the signals `n` and `is_prime` into the `IsPrime` module as input and output ports, respectively. The inputs and outputs are declared using the `sc_in` and `sc_out` keywords, respectively.
