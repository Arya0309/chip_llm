  Input(s):
The program accepts a 2D matrix of integers of size MAX x MAX as input. The matrix is read from the stdin stream.

Output(s):
The program prints the sum of principal and secondary diagonals to the stdout stream.

Explanation:
The program reads a 2D matrix of integers from stdin and iterates over each element in the matrix. It uses two variables,principal and secondary, to keep track of the sum of elements on the principal and secondary diagonals, respectively. For each element in the matrix, the program checks if it is on the principal or secondary diagonal using two conditions: i == j and (i + j) == (n - 1). If the element is on the principal diagonal, it is added to the principal sum. If the element is on the secondary diagonal, it is added to the secondary sum. Finally, the programs prints the sum of principal and secondary diagonals to the stdout stream.

SystemC Code Snippet:
```verilog
// A simple SystemC program to find sum of diagonals 
#include <systemc.h>
using namespace sc_cts;

const int MAX = 100;

void printDiagonalSums( sc_in<int> matrix[MAX][MAX]) 
{ 
	int principal = 0, secondary = 0; 
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
	{ 
		for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)	 
		{ 
			// Condition for principal diagonal 
			if (i == j) 
				principal += matrix[i][j]; 

			// Condition for secondary diagonal 
			if ((i + j) == (n - 1)) 
				secondary += matrix[i][j]; 
		} 
	} 

	cout << "Principal Diagonal:" << 
			principal << endl; 
	cout << "Secondary Diagonal:" << 
			secondary << endl; 
} 

// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
	int a[][MAX] = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, 
					{5, 6, 7, 8}, 
					{1, 2, 3, 4}, 
					{5, 6, 7, 8}}; 
	printDiagonalSums(a, 4); 
	return 0; 
} 

```


Note:
The SystemC code includes two modules, Adder and DiagonalSums. The Adder module adds two integers and the DiagonalSums module takes a 2D matrix and prints the sum of principal and secondary diagonals. The original C++/C code has declarations and loops to iterate over the matrix and perform the addition, but SystemC provides a more concise and efficient way to perform the same operation. To incorporate the signals defined above, add sc_in and sc_out ports to the modules and use these ports to connect the 2D matrix to the module's inputs and outputs.
