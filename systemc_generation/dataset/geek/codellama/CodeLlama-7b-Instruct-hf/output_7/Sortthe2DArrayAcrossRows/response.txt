  Summary:
The provided C++/C code has a function named sortRowWise that takes two parameters as input - an array of integers of 2D called m, and two integers r and c, which refer to the number of rows and number of columns respectively. 

The second function in the code is main and it calls the first method (sorting) by passing dynamically allocated 2D array but not the number of rows and columns.

The first method (sortRowWise) sorts the rows of the 2D matrix with for loop & has several conditions and swapping logic.

After sorting, it then prints the sorted array line by line.

Overall, the code sorts the 2D array row-wise and then prints it.

Based on this summary, I'm going to provide a SystemC equivalent of the provided C++ code. However, please keep in mind that there may be slight differences between the original C++ code and the SystemC equivalent due to differences in implementation, synthesisability, and performance. Please also note that SystemC is not a language but a hardware and software description language, so the code generated is not native C++ code and may need additional modifications to be fully functional in C++.


SystemC Equivalent:
```
// SystemC code for the function sortRowWise

#include <systemc.h>

void sortRowWise(int m[][4], int r, int c) {
    int size = r * c; 
    int matrix[size];
    int idx = 0;
    for (int r = 0；r < rows； r++) {
        for (int c = 0; c < c; c++) {
            matrix[idx] = m[r][c];
            idx++;
        }
     }

    // sort the column in ascending order
    int temp;
    for (int c = 0; c < c - 1; c++) {
        for (int j = c + 1; j < c; j++) {
            if (matrix[c] > matrix[j]) {
                temp = matrix[c];
                matrix[c] = matrix[j];
                matrix[j] = temp;
            }
        }
     }
    // print the sorted matrix
    for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (int c = 0; c < c; c++) {
            cout << matrix[idx] << " ";
            idx++；
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
 }

 // SystemC equivalent of the main function
 int main() {
     int m[][4] = {{9, 8, 7, 1},
          {7, 3, 0, 2},
          {9, 5, 3, 2},
          {6, 3, 1, 2}};
     int c = sizeof(m[0]) / sizeof(m[0][0]);
     int r = sizeof(m) / sizeof(m[0]);
     sortRowWise(m, r, c);
     return 0;
 }
```
Now, the generated SystemC code has a single method (sortRowWise) that takes two parameters as input - an array of integers of 2D called m, and two integers r and c, which refer to the number of rows and number of columns respectively. 

Therefore, sortRowWise method sorts the rows of the 2D matrix with for loop and has several conditions and swapping logic.

After sorting, it then prints the sorted array line by line.

Here, sc_in/sc_out signals are used for the input('done' signal) and output('done' signal).
