  C++/C code to sort an array using the Selection Sort algorithm in SystemC.
Inputs: arr - an integer array, n - the size of the array, clk - the clock signal, start - the start signal
Outputs: done - an encapsulating of the output, d - the sorted array.
          In this SystemC implementation, input and output ports are allocated to represent these ports.

 Line by line and blockwise Explanation
**#include < bits/stdc++.h >** This in code block indicates that you are going to include a file named <bits/stdc++.h >. This file is usually found in Linux and is used in C++ programs because "bits/stdc++.h. By including this file, you can have access to use full set of functions and works in C++.

**using namespace std;** This expression indicates that additional reserved words for standard items are to be accepted in the current namespace. Following this rule, we can use the functions in the std library without specifying their namespaces.

### Voila, let's continue.... I have zoomed in to the function defintion and some research to help me understand it 
implementation of selection sort using C++
One of the easiest sorting algorithm, selection sort is a simple and reliable for providing quicksort. It has N2 operations, placing it in the less than linear time class.  

In this code section, the data structures in arrays are sorted in ascending order.

I have reviewed the index of the code and we have the below information.-
**int n** - n is a parameter passed to the selectionSort function, which is an integer that represents the number of elements in the array.
**int arr **- It is an pointer to an integer variable that holds the sorted array after the intialization.

I plan to start my analysis from the beginning of this code block, and move it down to a thorough explanation using the data structures in the system.

***void swap(int *xp, int *yp) 
{ 
	int temp = *xp; 
	*xp = *yp; 
	*yp = temp; 
}***

### This is a **empty function** with **two pointers**, xp and yp are called as parameter. It completed the such that once the pointers xp and yp both point to the same set of memory locations or site, it returns void fore it will swap the two integers.

**Note: Is this an empty function by passing the information of the dynamic memory?
This is a function that utilizes pointers and dynamic memory allocation/deallocation to accomplish the task of swapping the data stored at two memory addresses; therefore, it is highly advantageous over an analogous strategy of saving element information one by one to swap through function mimicry that mimics the same behavior.
Is this where we swap value of the integers? 
The function considers just two pointers (xp and yp) to be passed as execution time parameters, and compares these pointers to objectively decide that x and and geens across , instead of using random, V stamping methd by logic of the swappping in the case of analytical models.

void selectionSort(int arr[], int n) 
{ 
	int i, j, min_idx; 

**for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) ** - This data is reprented in the form of a for loop of which is executing seven consecutive instructions 

* this code sorts the elements accordingly: 
- N Pieces of data
- Swapping in memory locations


// One by one move boundary of unsorted portion

**** int i,j,min_idx;****
// For every i element in range of index j, check if a<b such that a is within the unsorted range.

**for (j = i+1; j < n; j++) ** - This line indicates that a for-loop has been introduced in the function. Also, notice that in selection sort method used in the code, the the first case goes from i.e., 0 through I until the n sinusoids-1 decomposition is satisfied.
// Find the minimum element in unsorted portion

**if  (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) ** - It sets up conditional statements to find the final sort so that the values equal will ensure the sorting. Such as 5 < 5, it does not perform any other operations
 
 min_idx = j; - it captures the current index value until a certain point and compares many indexes by referencing the binary tree.

// Swap the found minimum element in the unsorted portion with the first element.
**swap(&arr[min_idx], &arr[i]);** - The swap() function is called with 2 arguments pointing to elements of the same array. As discussed in the previus section, the swap(int*x,int* y) function doesn't return anything. Instead, the function takes two array indices rather than two integers.

// Repeat the same steps of removing the minimum location from the unsorted portion and placing it at the front of the proper location until everything is sorted.
**}** - The exit clause clearly indicates the end of this for loop when eliminated thanks to the function call for selection sort.

// Print the sorted array at the end for the driver program.
**return 0** - it returns the dynamic effect on the array to a well-defined point in the program.

### Summary:
![Code Snippet](Thinking.png)

- This code extracts the data from its array formally, which is the performance condition or selection procedure for processing within the program. Thus, we can understand that everything this procedure communicates is taking place in parallel. This activity involves pointers since we associate that it takes a portion of the array index (min_idx) and stores that value in the array index (i). Most notably, the code obtains the elements of array j by locally referencing it from the selection procedure. Growing thanks to targeting the particular location of the array to its memory address.

To summarise: The program conducts the sorting procedure specifically to the array with local indices but in a manner that is based in memory, namely from the dynamic pointer of the array addresses, to demonstrate a sequential sort followed by all local indicies pointing to that memory. It proves to allocate two memory segments and pointing to the use case qualifying for memory management showing that the array comes from dynamic memory in which sorting itself overcomes the speed test with dynamic elements after pointer separation.

 The single relevant output value in case of this is done, which points to a fully sorted array having declared memory for specialiness. Following these steps, the code has only one significant output value: done, which tracks the end status of the operation. This output also points to expressions changing in real-time. As an important piece of code, it attracts the plotter's general overview of the diagrammatic sequence of sizes and the data itself before printing the array values which in terms lay a lot of importance in the scheme for memory management.
