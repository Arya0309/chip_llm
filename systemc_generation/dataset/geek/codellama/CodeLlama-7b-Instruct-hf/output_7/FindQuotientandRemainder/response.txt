  Task: Generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet to the provided C++/C code that computes the quotient and remainder of two integers. The SystemC code should use the provided signals and be able to integrate seamlessly with the existing testbench.

Inputs:

* Two integers, Dividend and Divisor.

Outputs:

* The quotient (Quotient),
* The remainder (Remainder),
* An error (Error) flag if the divisor is zero.

Code Explanation:

The code starts by declaring variables for the dividend (Dividend), quotient (Quotient), divisor (Divisor), and remainder (Remainder).

The inputs are read using standard input (cin). The user is prompted to enter both the dividend and divisor.

If the divisor is 0, an error is generated and the program terminates.

If the divisor is non-zero, the quotient and remainder are calculated using the division and modulo operators. The outputs are printed to the standard output (cout).

SystemC Snippet:

// C++ program to find quotient and remainder
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Divider) {
    sc_in<int> Dividend;  // Input port for the dividend
    sc_in<int> Divisor;  // Input port for the divisor
    sc_out<int> Quotient;  // Output port for the quotient
    sc_out<int> Remainder; // Output port for the remainder
    sc_out<bool> Error;  // Output port for the error flag

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Divider) {
        // Process to perform the division
        SC_METHOD(divide);
        sensitive << Dividend << Divisor << Quotient << Remainder << Error;
    }

    // Method to calculate the quotient and remainder
    void divide() {
        if (Divisor.read() == 0) {
            Error.write(1);
        } else {
            Quotient.write(Dividend.read() / Divisor.read());
            Remainder.write(Dividend.read() % Divisor.read());
        }
    }
};

The SystemC code follows the same structure as the original C++/C code, with each input and output copied into the corresponding SystemC ports. The method (divide) processes the inputs and calculates the quotient and remainder according to the original logic.

In the constructor, the divide method is sensitized to all the input and output ports, and the sensitive signal is used to synchronize the simulation.
