  This is a C++/C program that rotates a matrix.

**Inputs:**

* Matrices of size R x C, which represent the input matrix that is to be rotated.

**Outputs:**

* Rotated matrix of size R x C.

**Details:**

The main function of the program is the `rotatematrix` function, which takes in three arguments: `m`, `n`, and `mat`, which represent the number of rows and columns, and the initial matrix to be rotated, respectively. 

The function then proceeds to perform the following operations:

1. Declare a `prev` and `curr` variable to store the values of the matrix elements being transferred.
2. Check if a row and column index is at the upper limit of the matrix. If so, break from the while loop.
3. Store the value of the first element of the next row in the variable `prev`.
4. Move the elements of the first row from the remaining rows to the previous row using the `for` loop.
5. Move the elements of the last column from the remaining columns to the previous columns using the `for` loop.
6. Move the elements of the last row from the remaining rows to the previous rows using the `for` loop.
7. Move the elements of the first column from the remaining rows to the previous rows using the `for` loop.
8. Print the rotated matrix.

The `main` function is used to test the `rotatematrix` function with two input matrices, which are defined as an array of size R x C. The function calls the `rotatematrix` function with the number of rows, number of columns, and the input matrix as arguments.

**Advice for the next reviewer:**

Provide a thorough explanation of the logic of the program, and consider adding diagrams or flowcharts to better represent the operation of the program. Additionally, ensure the code is correctly indented and lined up.
