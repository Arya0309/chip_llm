  **Question:** 
Given the following C++/C code, please provide a SystemC code equivalent that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow. Additionally, include a line-by-line or block-by-block natural language explanation of the provided SystemC code:
```
// C++ Program to find the transpose of a matrix
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std; 
#define N 4

// This function stores transpose of A[][] in B[][]
void transpose(int A[][N], int B[][N])
{
 int i, j;
 for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
     for (j = 0; j < N; j++)
         B[i][j] = A[j][i];
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
 int A[N][N] = {{1, 1, 1, 1},
                 {2, 2, 2, 2},
                 {3, 3, 3, 3},
                 {4, 4, 4, 4}};

 int B[N][N], i, j;

 transpose(A, B);
 cout << "Result matrix is \n";
 for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
 {
   for (j = 0; j < N; j++)
     cout << " " << B[i][j];
   cout <<"\n";
 }
 return 0;
}
```
**SystemC Code Equivalent**
```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that performs the matrix transpose operation
module transpose(
    sc_in<int> A[N][N], // Input port for the matrix A
    sc_out<int> B[N][N] // Output port for the transposed matrix B
)
{
    // Loop through each element of the matrix A and store
    // the transposed elements in the matrix B
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            B[i][j] = A[j][i];
        }
    }
}

// Module that takes the matrix A and the transposed matrix B as inputs and
// displays the resultant matrix
module display(
    sc_in<int> A[N][N], // Input port for the matrix A
    sc_in<int> B[N][N] // Input port for the transposed matrix B
)
{
    // Display the resultant matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            std::cout << " " << B[i][j];
        }
        std::cout << "\n";
    }
}

// Top-level module that instantiates the transpose and display modules
module top_level()
{
    sc_in<int> A[N][N], B[N][N];
    transpose t(A, B);
    display d(A, B);
}
```

**Explanation**:
The provided C++/C code defines a function to transpose a matrix and a driver code to test the function. The matrix A[N][N] is the input matrix and the output transposed matrix B[N][N] is stored in the output array B. The function transposes A via a nested for loop, where each element of A is stored in the column of B and each row of B is filled with the corresponding element of A. The driver code takes the input matrix A and the transposed matrix B as inputs and displays the resultant matrix.

The corresponding SystemC code equivalent has three modules: transpose, display, and top_level. The transpose module is the same as the function in the C++/C code, where the nested for loop is defined to transpose the elements of the matrix A. The display module is similar to the driver code in the C++/C code, where the resultant matrix B is displayed. The top_level module instantiates the transpose and display modules and provides the input and output signals for the transpose and display modules.

In the SystemC code, the input and output signals, A[N][N] and B[N][N], are defined as part of the transpose and display modules, respectively. The transpose and display modules are connected end-to-end to form the top-level module, which instantiates the transpose and display modules. The top-level module is an example of a top-level design in SystemC, which integrates the transpose and display modules to form a complete system.
