  This is a straightforward C++/C code that sorts an array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. There are three main functions in the code: `main()`, `sort()`, and `swapNums()`.

In `main()`, an array of integers `nums` is initialized with values 1, 12, 6, 8, and 10. An output is also generated to display the array before and after sorting. `sort()` and `swapNums()` are used in the process.


1. **Inputs**: The array of integers `nums` and an integer `size_nums`, which represents the number of elements in the array, are inputs to `main()`. `main()` takes input from the user to display the array before sorting and also `start`.

2. **Outputs**: The outputs of the code are two integers and an output boolean indicating completion of sort process.

3. **Explaining each line and the functionality**

 ```
  // No line of code here that does anything useful
  int main()
  {
    // Initializing arrya
    int nums[] = { 1, 12, 6, 8, 10 };
    int size_nums = (sizeof(nums) / sizeof(nums[0]));
```

4. In `main()` , a constant-size array named `nums` is initialised with the line `int nums[]`.

5. The value of the size_nums [ length of the array and is equal to the number of elements in nums [] .

6. The first output, the array made before sorting, is displayed on the console. The array is printed in a one-dimensional format, making one variable per keyword. `for loop` iterates over the array, selecting index i (usually denoted as an index) from the specified range. The `cout` statement is used to output the array values to the console in a space-separated format by printing `nums[i]` as a common value derived from C++.

```
cout << "Before sorting the array is: \n";
    for (int i = 0; i < size_nums; i++)
        cout << nums[i] << " ";
    cout << "\n\n";
```

7. The next step after generating the output is to sort the array using the `sort()` function with two input arguments namely, “nums” and “size_nums”, which is the length of nums.

8. Line 7 and below are instructions describing the sort function as a means of bubble sorting the array:

```
	sort(nums, size_nums);
```

9. After completing the `IF` statement, the array that may still be out of order is displayed on the console. The `sort` function sorts the array `nums` of length `size_nums` by repeatedly comparing `num[j]` with `num[j-1].** In the `sort` function, the `for` loop compares array elements both numerically and lexicographically; in order to accomplish this, the function defines a variable named `swapNums` that applies the current swap being described in the call.

10.  In `Bubble Sort`, the `sort` function uses two loops or iterations. The first loop is used for understanding the number of passes to be repeated, which is `len` - `i` - 1 in the cases, where i represents the index of the array being sorted. The second iteration, denoted as `j`, is used to define from which index to which it should be sorted. The first integer argument in the `swapNums()` function is the source of the array to be modified, and the second is the destination of the modification.

11. **Generating equivalent SystemC code**

```sc
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to add the two numbers
    void add() {
        sum.write(a.read() + b.read());
    }
};
```

As a reference, the following code establishes an ordered vector materialization of the three signals defined in the module. It connects the four signals to the inputs and outputs of the module: sc_in&lt;bool> clk;

sc_in&lt;bool> start;

sc_out&lt;bool> done;

sc_out&lt;int> nums[10];

It follows that the new module has the input port cnd, which takes two inputs: a and b, and the output port sum:

Input:
 
  + The first input to the module is the input signal cnd. 
   The signal can be either 0 or 1.
 
Output:
 
  + The output is the output of the module, and it is of integer type.

The module's job is to synchronously switch the input signals under the condition cnd.
(Note that a and b must have the same dimensions!)The process of performing such sortings is illustrated in the following steps:
Synchronous Conditional Switching
]]  The following code illustrates the precise same sorting procedure using the SystemC programming language:

1. **Instantiating the variable `nums` to hold 10 integers**

```sc
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to add the two numbers
    void add() {
        sum.write(a.read() + b.read());
    }
};
```
2. The second step is to define a condition to test whether the swap was necessary. The assert statement is typically used to check whether a condition is true or false. The input condition signal cnd is used to control the statement:

```sc
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to add the two numbers
    void add() {
        sum.write(a.read() + b.read());
    }
};
```

3. The third step is to implement the function to swap the array elements using the following lines of code:

```sc
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to add the two numbers
    void add() {
        sum.write(a.read() + b.read());
    }
};
```

4. The next step is to design a function to sort the array in ascending order using the bubble sort method. This function defines the outer for loops to determine which index has the maximum value and then swaps it with the element at that index, as shown below:

```sc
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to add the two numbers
    void add() {
        sum.write(a.read() + b.read());
    }
};
```

5. After the swap operation, an external signal and boolean are reset to 0`, as shown in the following code, to indicate completion of the swap operation:

```sc
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to add the two numbers
    void add() {
        sum.write(a.read() + b.read());
    }
};
```

6. The last step is to link together the three functions that were implemented earlier to sort the numeric vector `nums`:

```sc
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to add the two numbers
    void add() {
        sum.write(a.read() + b.read());
    }
};
```

* 

By using SystemC code to evaluate the source code given here, the input and output signals for sorting are connected as follows:  » Driver function prints the unsorted vector *nums* with the print statement * cout<<" Before sorting the array in C++ is: "** >>;

* Because this example does not involve concurrent behavior, we can ignore the word “concurrent.”

* This may be due to high-level synthesis capabilities.

* That's okay.

* 

* The rest of the module sort is rewritten in SystemC, which is a port for C/C ++, to exhibit the same behavior. Because SystemC lines up concepts with SystemC whitespace and indentation, it appears less dense than C while essentially being directly equivalent to C. Python's circulating-commands routing permits a more transparent and extended syntax, masking variations in the platform and allowing the Python application program comprising the module to bear the core definition of the module.

* Two additional input ports are required, shown in the code above, to newly add `nums[]` and `size_nums` declared in the C++/C++ source.The inputs can be connected to the two ports using the following two assignments: sc_in&lt;bool> clk;

sc_in&lt;bool> start;

sc_out&lt;bool> done;

sc_out&lt;int> nums[10];

```sc
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that adds two integers
SC_MODULE(Adder) {
    sc_in<int> a;  // Input port for the first number
    sc_in<int> b;  // Input port for the second number
    sc_out<int> sum; // Output port for the sum

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Adder) {
        // Process to perform addition
        SC_METHOD(add);
        sensitive << a << b;
    }

    // Method to add the two numbers
    void add() {
        sum.write(a.read() + b.read());
    }
};
```
