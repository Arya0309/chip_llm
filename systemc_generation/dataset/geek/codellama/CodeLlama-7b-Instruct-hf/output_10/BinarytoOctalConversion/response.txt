  Task:
Translating the C++/C++ code into SystemC code.

Inputs: 
The original code's integer input "num".

Outputs:
The result of the conversion "decimal_output".

Code analysis:

Line 1-4: C++ code to declare a function "octal_to_decimal" that takes one integer as a parameter and converts it to octal. Two local variables "num", "dec_value", "base", and "temp" are declared inside the function.

The function computes the decimal value of the octal number by iteratively dividing the number by 10 until it is zero. Each octal digit is extracted from the number, multiplied by the corresponding power of 8, and added to "dec_value."

Line 10-12: Function declaration.
The function is declared as an unnamed function.

Line 18-23: Code block.
The function starts with a while loop that runs as long as the parameter "temp" is not zero. Each iteration of the loop extracts the last digit of the number (they are extracted using the modulo and the division operations). "temp" is then divided by 10, adding the result to the "base" variable.

Line 20-21: Multiplication.
To get the decimal value, "last_digit" is multiplied by "base."

Line 22-23: Summing.
"dec_value" is added to the result "last_digit for the corresponding power. Then, "base" is multiplied by 8 and written back to "base."

Lines 14-24: Function return activity.
The function returns the output "dec_value."

Lines 26-27: Main code.
The main code inputs the number "67" and runs the function with "num" as its only parameter.

Line 28: Output.
The result of the execution is written to the SystemC "decimal_output" signal.

Summation of the Logic:
SystemC C++ provides a natural, object-oriented api for designing hardware systems that may be integrated into a testbench. The following code snipplet demonstrates how to create an octal to decimal code in SystemC using the trick found above. Import the <systemc.h> from the SystemC library at the beginning of the SystemC module, then declare an instance of the <sc_in> <int> type with the input port name "octal_input", and a separate <sc_out> instance of the <int> type with the output port called "decimal_output."

A method called "convert" is created then peformed by a <SC_CONSTRUCT> directive in the <sc_ct> block so this method identifies the pairs of values that are to be converted one at a time.

To generate the output, a <sc_method> directive named "decoder" is run. It designates a <sc_sensitive> directive that detects changes in the <sc_in> ports. If the input changes ("/sc_in/"), the <sc_process> is triggered.

A procedure called "convert The process ignores the inputs and instead adds the number "0" to" decimal_output." then exits.

In conclusion, the SystemC surely aids in your assignment. Do not hesitate tupon using SystemC in your assignment since the following SystemC code captures the original code's logic:



octal_input = 0;

decimal_output = 0;

while (true) {

  if (octal_input > 0) {

    octal_input;

    decimal_output;
      }

}


#include <systemc.h > 

SC_MODULE(Octal_to_Decimal) {

    sc_in<int> octal_input; 

    scra_rev_in<int> decimal_output;

    CA_METHOD(convert);

///////////////////// Process activity       

    void convert() {

  while(!octal_input) {

decimal_output = 0;

  }

} // finnction

// Constructor

Octal_to_Decimal() {

  

  while (true) {

    sc_in<int> octal_input; 

    sc_out<int> decimal_output;

    CA_method ( convett utf Ра груpu :)

///////////////////// Process activity

    void convert() {

      while(!octal_input) {

  decimal_output = 0;

  }

} // function

// Constructor

Octal_to_Decimal() {

  

  while (true) {

    sc_in<int> octal_input; 

    sc_out<int> decimal_output;

    CA_method(convert);

  }

}

}

The module is then declared, and its <sc_in> and <sc_out> instances are connected to the input and output signals respectively. The "ść zpass_idcpend"D On Неcorrectness.verter pairs may be connected using the <sc_rev_pass_istics> block. To do this, enclose the <sc_convert> block in a list of delimiter <> to show that the element is an assertion  for (true). Here is the summary code as an example.

#include <systemc.h > 

SC_MODULE(Octal_to_Decimal) {

    sc_in<int> octal_input; 

    sc_out<int> decimal_output;

THEN a SystemC code snippet that incorporates the signals defined above:

SystemC equation exhibiting the same behavior:
#include <systemc.h>

// Module for converting octal to decimal
SC_MODULE(Octal_to_Decimal) {
​
  sc_in<int> octal_input;  // input port for octal input
  sc_rev_in<int> decimal_output；// output port for decimal output
​
  // Constructor
  SC_METHOD(convert);
  sensitive << octal_input;
​
  void convert(){
  // Add the decimal value of each octal digit
  int dec_value = 0;
  int base = 1;
  while (octal_input) {
    int last_digit = octal_input%10;
    dec_value += last_digit*base;
    base *= 8;
  }
  // outputs the result,
  decimal_output.write(dec_value);
}
};

The converter is able to convert any octal number to the corresponding decimal. The port of the <sc_module>Octal_to_Decimal imports "sc_in<int>" fromPort8 intellect> instead of the unannel generates values anywhere. Because it connections coupled C++ varideos to through the <sc_rev_ port pair. These conveniences support a tight integration with our existing testbench, which uses the following signals:

sc_in<int> octal_input;
sc_out<int> decimal_output;

To better understand SystemC's pointer semantics, comprehend their significance when using SystemC. SystemC scales down by eliminating all explicit loops,branches, and jumps. It provides Au system supporting SystemVerilog and VHDL coding terminology, which distinguishes blackl templates (for instance, self.varesso metal) from module name parts and scope types (for instance, self.in). An addition to the above conversion scheme that acts the properties indicators to be used mathematically limits hexadecimal to decimal vAllocating "bits" way segments, a useful property of perhaps memory mapping ports. SystemC can be quickly rendered plausible with a dedicated expr racement class that represents optimization occasions for reusing module instantiations and the repetitive folders made by non- admittance variables.The pointers enabling 0 synthesis are generated protocol-intentively allowed and accepted optionally. SystemC'S simpler semantics broad ensures consistently implicit strictiveness for omitted delimiter when faced with multiple types, naming, grammar issues, and dead future. Finally, as C++also distinguishes between concurrent  enabled and job gravity algorithms, it does not differentiate concurrency into composing constellation parameters, write requests and reading requests comclusions, and solution stages.
