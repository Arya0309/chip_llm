  Inputs:

* v: a vector of integers
* target: an integer

Outputs:

* found: a boolean indicating whether the target was found in the vector

Functionality:

* The function binarySearch takes two inputs: a vector of integers (v) and a target integer (target).
* The function uses a loop to search for the target integer in the vector. The loop starts with low and high variables initialized to 0 and v.size()-1, respectively.
* The loop continues until low is greater than high or the target is found.
* Inside the loop, the mid point of the vector is calculated using the formula (high - low) / 2 + low. This formula is used to divide the vector into two halves, with the first half having values less than the target and the second half having values greater than the target.
* If the middle element of the vector is equal to the target, the function returns true, indicating that the target was found.
* Otherwise, the function continues to check whether the middle element is smaller or larger than the target and updates the low and high variables accordingly.
* Once the loop terminates, the function returns false if the target was not found.

In SystemC, this functionality can be replicated using the following code:

```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that implements binary search
SC_MODULE(BinarySearch) {
    sc_in<vector<int>> v;  // Input port for the vector
    sc_in<int> target;  // Input port for the target
    sc_out<bool> found; // Output port for the found flag

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(BinarySearch) {
        // Process to perform binary search
        SC_METHOD(search);
        sensitive << v << target;
    }

    // Method to perform binary search
    void search() {
        int low = 0, high = v->size() - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
            if (v->at(mid) == target) {
                found.write(true);
                return;
            } else if (v->at(mid) > target) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        found.write(false);
    }
};
```

Note that in SystemC, the `v` and `target` inputs are used directly in the `search` method through their ports, and the `found` output is written to using the `found.write()` method.
