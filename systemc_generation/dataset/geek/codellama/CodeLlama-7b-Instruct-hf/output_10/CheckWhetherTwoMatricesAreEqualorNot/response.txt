  Tasks:

1. Read and thoroughly analyze the provided C++/C code.
2. Identify the input(s) and output(s) of the code.
3. Provide a detailed, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language summary that explains:
   - The inputs and outputs of the code.
   - Each major line or block of code and its functionality (e.g., declarations, loops, conditions, data transformations).
4. Finally, based on your analysis, generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.

Provided Signals:
sc_in<int> A[SIZE];
sc_in<int> B[SIZE];
sc_out<bool> identical;

Summary:
The C++/C code is a function template that performs the following operations:

Inputs:

* A and B are two N x N matrices of integers.

Outputs:

* identical is a boolean value that indicates whether the two matrices are identical.

Functionality:

1. The function first declares two nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns of A and B.
2. The function then checks if the corresponding elements of A and B are equal. If they are not equal, the function returns 0 to indicate that the matrices are not identical.
3. If all elements of A and B are equal, the function returns 1 to indicate that the matrices are identical.

SystemC Code:

module areSame {
    input [N-1:0][N-1:0] A;
    input [N-1:0][N-1:0] B;
    output identical;

    always @* begin
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) begin
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) begin
                if (A[i][j] !== B[i][j]) begin
                    identical = 0;
                    break;
                end
            end
        end
    end
endmodule

In the SystemC code, the input and output signals are defined using the `input` and `output` keywords. The N x N matrices A and B are declared as `A[N-1:0][N-1:0]` and `B[N-1:0][N-1:0]`, respectively. The `always @*` block indicates the sensitive value and the code to be executed when it senses a change (e.g., the two matrices are not identical). The nested loops iterate over the rows and columns of A and B and check if the corresponding elements are equal. If any element is not equal, the `identical` output signal is set to 0. If all elements are equal, the `identical` output signal is set to 1.

Note:

1. Since the C++/C code is a function template, the SystemC code must also be a function template, with the same function signature.
2. The SystemC code must also define the `N` parameter, which determines the size of the matrices.
3. The SystemC code must also define a `cthread` that runs the `always @*` block.
