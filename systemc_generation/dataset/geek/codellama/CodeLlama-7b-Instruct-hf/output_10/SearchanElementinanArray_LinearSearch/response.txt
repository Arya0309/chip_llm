  Sure! Here is an explanation of the C++/C code you provided, along with an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic:

Inputs:

* A vector of integers, v
* A key value, key
* A vector of integers, data

Outputs:

* The index of the key value in the vector, i
* A value indicating whether the key was found or not, found

Explanation:

The code defines a function linearSearch that takes a vector v and a key value key as inputs, and returns the index of the key value in the vector if it is found, or -1 if it is not found. The function first searches the vector v for the key value, and if it is found, returns its index. If it is not found, it returns -1.

The main function first initializes the vector data with the values {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11}, and initializes the key value to 8. It then calls the linearSearch function using the vector data and key values, and stores the result in the variable i. If i is not -1, the code prints a message indicating that the key was found at position i+1. If i is -1, the code prints a message indicating that the key was not found.

SystemC Code:

Here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that captures the logic of the original C++/C code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(LinearSearch) {
    sc_in< vector<int> > v;  // Input port for the vector v
    sc_in< int > key;  // Input port for the key value
    sc_out< int > index;  // Output port for the index of the key
    sc_out< bool > found;  // Output port for whether the key was found or not

    SC_METHOD(search);
    sensitive << v << key;
    
    void search() {
        // Local variables to hold the size of the vector and the index of the key
        int size = v.size();
        int i = -1;
        
        // Loop over the elements of the vector
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            // If the key value is found in the vector, store its index in the output port
            if (v[i] == key) {
                i = i;
                index.write(i);
                found.write(true);
            }
        }
        
        // If the key value was not found in the vector, store -1 in the output port
        if (i == -1) {
            index.write(-1);
            found.write(false);
        }
    }
};
```
In the SystemC code, the module defines inputs for the vector v, key value, and output ports for the index and whether the key was found or not. The method search() is sensitive to the inputs v and key, and performs the linear search to find the key value in the vector. If the key value is found, the method writes its index in the output port index and sets the output port found to true. If the key value is not found, the method stores -1 in the output port index and sets the output port found to false.
