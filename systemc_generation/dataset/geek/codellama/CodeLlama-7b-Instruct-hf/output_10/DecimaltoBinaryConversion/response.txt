  The provided C++/C code is a function that converts a decimal number to its binary representation. The function takes an integer parameter, `n`, and outputs an array of integers that represent the binary representation of `n`.

The function works as follows:

1. It declares an array of 32 integers, `binaryNum`, to store the binary representation of `n`.
2. It initializes a counter, `i`, to 0.
3. It enters a while loop, where `n` is greater than 0.
4. It stores the remainder of `n` divided by 2 in `binaryNum[i]`.
5. It sets `n` to the result of dividing `n` by 2.
6. It increments `i`.
7. The loop repeats until `n` is 0.
8. It prints `binaryNum` in reverse order using a for loop.

The output of the function is the binary representation of `n`, stored in the `binaryNum` array.

Here is a natural language summary of the function:

The function `decToBinary` takes an integer parameter, `n`, and returns the binary representation of `n` as an array of integers. It does this by calculating the remainder of `n` divided by 2 until `n` is 0, storing each remainder in an element of an array. It then prints the array in reverse order.

Here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:

```c++
#include <systemc.h>

// Module for decimal to binary conversion
SC_MODULE(decToBinary) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;
    sc_out<int> binary_out;

    // Method to convert decimal to binary
    void convert() {
        // Array to store binary number
        int binaryNum[32];

        // Counter for binary array
        int i = 0;
        while (dec_in.read() > 0) {
            // Storing remainder in binary
            // array
            binaryNum[i] = dec_in.read() % 2;
            dec_in.read() = dec_in.read() / 2;
            i++;
        }

        // Printing binary array in reverse
        // order
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
            binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
    }
};
```

In the SystemC code, we have incorporated the signals defined above, `dec_in` and `binary_out`. The scanario is set up to run `convert()` when a new value is available on `dec_in`, and the resulting binary number is stored on `binary_out`.

The code is compilable and can be integrated with our existing testbench.
