  C++/C Code Summary:

This program takes an array of integers, copies its elements in the reverse order, and then prints both the original and the copy arrays. The input array is hardcoded in the example given, but it would be easily extended to take user input or perform matrix operations if this program were modified.

The program starts by including a string stream called 'stdio', which allows formatting input and output of data types. It then defines a function called 'printArray', which visualizes the given array and takes an integer array and its length as parameters.

In the code's main function, the original array is created by just copying an integer array, and its length is obtained with the help of the 'sizeof' operator and the division operator. Another integer array is defined and copied in a for loop with the same length, in which each element is set equal to a single point in reversed order by referencing original_arr. A call to the 'printArray' function is also made to check the original array.

Spencer's data arrays are then reversed and duplicated using another for loop and a reverse order index in a copied_arr array. An additional printArray function is also used to output the copied array.

To mimic this behavior in a SystemC program, the following outputs and inputs should be defined:
```scss
// Inputs
signal data; // input array
signal length; // length of array

// Outputs
signal out; // copied array

// C Functions
SC_MODULE(Copier) {
    sc_in<int> data; // input array
    sc_in<int> length; // length of array
    sc_out<int> out; // copied array

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Copier) {
        // Process to perform execution
        SC_METHOD(execute);
        sensitive << data << length;
    }

    // Method to execute the code
    void execute() {
        int copy_arr[length]; // new array
        int rev_ind= length-1;

        for (rev_ind; rev_ind >= 0; rev_ind--) {
            copy_arr[rev_ind] = data[rev_ind]; // in reverse order
        }

        out.write(copy_arr);
    }
};
```
