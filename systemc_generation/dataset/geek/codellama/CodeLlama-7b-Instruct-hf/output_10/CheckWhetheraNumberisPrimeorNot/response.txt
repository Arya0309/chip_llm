  The provided C++/C code is a simple prime number checker, which takes an integer `n` as input and outputs whether it is prime or not. The code uses a simple trial division method, where it checks if `n` is divisible by any number between 1 and `n` inclusive. If `n` is divisible by more than 2 numbers, it is not prime, otherwise it is prime.

The inputs of the code are the integer `n` and its corresponding output is a boolean value indicating whether `n` is prime or not.

Here is a line-by-line explanation of the code:

1. `int main() {`: This line starts the main function.
2. `int n = 29;`: This line declares an integer variable `n` and initializes it to 29.
3. `int cnt = 0;`: This line declares an integer variable `cnt` and initializes it to 0.
4. `if (n <= 1) `: This line checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, then it is not prime, so it prints "n is not prime" to the console.
5. `else {`: This line starts the else block, which is executed only if the previous if statement is not satisfied (i.e., `n` is greater than 1).
6. `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {`: This line starts a for loop that iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
7. `if (n % i == 0) {`: This line checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, then it increments `cnt`.
8. `cnt++;`: This line increments `cnt` by 1.
9. `}`: This line ends the if statement.
10. `if (cnt > 2) {`: This line checks if `cnt` is greater than 2. If it is, then it means that `n` is divisible by more than 2 numbers, so it prints "n is not prime" to the console.
11. `else {`: This line starts the else block, which is executed only if the previous if statement is not satisfied (i.e., `n` is divisible by 2 or less numbers).
12. `cout << n << " is prime" << endl;`: This line prints "n is prime" to the console.
13. `return 0;`: This line returns 0 to the calling function.
14. `}`: This line ends the main function.

Now, let's generate the equivalent SystemC code:
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(PrimeChecker) {
    sc_in<int> n;
    sc_out<bool> is_prime;

    SC_CTOR(PrimeChecker) {
        // Check if n is less than or equal to 1
        SC_METHOD(check_n);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    void check_n() {
        if (n <= 1) {
            // If n is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime
            is_prime.write(false);
        } else {
            // If n is greater than 1, check if it is prime
            SC_METHOD(check_prime);
            sensitive << n;
        }
    }

    void check_prime() {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        if (cnt > 2) {
            // If n is divisible by more than 2 numbers, it is not prime
            is_prime.write(false);
        } else {
            // Otherwise, it is prime
            is_prime.write(true);
        }
    }
};
```
This code, too, takes an integer `n` as input and outputs a boolean value indicating whether `n` is prime or not. The equivalent logic of the original C++/C code is implemented in the `check_prime()` method, which checks if `n` is divisible by any number between 1 and `n` inclusive. If `n` is divisible by more than 2 numbers, it is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.

The code uses the `sc_in<int>` and `sc_out<bool>` signals to communicate with the testbench.
