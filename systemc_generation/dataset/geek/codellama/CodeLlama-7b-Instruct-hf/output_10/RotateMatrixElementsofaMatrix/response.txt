  The provided C++/C code defines a function `rotatematrix` that rotates a square matrix of size `R x C`. The function takes in a 2D array `mat` of size `R x C` as its input. The function then modifies the input array by swapping elements in a particular manner to rotate the matrix. The function does not return any values and only modifies the input array.

The C++/C code can be summarized as follows:

1. The function `rotatematrix` takes two inputs: the dimension `R` of the input matrix `mat` and the number of columns in the input matrix `C`.
2. The function initializes two variables `row` and `col` to 0 and declares two temporary variables `prev` and `curr` to hold the elements of the matrix.
3. The function then enters a loop, where `row` and `col` are incremented alternately while `row` is less than `R` and `col` is less than `C`.
4. Inside the loop, the function performs four moves:

a. The function stores the first element of the next row, which is the element on the diagonal one row below and one column to the right, in the variable `prev`.

b. The function moves elements of the first row from the remaining rows to the last column of the current row.

c. The function moves elements of the last column from the remaining columns to the last row of the current column.

d. The function moves elements of the last row from the remaining rows to the first column of the current row.

5. After the loop terminates, the function prints the rotated matrix to the console.

The provided SystemC code snippet adapted to the logic of the original C++/C source can be as follows:

```c++
#include <systemc.h>
#define R 4
#define C 4

SC_MODULE(rotatematrix) {
    sc_in<int> in[R][C];
    sc_out<int> out[R][C];

    void rotatematrix() {
        int row = 0, col = 0;
        int prev, curr;

        while (row < R && col < C) {
            if (row + 1 == R || col + 1 == C) {
                break;
            }

            prev = in[row + 1][col];

            for (int i = col; i < C; i++) {
                curr = in[row][i];
                out[row][i] = prev;
                prev = curr;
            }
            row++;

            for (int i = R-1; i >= row; i--) {
                curr = in[i][C-1];
                out[i][C-1] = prev;
                prev = curr;
            }
            R--;

            for (int i = R-1; i >= row; i--) {
                curr = in[i][col];
                out[i][col] = prev;
                prev = curr;
            }
            col++;
        }
    }
};
```

In this SystemC code, the function `rotatematrix` takes in a 2D array `in` of size `R x C` and outputs a 2D array `out` of size `R x C`. The function modifies the input array `in` using the same logic as the original C++/C function.

Be sure that the SystemC code you provide faithfully captures the logic of the original C++/C source. Also, make your explanation thorough and accessible.
