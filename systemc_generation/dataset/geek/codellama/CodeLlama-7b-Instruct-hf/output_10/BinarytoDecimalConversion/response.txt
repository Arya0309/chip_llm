  Input(s):
- An unsigned integer n

Output(s):
- The decimal equivalent of the binary number n

Explanation:
`int binaryToDecimal(int n) ` is a function that takes an integer n as input and returns the decimal equivalent of n.

As line 7 explains, this function first initializes a variable named num to n, base (an integer), and a variable decimal_value (an integer) to store the decimal equivalent of n.

The function then starts a while loop that examines the decimal value stored in num and starts a conversational flowing. It completes a string of calculations that store the results in the decimal_value variable at each step.

As line 16 explains, the while loop exits when all the digits of the number have been converted to decimal.

As line 19 explains, the function returns the decimal_value variable.

Inputs:
The inputs of this code are the binary number to be converted to a decimal, which is supplied as an integer parameter, int.

Outputs:
The program outputs the decimal equivalent of the supplied binary number, which is returned to the user as a result of the functionâ€™s work, an integer.

Summary:
- The code takes an integer as input which is then sent as an input to the function tenStory().
- The tenStory function first converts the input binary number to a decimal.
- The program then accesses the results of this conversion and sends them to the user as an integer.

Here's an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and uses the provided testbench signals:

#include <systemc.h>

// Module that converts binary to decimal
SC_MODULE(Converter) {
    sc_in<int> binary_in;  // The input port for the binary number
    sc_out<int> decimal_out; // The output port for the decimal equivalent

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Converter) {
        // Process to perform conversion
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << binary_in;
    }

    // Method to convert binary to decimal
    void convert() {
        int num = binary_in.read();
        int decimalNum = 0;

        int base = 1;

        while (num > 0) {
            int lastDigit = num % 10;
            num /= 10;
            decimalNum += lastDigit * base;
            base *= 2;
        }

        decimal_out.write(decimalNum);
    }
};
```

In this SystemC code, we make use of the provided testbench signals that connect to the input and output ports of the Converter module. The module's process (convert()) behaves equivalent to the C++ code.
