**Explanation**:

The provided C++/C code calculates the average of an array of integers. The code has two functions: one to calculate the average and the other to calculate the sum of the array. The `average` function calculates the average of the array by dividing the sum of the array elements by the length of the array (i.e., the number of elements). The `main` function uses the `average` function to print the average of an array.

**SystemC Code**:

Below is the SystemC code that calculates the average of an array of integers, incorporating the `data_in` and `average_out` signals.

```scss
import <systemc.h>;

module calculator: {
    sc_in<double> average_out;
    sc_vector<sc_in<int>> data_in;

    // Calculate the sum of the array
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < data_in.size(); i++)
        sum += data_in[i].read();

    // Calculate the average of the array
    average_out.write((double)sum / data_in.size());
};
```

The `calculator` module takes in two signals: `data_in` and `average_out`. The `data_in` signal is a vector of integers, and the `average_out` signal is a double. The `calculator` module calculates the sum of the elements in the `data_in` vector and then calculates the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the vector (i.e., the length of the vector). The calculated average is then written to the `average_out` signal.

The SystemC code uses the `data_in` and `average_out` signals to propagate data between the C++/C code and the SystemC code. The `data_in` vector is used to transmit the array of integers to the `calculator` module, and the `average_out` signal is used to receive the calculated average from the `calculator` module.
