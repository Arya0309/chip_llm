  C++ program to multiply two matrices

This C++ program multiplies two matrices and prints their product. The input matrices are represented as 2D arrays, and the number of rows and columns in each matrix is specified by the R1, C1, R2, and C2 macros. The resulting matrix is represented as a 2D array, and its number of rows and columns are determined by the number of rows and columns of the two input matrices, respectively.

The code first checks that the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix, and then multiplies the two matrices elementwise. The resulting matrix is then printed.

Inputs:

* mat1 is a 2D array of size R1 x C1, representing the first matrix.
* mat2 is a 2D array of size R2 x C2, representing the second matrix.

Outputs:

* C is a 2D array of size R1 x C2, representing the product of the two matrices.

Code walkthrough:

1. The program starts with the definition of some constants and macros. The R1, C1, R2, and C2 macros specify the dimensions of the two input matrices.
2. The mulMat function is defined. This function takes two 2D arrays as inputs, representing the two matrices to be multiplied. It returns a 2D array representing the product of the two matrices.
3. The function first declares a 2D array called rslt, which will hold the resulting matrix.
4. The function then prints a message declaring that the multiplication is being performed.
5. The function then iterates through the rows and columns of the two input matrices, and for each element in the product, it adds the corresponding elements in the two input matrices.
6. The function then prints the resulting matrix.
7. The main function is then called, which calls the mulMat function and prints the resulting matrix.

SystemC Translation:
```scss
// SystemC code to multiply two matrices

#include <systemc.h>

// Module that performs matrix multiplication
SC_MODULE(MatMult) {
    // Input ports
    sc_in<int> A[SIZE_A];
    sc_in<int> B[SIZE_B];

    // Output ports
    sc_out<int> C[SIZE_RESULT];

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MatMult) {
        // Process to perform multiplication
        SC_METHOD(multiply);
        sensitive << A << B;
    }

    // Method to perform multiplication
    void multiply() {
        // Initialize result matrix
        int rslt[R1][C2];

        // Print multiplication message
        cout << "Multiplication of given two matrices is:\n";

        // Iterate through rows and columns of input matrices
        for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                // Initialize running total for element in result matrix
                int total = 0;

                // Iterate through rows of second input matrix
                for (int k = 0; k < R2; k++) {
                    // Add product of elements in corresponding rows
                    total += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
                }

                // Write result to result matrix
                C[i][j] = total;

                // Print result element
                cout << C[i][j] << "\t";
            }

            // Print result row
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
};
```

In this SystemC code, the inputs and outputs are defined using SystemC signals, which are similar to C++ pointers. The multiply method performs the matrix multiplication elementwise, and writes the result to the result matrix C. The code then prints the resulting matrix.

Note that the SystemC code incorporates the signals defined above, so it can seamlessly integrate with our existing testbench.
