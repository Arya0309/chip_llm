  The provided C++/C code is a simple sorting algorithm that sorts a 2D matrix row-wise. The input to the code is a 2D matrix represented as a square 2D array `m`, with rows `m[i]` and columns `m[i][j]`. The output is also a 2D matrix with the same dimensions, but with the elements sorted in ascending order within each row.

The first block of code defines a helper function called `swap` that takes two integer pointers `xp` and `yp` as input and swaps their values.

The second block of code defines the `sortRowWise` function, which takes a 2D matrix `m`, row dimension `r`, and column dimension `c` as input. The function sorts the matrix row-wise by comparing each element in the current row with the next element, and swapping the elements if necessary. This process is repeated until the entire matrix is sorted.

The third block of code defines the `main` function, which creates a 2D matrix `m` and initializes it with some values. It then calls the `sortRowWise` function with the matrix, row, and column dimensions as input. Finally, the function prints the sorted matrix.

The provided SystemC code should be used in a high-level synthesis flow and should incorporate the signals defined above. The output of the non-blocking assignments of SystemC code must be converted to a Verilog/RTL. The output of the Verilog/RTL must be converted to an initial hardware bitstream.

Here is a SystemC code that shows the ability of synthesizable SystemC code to hold consecutive adjacent transitions within a data register a number of consecutive adjacent transitions, while the input signal resets the timer:
```scss
module ClockDivider
import SystemC;

// Internal data
bool timer = false;
int count = 0;

// inputs
in_bool clk;         // input signal
in_bool reset;       // reset input signal

out_bool divider_out  // counter output
divider_out(posedge clk/reset) = (timer) ? timer: timer#c.clock_divider; count++;     
}
ClockDivider::ClockDivider : body(){}

module ClockGate
import SystemC;

// Internal data
bool global_reset = false;

// inputs
in_bool  clk;         // input signal
in_bool  divider_out;         // input signal
in_bool  reset;       // reset input signal

out_bool gate_out  // counter output
gate_out(posedge clk/reset /global_reset) = (divider_out == 0) ? (!global_reset) ? gate_out(posedge clk) = true : false : false;
}
ClockGate::ClockGate: body(){}

module ClockDividerExt
import SystemC;

// Internal data
bool global_reset = false;

// inputs
in_bool  clk;         // input signal
in_bool  reset;       // input signal

out_bool divider_out  // counter output
divider_out(posedge clk/reset) = (global_reset) ? !(gate_out_signal(posedge clk)) : divider_out(:c.clock_divider);
}
ClockDividerExt::ClockDividerExt::body(){}
```
