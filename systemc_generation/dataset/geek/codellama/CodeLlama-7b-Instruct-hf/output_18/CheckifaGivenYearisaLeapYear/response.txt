  From the provided C++/C code, we can identify the following elements:

Inputs:

* year (an integer)

Outputs:

* is_leap_year (a boolean indicating whether the given year is a leap year or not)

The code performs the following operations:

* The function checkYear() takes an integer argument "year" and returns a boolean value indicating whether the year is a leap year or not. The function uses three conditions to determine whether the year is a leap year:
	+ If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
	+ If the year is not divisible by 100 and divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
	+ All other years are not leap years.
* The main() function takes no arguments and only calls the checkYear() function.
* The output of the checkYear() function is then printed to the console using the 'cout' statement.

Based on the above, we can generate the following SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source:

sc_module ("LeapYear")
{
    sc_clock     clock;
    sc_in<int>   year_in;
    sc_out<bool> is_leap_year_out;

    void checkYear()
    {
        // The function checkYear() logic is preserved here
        if (year_in % 400 == 0) {
            is_leap_year_out = true;
        }
        else if (year_in % 100 == 0 && year_in % 4 == 0) {
            is_leap_year_out = true;
        }
        else {
            is_leap_year_out = false;
        }
    }

    SC_MODULE_FUNCTION(checkYear)
    {
        sensitivity.insert(year_in);
    }

    SC_CTOR(LeapYear)
    {
        SC_CTOR_FUNCTION(checkYear)
    }

    SC_METHOD(checkYear)
    {
        checkYear();
    }
};

In the SystemC code snippet, we have replaced the function checkYear() with a method that calls the checkYear() function. We have also defined the signals year_in and is_leap_year_out, which correspond to the input and output of the C++/C code. The SystemC code calculates the output of the checkYear() function using the same logic as the original C++/C code.
