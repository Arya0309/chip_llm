  Modified C + +/C Program to Find the LCM of Two Numbers:

The previous C++/C code finds the LCM of two numbers by using an if statement and a while loop. The inputs are the two numbers a and b, and the output is the LCM. The while loop is used to find the maximum number, and the if block checks if the number is divisible by both of the input numbers.

SystemC Equivalent:
```c++
#include <systemc>
using namespace sc_core;

// Declare LCM result as input signal
sc_in <int> lcm_result;

// Calculate LCM of a and b and assign to output signal
lcm_result = a % b == 0 && a % b == 0 ? a : b;
```
In the previous example, `lcm_result` is used as the output signal for the LCM result. The calculation of the LCM can be performed by taking the modulo of both numbers with the other number, and if the result is divisible by both numbers, the given number is the LCM. Note that the `sc_in` signal used is `lcm_result`.

Overall, the SystemC code captures the same logic and behavior from the given C++/C source code. To successfully integrate the SystemC code into the testbench, you would need to also provide the correct signals that the SystemC code utilizes, such as the `lcm_result` and the `a` and `b` inputs.
