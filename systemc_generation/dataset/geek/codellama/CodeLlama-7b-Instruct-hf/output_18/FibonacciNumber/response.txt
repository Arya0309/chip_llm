  To understand the provided C++/C code, we must analyze its inputs, outputs, and operations.

**Inputs:** The code takes a single input `n` as a non-negative integer, which is used to generate the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

**Outputs:** The code outputs the generated Fibonacci number.

**Operation:** The code applies the Fibonacci sequence algorithm to generate the `n`-th Fibonacci number. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms. The algorithm uses two variables to store the previous two terms, and iteratively calculates the next term using the formula `curr = prev1 + prev2`. The algorithm stops when `i` reaches the input `n`.

Based on this understanding, here is a SystemC code snippet that captures the logic of the original C++/C source and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:

```scss
// SystemC code to find the n-th Fibonacci number

#include <systemc.h>

// Input port for the input n
sc_in<int> n;

// Output port for the Fibonacci number
sc_out<int> result;

// State machine that computes the Fibonacci sequence
SC_MODULE(Fibonacci) {
    // Declare two variables to store the previous two Fibonacci numbers
    int prev1, prev2;

    // Declare a counter variable to keep track of the current term
    int curr;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Fibonacci) {
        // Initialize the previous two Fibonacci numbers to 0 and 1
        prev1 = 1;
        prev2 = 0;
        curr = 0;

        // Add a process to calculate the next Fibonacci number
        SC_METHOD(calculate);
        sensitive << n;
    }

    // Process to calculate the next Fibonacci number
    void calculate() {
        if (n.read() <= 1) {
            // If n <= 1, return n
            curr = n.read();
        } else {
            // Calculate the next Fibonacci number using the formula
            curr = prev1 + prev2;
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = curr;
        }
        result.write(curr);
    }
};
```

This SystemC code includes the following components:

* An input port `n` for the input integer `n`.
* An output port `result` for the output integer `fib(n)`.
* A state machine `Fibonacci` that computes the Fibonacci sequence. The state machine has three variables: `prev1`, `prev2`, and `curr`. These variables are initialized to 0 and 1, and are used to store the previous two Fibonacci numbers and the current term, respectively. The state machine contains a process `calculate` that calculates the next Fibonacci number using the formula `curr = prev1 + prev2; prev2 = prev1; prev1 = curr;`. The output `result` is assigned the value of `curr`.
