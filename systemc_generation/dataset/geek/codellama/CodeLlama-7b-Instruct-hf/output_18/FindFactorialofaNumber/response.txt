  **Input(s) and Output(s)**:

The provided C++/C code performs the factorial calculation of a given number. The inputs to the code are an integer variable `num` that represents the number for which the factorial is to be calculated, and the outputs are an integer variable `res` that represents the result of the factorial calculation.

**Line-by-Line Explanation**:

1. The first line `#include <iostream>` imports the standard input/output library, allowing us to use the `cout` and `cin` functions.
2. The second line `#include <iostream>` imports the standard library containing the `factitional` function, which calculates the factorial of a given number.
3. The third and fourth lines `using namespace std;` and `using namespace std;` declare the `cin`, `cout`, and `factitional` functions that are part of the standard library.
4. The fifth line `int main()` is the entry point of a C++ program. It is marked as `int` because the function will return an integer value upon execution.
5. The sixth line `int num = 5;` declares the input `num`, which represents the number for which the factorial is to be calculated.
6. The seventh line `cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;` uses the `cout` function to print a message to the console indicating that the factorial of `num` is being calculated, followed by the actual calculation of the factorial using the `factitional` function and the output of that calculation being printed to the console.
7. The eighth line `return 0;` is the return statement that will exit the program with a return code of zero, signifying success.

**Equivalent SystemC Code**:

The following SystemC code is equivalent to the provided C++/C code and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow:
```systemc
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(Factorial) {
    sc_in<int> num; // Input port for the number to calculate the factorial of
    sc_out<int> res; // Output port for the calculated factorial

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Factorial) {
        // Process to calculate the factorial
        SC_METHOD(calculateFactorial);
        sensitive << num;
    }

    // Method to calculate the factorial
    void calculateFactorial() {
        int i, res;
        res = 1;
        for (i = 2; i <= num.read(); i++) {
            res *= i;
        }
        res = res.read();
        res.write(res);
    }
};
```
**Input(s) and Output(s)**:

The provided SystemC module takes in a signed integer `num` as input and calculates its factorial. The output of the module is an unsigned integer `res` that represents the factorial of the input `num`.

**Line-by-Line Explanation**:

1. The first line `#include <systemc.h>` imports the SystemC library, which is required to synthesize the code.
2. The second line `SC_MODULE(Factorial)` defines the module that calculates the factorial of a given number.
3. The third line `sc_in<int> num;` declares an input port `num` that takes in a signed integer.
4. The fourth line `sc_out<int> res;` declares an output port `res` that will output the calculated factorial of the input `num`.
5. The fifth line `SC_CTOR(Factorial)` is the constructor of the module, which calls the `calculateFactorial` method.
6. The sixth line `SC_METHOD(calculateFactorial);` declares a method `calculateFactorial` that will be called inside the constructor.
7. The seventh line `sensitive << num;` declares that the `calculateFactorial` method is sensitive to changes in the `num` input port.
8. The eighth line `void calculateFactorial() {` starts the implementation of the `calculateFactorial` method.
9. The ninth line `int i, res;` declares two local variables `i` and `res` that will be used in the loop.
10. The tenth line `res = 1;` initializes `res` to 1, which is the base case for the factorial calculation.
11. The eleventh line `for (i = 2; i <= num.read(); i++)` begins an integer loop that starts at 2 and continues until the value of `num` is reached.
12. The twelfth line `res *= i;` performs a multiplication of `res` by `i`, which will result in the calculation of the factorial.
13. The thirteenth line `res = res.read();` reads the value of `res` due to the previous multiplication.
14. The fourteenth line `res.write(res);` writes the calculated factorial back to the output port `res`.
15. The fifteenth line `}` ends the implementation of the `calculateFactorial` method.

**Additional Notes**:

- In the SystemC code, we use the `sc_in<int> num` and `sc_out<int> res` ports to connect the input and output of the module, respectively.
- The `sensitive << num` statement in the constructor makes sure that the `calculateFactorial` method is called whenever there is a change in the value of the input `num`.
- The `void calculateFactorial() {` statement is the beginning of the implementation of the `calculateFactorial` method.
- The `res = 1;` statement initializes `res` to 1, which is the base case for the factorial calculation.
- The `for (i = 2; i <= num.read(); i++)` statement begins an integer loop that starts at 2 and continues until the value of `num` is reached.
- The `res *= i;` statement performs a multiplication of `res` by `i`, which will result in the calculation of the factorial.
- The `res = res.read();` statement reads the value of `res` due to the previous multiplication.
- The `res.write(res);` statement writes the calculated factorial back to the output port `res`.
- The `}` statement at the end of the implementation of the `calculateFactorial` method ends the method.
