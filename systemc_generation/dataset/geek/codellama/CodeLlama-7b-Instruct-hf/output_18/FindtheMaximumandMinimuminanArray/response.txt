  Using the C++/C code provided:

1. Inputs:
The provided C++/C code takes an array of integers named `arr` as input and an integer `n` representing the size of the array.
2. Outputs:
The code outputs two integers, `min_val` and `max_val`, representing the minimum and maximum elements of the input array, respectively.
3. Summary:
The code basically finds the minimum and maximum elements of an array of integers and outputs them.

Block-by-block explanation:

1. The `getMin()` and `getMax()` functions are defined to return the minimum and maximum element of a given array, which is then passed into the `main()` function.
2. In the main function, the array `arr` is initialized and the size of the array is determined by the constant `n`.
3. The minimum and maximum elements are found using the `getMin()` and `getMax()` functions, and the output is printed to the console.
4. The `getMin()` and `getMax()` functions are defined as follows:
* `getMin()`: Returns a pointer to the smallest element of the array, which is equivalent to the minimum element.
* `getMax()`: Returns a pointer to the largest element of the array, which is equivalent to the maximum element.
5. The functions use `std::min_element()` and `std::max_element()`from the standard library to find the minimum and maximum elements, respectively.
6. The functions return pointer to the minimum or maximum element of the array, respectively. These pointers are then passed as arguments to the `cout` statements in the main function to print the desired values to the console.

Translation to SystemC:

Here is the SystemC translation of the C++/C code:

```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that implements getMin and getMax functions
SC_MODULE(MinMax) {
    sc_in<int*> arr; // Input port for the array
    sc_in<int> n; // Input port for the size of the array
    sc_out<int*> min_val; // Output port for the minimum element
    sc_out<int*> max_val; // Output port for the maximum element

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(MinMax) {
        // Process to find minimum and maximum elements of the array
        SC_METHOD(min);
        SC_METHOD(max);
        // The following lines of code are equivalent to the lines
        // of code from the C++/C code.
        sensitive << arr << n;
        min_val = &std::min_element(arr.read(), arr.read() + n);
        max_val = &std::max_element(arr.read(), arr.read() + n');
    }

    // Method to find the minimum element of the array
    void min() {
        min_val.write(std::min_element(arr.read(), arr.read() + n));
    }

    // Method to find the maximum element of the array
    void max() {
        max_val.write(std::max_element(arr.read(), arr.read() + n'));
    }
};
```

In the SystemC code, we have a module called `MinMax` that defines two input ports `arr` and `n`, and two output ports `min_val` and `max_val`. The module also declares two methods `min()` and `max()`, which correspond to the `getMin()` and `getMax()` functions in the C++/C code, respectively.

The `min()` and `max()` methods are implemented using the `std::min_element()` and `std::max_element()` functions from the Standard Template Library (STL) to find the minimum and maximum elements of the input array, respectively.

The two output variables `min_val` and `max_val` store pointers to the minimum and maximum elements of the array, respectively.

Finally, the `MinMax` module is constructed in the `main()` function using the `SC_CTOR` method, which initializes the input ports, outputs, and method definitions of the module.
