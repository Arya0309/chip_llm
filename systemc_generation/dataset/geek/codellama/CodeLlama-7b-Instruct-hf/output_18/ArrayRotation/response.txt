  This C++/C code source file demonstrates an array rotation algorithm that allows for the rotation of an array by a given number of items. The array's length is read from user input, and the program then reads the number of items to rotate, the array's elements, and the rotated array.

The input(s) of this code are as follows:

- An array's length read from user input
- Truncate the number of items to rotate
- The elements of the array, which will be rotated.
  
The output(s) of this code are as follows:

- A rotated array after a significant quantity of values are shifted.
