  Given the provided C++/C code, the inputs and outputs are:

* Inputs:
	+ `v`: a vector of integers
	+ `target`: an integer to be searched in the vector
* Outputs:
	+ `found`: a boolean indicating whether `target` is found in `v` or not

The code performs an iterative binary search on the array `v` to find whether it contains the target integer `target`. The code will search the vector `v` incrementally until it finds the target or the entire vector has been searched through.

The block of code that implements the binary search is:
```c
  // Defining the part of the vector to be
  // searched
int low = 0, high = v.size() - 1;
  
  // Till the element is found or vector cannot
  // be divided into more parts
while (low <= high) {
  
      // Finding mid point
  int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;

  // If the middle element is equal to target
  if (v[mid] == target) {
      return true;
  }

  // If the middle element is greater than 
  // target, search in the left half 
  if (v[mid] > target)
      high = mid - 1;
  
  // If the middle element is smaller than
  // target, search the right half 
  else
      low = mid + 1;
}
  
// If we don't find the target
return false;
```
This block uses a binary search algorithm to search the vector `v` for the target integer `target`. It works by repeatedly dividing the vector into two parts until the target is found or the entire vector has been searched. The code starts at the beginning of the vector and repeatedly searches the left and right half of the vector until the target is found or the entire vector has been searched.

In terms of inputs and outputs, the code takes in the vector `v` and the target integer `target` as input, and it outputs a boolean indicating whether the target is found in the vector or not.

Here is a SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the original C++/C code:
```c
#include <systemc.h>

// Binary search sc_module
SC_MODULE(BinarySearch) {
	// Inputs
	sc_in<int> v[N]; // Vector of integers
	sc_in<int> target; // Target integer to be searched

	// Output
	sc_out<bool> found;

	// Constructor
	SC_CTOR(BinarySearch) {
		// Process to perform binary search
		SC_METHOD(binarySearch);
		sensitive << v << target;
	}

	// Binary search function
	void binarySearch() {
		int low = 0, high = N - 1;
		while (low <= high) {
			int mid = ((high - low) / 2) + low;
			if (v[mid] == target) {
				found.write(true);
				return;
			}
			if (v[mid] > target)
				high = mid - 1;
			else
				low = mid + 1;
		}
		found.write(false);
	}
};
```
This SystemC code snippet uses a `sc_module` to implement the binary search algorithm. It takes in three inputs:

+ `v`: an array of integers to be searched
+ `target`: the target integer to search for
+ `N`: the size of the array `v`

It has one output:

+ `found`: a boolean indicating whether the target is found in the array or not

The `binarySearch()` function performs the binary search algorithm on the input vector `v`, starting at the beginning and repeatedly dividing the vector into two parts until the target is found or the entire vector has been searched. If the target is found, the `found` output is set to `true`, and the function returns. Otherwise, the `found` output is set to `false`.
