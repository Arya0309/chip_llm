  Your task is to show how to convert the following C++ code into SystemC code.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Driver code
int main()
{
    int a = 2, b = 3;

    cout << "Before swapping a = " << a << " , b = " << b
         << endl;

    // temporary variable
    int temp;

    // appying swapping algorithm
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
    cout << "After swapping a = " << a << " , b = " << b
         << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

There are two primary inputs of the C++ code you provide: 

* Variable a: This integer variable stores value 2.
* Variable b: This variable integer stores value 3.

The outputs of this program include:

* Console output: To convey the before and after swapping, including the `a` and `b` variables.

To realize the same behavior with SystemC code, we can create the following modules:

1. `simple_swap`: This module behaves in the same way as the C++ code you provided. It takes input values; it switches the input values; then it prints the swapped values. Notice that this module takes a)`sc_in` and input b`; the module `sc_in` ,`sc_in`; and output values; the module `.
2. `main`: This module is used to test the simple_swap submodule. It begins by creating objects of type simple_swap for input values and output values: 

```cpp
simple_swap<int> SS;   // create SS using C++ int class
systemc::sc_int<int> a;  /*declares a as type `int'*/
systemc::sc_int<int> b;  /*declares`b' as type `int'*/
// Subtarget ports for simple_swap: inputs (a, b), outputs (a, b)
void
subtarget() {
if (sc_bigint sheaf() - queue.size() == 0
            && alexa_Ahmedtaskbills_subsequential Snow_quota_too2016 = false) {
            // First print statement using the swapped values:
            cout "+-----------------------------------" << endl;
            cout "| After swapping a = " << a.read() << " , b = " << b.read()
                 << endl;
```

This creates instances of each variable `a` and `b`; additionally, for simplicity, it simplifies the input and output of the `simple_swap` method to type int. 

The next step is to integrate the `simple_swap` module with the `cout` object. To print values on the Standard Output, we set the method `ss.method()` to get the values of `a` and `b`. As discussed early on, SystemC supports C/C++ code, plus small additions such as declarations and new method calls that behave like SystemC processes.

The following SystemC code captures the logic of the original `a` and `b` variables:
```cpp
int 
main()
 {
    //create SS using our simple_swap class
simple_swap<int> SS;   // create SS using C++ int class
systemc::sc_int<int> a;  /*Declares type int a*/  
systemc::control_int<int>>  <int> b;  /* Declares type int*/  
//subtarget ports for simple_swap: inputs (a,b), Outputs (a,b)  
void _SS_SS(sc_int a_, sc_int b_) {
    // performs addition
    a = a_ << b_; 
}

//subtarget ports for simple_swap:inputs(a,b), Outputs(a,b)  
void SV_SV() {
    //test the variable a 
    cout+ "------------------------------------------------"; 
    cout "| Before swapping a = " <<sa.read() << " , b = "<< sb.read() 
                     << endl;
    
    //applies swapping algorithm
    int<int> t = a;   
    a = b;
    b = t; 
    //test the variable b  
    cout "+-----------------------------------------------"; 
    cout "| After swapping a = " << a.read() << " , b = " << b.read() 
                     << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
We can depict procedure calls to complicated functions as SystemC methods. ` 
text_bold(1, "Console output")`

This program swaps the values of variable `a` and `b` by establishing temporary storage in variable `t`.  To really test the input and output of the module, we can change the SystemC variables `a` and `b` to pass integers (note that `a` and `b` are defined as using integer) that can be used in simulation.

As described in the instructions, initially, a`sc_in` and a`sc_in` are defined as integers because the methods take values that are of this integer type. In addition, some output ports are created to transfer the input values to use with the subprogram Swift.

Similarly to the C++ account code, we can view the program's behavior by printing the before and after swapping stations.
