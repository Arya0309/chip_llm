  This is a typical C++/C program to find the quotient and remainder of two integers. The program takes in two integers, Dividend and Divisor through I/O, and outputs the quotient and remainder. The program utilized the modulus operator (%) to calculate the remainder and the division operator (/) to calculate the quotient. The program also has checks for division by zero. 

The natural language interpretation of the C++/C code is as follows:
The snippet enables users to obtain the quotient and remainder by dividing the provided dividend by the given divisor using the C++ operator: the program reads input initiated from the command line, computes the quotient and remainder resulting from the division by the given divisor, and then displays the quotient and remainder. The results are then displayed on the screen. If the divisor is zero, the program will then print an error message. If not, the program will perform the division and display the quotient. There is no output or input argument given.

The equivalent SystemC code is represented below: 

#include <systemc.h> //declares the systemC library

// Module to find quotient and remainder
SC_MODULE(QuotientandRemainder) {

    // Declare input ports
    sc_in<int> dividend;
    sc_in<int> divisor;
    
    // Declare output ports
    sc_out<int> quotient;
    sc_out<int> remainder;
    
    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(QuotientandRemainder) {
        // Process to find quotient and remainder
        SC_METHOD(findQuotientandRemainder);
        sensitive << dividend << divisor;
    }

    // Method to find quotient and remainder
    void findQuotientandRemainder() {
        quotient.write(dividend.read() / divisor.read());
        remainder.write(dividend.read() % divisor.read());
        
        // Print error message if divisor is zero
        if (divisor == 0) {
            cout << "Error: Divisor cannot be zero." << endl;
        }
    }
};

You can substitute the single integer declared inside the SC_MODULE block for multiple integers to enable you to specify different numeric inputs unless there is an error detected.
