  Inputs:

1. Two complex numbers, real1 and real2, represented by the std::complex<int> class.
2. Two booleans, imag1 and imag2, representing the imaginary part of the complex numbers.

Outputs:

1. A sum of the two complex numbers, represented by the std::complex<int> class.
2. The imaginary part of the sum, represented by a boolean.

Summary:

The code defines a user-defined complex class that contains two integers, real and imaginary, to represent a complex number. The class provides a method called addComp() that adds two complex numbers represented by the class object. The method creates a temporary object and returns the sum of the two complex numbers. The driver code creates two complex numbers C1 and C2 and calculates their sum using the addComp() method. The output of the program is the sum of the two complex numbers.

SystemC equivalent:

The SystemC code below captures the same logic as the provided C++/C code above. It uses the same input and output signals as the C++ code. The class Complex is defined as an entity with two inputs (real and imaginary) and two outputs (real_sum and imag_sum). The entity has a method addC() that adds the two complex numbers real1 and real2. The driver code instantiates two Complex entities, using the real1 and imag1 as inputs, and calculates the sum using the add() method. The output of the entity is the sum of the complex numbers. The SystemC code uses signals to represent the inputs and outputs, allowing it to integrate with the testbench.

```
// Complex class definition
entity Complex {
  in real1, imag1;
  in real2, imag2;
  out real_sum, imag_sum;

  method addC();
};

// Driver code
Complex C1(real1, imag1);
Complex C2(real2, imag2);
Complex C3 = C1.addC(C2);
```
