  This is a task that requires a deep understanding of both the syntax and semantics of C++ and C code, as well as a good knowledge of the SystemC HDL model.

**Inputs and outputs**:

The provided C++/C code defines two inputs, `octal_input` and `decimal_output`, and outputs the calculated decimal equivalent of the input octal value through `decimal_output`. Therefore, `octal_input` is the only input signal, and `decimal_output` is the only output signal.

**Summary**:

* The code reads in an input octal number through `octal_input` and initializes a variable `num` with that value.
* It then creates a `dec_value` variable and initializes it to 0.
* The code then creates a `base` variable and assigns it the value 1, which will be used for raising 8 to power 0 in the below loop.
* The `temp` variable is then assigned the value of `num`, which is used in the below loop to extract the last digit in the octal number.
* The `last_digit` variable is then assigned the value of `temp` modulo 10, which is the last digit in the octal number.
* `base` is then assigned the value of `base` multiplied by 8, which will be used for raising 8 to power 1 in the next iteration of the loop.
* The `temp` variable is then assigned the value of `temp` divided by 10, which is used to shift the octal number by one digit to the right.
* The code continues this process until `temp` is 0, which signifies that there are no more digits in the octal number.
* Finally, the `dec_value` variable is returned as the output through `decimal_output`.

**SystemC equivalent**:
```scss
module octal_to_decimal(
    input octal_input,
    output decimal_output
);

  // C++ code to convert octal to decimal
  int octalToDecimal(int n)
  {
      int num = n;
      int dec_value = 0;

      // Initializing base value to 1, 
      // i.e 8^0
      int base = 1;

      int temp = num;
      while (temp) 
      {
          // Extracting last digit
          int last_digit = temp % 10;
          temp = temp / 10;

          // Multiplying last digit with 
          // appropriate base value and adding 
          // it to dec_value
          dec_value += last_digit * base;

          base = base * 8;
      }

      return dec_value;
  }

  // Driver code
  void adder()
  {
      int num = octal_input;
      decimal_output = octalToDecimal(num);
  }

endmodule
```
In the provided SystemC equivalent, `octal_to_decimal` is the module name, and `octal_input` and `decimal_output` are the input and output ports, respectively. The C++ code is converted into SystemC and integrated into the module. `adder` is the driver for the module, and reads the input through `octal_input` and outputs the calculated decimal equivalent of the input octal value through `decimal_output`.
