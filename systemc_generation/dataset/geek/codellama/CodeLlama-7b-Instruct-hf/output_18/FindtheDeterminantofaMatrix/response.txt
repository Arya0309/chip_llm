  This C++ program calculates the determinant of a matrix using the LU factorization method. In this implementation, several inputs are needed, including the matrix to be solved and its size (n).

The inputs to the function are:

* matrix: input matrix
* n: designates the size of the matrix

The resulting output is:

* det: the determinant of the matrix

The program reads in the input matrix (matrix) and allocates an 2D array of the same size (n) at runtime using the C++ compilation directive const int MAXN = 105;. As a result, the program cannot be executed without defining the constant value 105. The n value is used to determine the array size that corresponds with the matrix size.

The class method is defined here. It performs the determinant calculation and returns the answer in the variable determinant.

The program's main procedure reads the value of n, allocates the matrix [n][n]to it, and then initializes the matrix to equal the input matrix element-for-element. For every row the program makes a pivot, by selecting the maximum row of the pivot column except for the line. Then, it checks whether the pivot row is the current line of the program. If not, it swaps the current row and line with the pivot rows by placing the location of the two rows into a temp varriable and the assigning the variable to the current row and keyboard. The swapped data is placed back into the various variables after swapping the two rows. After the current row is not the same as the previous one, the program computes the gauss-jordan elimination of the current row which involves the last row and removes the elements of this column from previous rows and adds the arrays to the results, and then replacing the element of the first variable with the results.

Finally, the program returns the determinant value.

Here's an SystemC code that performs the same function, it writes an equivalent algorithm to the C++/C code.

```
#include <systemc.h>

#define MAXN 105 
 
SC_MODULE(Determinant) {
        sc_in <double>matrix[n];
        sc_out<double> det;
      
        // Constructor
        SC_CTOR(Determinant)
      
        void compute() {
            double a [MAXN][MAXN], det;
            int n;
            //Interator variable
            int i, j, k;
   
            // read input matrix
            for(i =0; i < n; i++) {
                for(j =0; j < n; j++) {
                    a[i][j] = matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
   
            // Determinant calculation
            det = 0.0;
            for(i =0; i < n; i++) {
                int pivot = i;
                for(j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                    if(abs(a[j][i]) > abs(a[pivot][i])) {
                        pivot = j;
                    }
                }
                if(pivot != i) {
                    swap(a[i], a[pivot]);
                    det *= -1;
                }
                if(a[i][i] == 0) {
                    return 0;
                }
                det *= a[i][i];
                for(j= i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                    double factor = a[j][i] / a[i][i];
                    for(k = i + 1; k < n; k++) {
                        a[j][k] -= factor * a[i][k];
                    }
                }
            }
            deteminant = det;
        }
};
