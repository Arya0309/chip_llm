  Here is a natural language summary of the provided C++/C code, as well as a proposed SystemC code that corresponds to its logic:

**Inputs:**

* `original_arr`, a pointer to an array of integers.
* `len`, the length of the `original_arr` array.

**Outputs:**

* The copied array, stored in `copied_arr`.

**Functionality:**

The code is a C++/C program that copies the contents of an array into another array in reverse order. The input array is defined as `original_arr`, and its length is stored in `len`. The output array is also defined as `copied_arr`.

The code first declares two arrays, `original_arr` and `copied_arr`, and initializes them with the same length. It then loops through each element of the `original_arr` array and copies the element in the reversed order to the corresponding position in the `copied_arr` array.

After copying the elements of the array, the code prints the original and copied arrays using the `printArray` function.

**SystemC Code:**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(COPY_REVERSE) {
  sc_in<int> original_arr; // Input port for original array
  sc_in<int> len; // Input port for array length
  sc_out<int> copied_arr; // Output port for copied array
  sc_sync_process add();

  void add() {
    int i, j;
    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      copied_arr[i] = original_arr[len - i - 1];
    }
  }
};
```
This SystemC code includes the following components:

* `original_arr`: The input port for the array that contains the elements to copy.
* `len`: The input port for the array length.
* `copied_arr`: The output port for the array that stores the copied elements.
* `add`: The synchronous process that copies the elements of the input array into the output array in reverse order.

**Interconnection:**

The `add` process is synchronous, meaning that it is executed in response to a specific event or clock signal. It takes two input ports: `original_arr` and `len`. The `original_arr` port is used to access the input array, and the `len` port is used to obtain the length of the array.

The `add` process loops through each element of the `original_arr` array and copies the element in the reversed order to the corresponding position in the `copied_arr` array. The `len` variable is used to determine the number of elements to copy.

The `add` process does not have any output ports, as its purpose is to copy the input array into the output array. However, the output array is accessible through the `copied_arr` port.
