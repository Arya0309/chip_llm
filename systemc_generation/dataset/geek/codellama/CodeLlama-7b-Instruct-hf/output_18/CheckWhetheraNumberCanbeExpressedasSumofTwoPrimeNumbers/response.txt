  This Simple C++ program defines two functions. A function takes two inputs and checks if they are prime numbers. If a third number can be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers, it checks if the number is prime, and the number minus two is also prime. That function is called in the main function. It outputs a value of true or false when it determines the answer.

The inputs to the code are an integer n, and a function isPrime that takes an integer n and determines if it's a prime number. The outputs of the code are either true or false depending on the function isPrime.

A similar high-level behavior can be achieved by writing the following SystemC code:


```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module to take two inputs and check if they are prime
SC_MODULE(isPrime){
  sc_in<int> n; // Input for the module that accepts a number to check
  sc_in<int> prime_one; // Input for the module that accepts the first prime to add
  sc_out<bool> prime; // Output for the module that returns the answer of whether to add the two states has two prime factors
  sc_trace(sc_trace_file, n); // Traces the input
  sc_trace(sc_trace_file, prime); // Traces the output

  // Constructors
  SC_CTOR(isPrime): prime_one(1){
    // Method to determine if the input is a pryme
    SC_METHOD(determinePrime);
    sensitive << n;
  }

  // Method to determine if the input prime and the prime minus one are both prime
  void determinePrime() {
    if((n % prime_one.read()) == 0){
      // The input is prime and the separate prime is not 0
      prime.write(true);
      }
    else{
      // The input is not prime and the seperate prime is not 0
      prime.write(false);
      }
  }
};
```

This code includes the same logic as the provided C++/C source code. However, this SystemC code complies with the signals already programmed into the driver code for the testbench.
