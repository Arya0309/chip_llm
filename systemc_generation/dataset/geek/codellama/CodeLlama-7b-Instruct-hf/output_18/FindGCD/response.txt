  Inputs:  a, b (integers)
Output: gcd_result (integer)

This C++/C code finds GCD of two integers a and b using a simple arithmetic approach.

1 Include Declarations:
  The C++/C code begins with an include directive that loads the bits/stdc++ library. It then uses the namespace std to compose the code.
2 Function declaration:  
  The code then defines a function gcd with two integer parameters of type int that returns an integer using the return statement.
3 Internal functions:
  There is one internal function in the function gcd. It is a minimum function that is used to find the minimum value of two integers. This function returns an integer value.
4 Main function:   
  The remaining code in the program are in the main function. In the main, there are two variables, a and b. Initially, these variables are set to 12 and 16. 
5 Find gcd:
  The program then finds gcd, which is a subset of the two integers using gcd function. This gcd function reduces one integer to the gcd of the two numbers.
6 Returning gcd:
  The code then returns the result of the GCD function. This result is printed through cout.
7 main function ends:
  The main function then ends, finishing the execution of the program.

Inputs and Outputs:
The program takes two integer inputs, a, and b, and returns the gcd of those two numbers as output. It also uses the various functions throughout finding Minimum, finding GCD, testing divisibility, and printing the GCD of a and b.

SystemC Code:
 Here is a SystemC code example that generates equivalent behavior to the C++ code:

```
#include <stdio.h>
void sc_main () {
  int a, b, gcd_result;  // declaring inputs and outputs

  // read inputs a and b 
  a = sc_in.read<int>(); 
  b = sc_in.read<int>();

  // call gcd function 
  gcd_result = gcd (a, b);

  // write output gcd_result 
  sc_out.write<int>(gcd_result);  

}
```

This implementation uses the sc_in and sc_out ports for input and output connections, respectively. The gcd function is defined in the code above, and it will be discussed below.
Here is a simple SystemC code example that executes the gcd function:

```
int sc_gcd (int a, int b) {

  // declare and initialize the output value of the function
  int res = sc_out.write<int>(a, b);

  // declare and initialize a while loop to test divisibility;
  // res is the input variable for the while loop condition
  while (res > 1) {

    // if either the res function is divisible by a or the res function is divisible by b, we are done!
    if (a % res == 0 && b % res == 0)
      break;
    res--;
  }

  return res;  // return the gcd result
```
According to this code snippet, the function gcd uses a while loop to find GCD of the supplied integers a and b. The gcd_status function's action is to reduce one number to the gcd of the two supplied numbers. 
The sc_in and sc_out ports are connected internally variables, which are created to manage read and write operations. These variables are used to complete  input/output jobs.
