  C++/C Program to Multiply Two Matrices

The provided C++/C program is a simple multiply two matrices program. The program declares two matrices, mat1 and mat2, of different sizes, and then uses a nested loop to compute the product of the two matrices. The resulting product is then printed to the console.

Inputs:

* mat1: a 2x2 matrix of integers.
* mat2: a 2x3 matrix of integers.

Outputs:

* C: the product of mat1 and mat2, which is a 2x3 matrix of integers.

Explanation:

The program starts by defining two matrices, mat1 and mat2. mat1 is a 2x2 matrix, and mat2 is a 2x3 matrix. The program then uses a nested loop to compute the product of the two matrices.

The outer loop iterates over the rows of mat1, and the inner loop iterates over the columns of mat2. For each iteration, the inner loop computes the dot product of the row of mat1 with each column of mat2, and stores the result in the corresponding element of mat1.

Once the outer loop has completed, the program prints the resulting product mat1 and mat2 to the console.

SystemC Code:

void mulMat(const sc_l_array<int, SIZE_A> &A, const sc_l_array<int, SIZE_B> &B, sc_l_array<int, SIZE_RESULT> &C)
{
	int rslt[R1][C2];

	cout << "Multiplication of given two matrices is:\n";

	for (int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
			rslt[i][j] = 0;

			for (int k = 0; k < R2; k++) {
				rslt[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
			}

			cout << rslt[i][j] << "\t";
		}

		cout << endl;
	}
}

int sc_main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
	sc_clock clk("clk", 10, SC_NS, 0.5, 0, SC_NS);
	sc_signal<bool> rst("rst");

	int mat1[SIZE_A][SIZE_B] = { { 1, 1 }, { 2, 2 } };

	int mat2[SIZE_B][SIZE_C] = { { 1, 1, 1 }, { 2, 2, 2 } };

	if (SIZE_A != SIZE_B) {
		cout << "The number of columns in Matrix-1 must "
				<< "be equal to the number of rows in "
				<< "Matrix-2";
	}

	int result[SIZE_C][SIZE_RESULT];
	mulMat(mat1, mat2, result);

	for (int i = 0; i < SIZE_C; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < SIZE_RESULT; j++) {
			cout << result[i][j] << "\t";
		}

		cout << endl;
	}
}

This SystemC code uses the SystemC sc_l_array<int> data type to represent the matrices. The mulMat function implements the matrix multiplication logic, and the sc_main function provides a simple testbench to demonstrate the code's functionality.
