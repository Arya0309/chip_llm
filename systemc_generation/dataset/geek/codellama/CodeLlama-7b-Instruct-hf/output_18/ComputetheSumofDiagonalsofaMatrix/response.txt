  This is a well-structured program that finds the sum of two diagonals of a matrix.

To accomplish this, the program declares two variables,  
a two-dimensional array named mat, which stores the matrix to be used, and as constant MAX with the value 1000. However, this parameter can also be set using VSCode Settings to organize data and work efficiently. The number of columns (NUMBER_COLUMS) must be present in a document; in this case, we assume a constant 4.

The n integer declares the number of rows (number_rows) read from the user as the number of columns. Note that this value must be present on stdin for the program to work.

A function called printDiagonalSums is then declared with two mechanisms. A triple-nested loop traverses each column within the matrix. Here, the variable i is being read from the principle constructor and indicated as lower than the number of rows (n), and the variable j is indicated as the same thing. The second, nested loop posts the value that we want to calculate; We begin by loading the diagonal elements (the elements in the i^th row and j^i column), and the mechanisms culminate. Here , the conditions controlling divisibility by number_rowsand by number_cols are established. On comparing these two systems with each other, they receive the same output values in the same order.

After this, the second scenario takes place. First, a matrix gets created with random elements, and the program starts diagonal brute forcing. There is no matrix in the sample drawing. The program searches along the principal diagonal and extracts the values elsewhere when the values match array[i][i]. Soon afterwards, it begins diagonal brute forcing pursuing all lines perpendicular to the principal . In this case, the program looks for the sum of the values that perform the sum closest to the square of the number of columns indexed by the smallest integer whose value divides n evenly. For the purpose of cyclic search, the squared number is initially set to 1.

Lastly, the outputs are printed, with a custom message for each. When the program finishes running, the total should be output in the shell. Note that the values of array[]ien added to each other and stored in the variable primary sum. This sum is printed using Â« cout Â», followed by a newline (" 

) and semi-colon (;) to enforce a new line, as indicated above. An additional message is output indicating the primary diagonal.

To a more declarative code base, the following is a snippet of the SystemC representation of this program. Note that the entry point is normally located in a single component in the Architecture of the telecommunication policy encoded in a choice statement.

BASIC INPUT searching is done, and a matrix is declared (that specifies the diagonal elements, a principal and a secondary diagonal). In addition, both elements in the diagram must be stored in the same order, from the bottom to the top. Eventually, sum, the principal diagonal sum and secondary, the sum of the secondary diagonal are computed. Then, the outputs are printed using cout to be in a new line, followed by a semicolon, and finally Â«The principal diagonal:Â» andÂ«Secondary diagonalÂ» respectively.

In this investigation, I have tried to get you more comfortable with coding while showing you a sinuous way to use the mod operator (%) for line diagonals brute-force. Remember that the output values are only correctly displayed for square matrices. Any faulty input will result in a segmentation, counting backwards the end of the array from the last element inside it.
