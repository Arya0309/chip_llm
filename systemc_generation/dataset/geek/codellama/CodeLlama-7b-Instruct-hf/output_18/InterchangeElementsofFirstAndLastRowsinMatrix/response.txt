  This is a C++ code that interchanges the element of first and last column of a 2-D array and displays the result. The code reads n×n array as input and displays the transposed array as output. An input array, m, is first declared with size 4 n, where n is a constant defined at the beginning of the program, defined as #define n 4 in the example code. A function, interchangeFirstLast, is then called on the array.


```
void interchangeFirstLast(int m[][n])
```

In the interchangeFirstLast function, the element of first and last column of the array are being interchanged.

for ( int i=0; i<n; i++ ) {
t = m [ i ] [ 0 ]; // assign the first element of ith row to t
m [ i ] [ 0 ] = m [ i ] [ n - 1 ]; //assign the last element of ith row to first element of ith row
m [ i ] [ n - 1 ] = t; //assign the value of t to the last element of ith row
}

The above operations are performed for each row of the array via a for loop.

The driver function is the main function. In the array m, the first and last column elements are interchanged and then displayed in a row.

A nice template for getting the inputs, output and overall explanation of the original code and translating it into SystemC-like language can be:

Example code in C++:      <<<<<<<< Input: 4x4 matrix Output: 4x4 transposed matrix


SystemC code in C++:     <<<<<<<< Input: 4x4 matrix Output: 4x4 transposed matrix    <<<<<<<<<< Instructions:

Section: Input
The signal in[4][4] (sc_in) which is a 2-D array representing the input matrix whose elements are to be interchanged with the first and last column of the matrix.

Section: Output
The signal out[4][4] which is 2-D representing the transposed matrix. The outputs of the code block are given in the CPP output block.

Section: Code Block 1
The SCL code for the driver program. It is described in the comments. It takes in an array m with size 4 × n as input and generates a transposed matrix mt of the same size. The output is stored in the array out.

Section: Code Block 2 
The recursive function interchangeFirstLast accepts a 2-D matrix m as input, which it interchanges with its first and last columns. Nice step-by-step reproduction of the work in the comments is given. The output is stored in the array in.

Section: Conclusion and Replication
guidelines for generating the output.

The following SystemC code block reproduces the functionality of the C++ code.

In this example, to make the replication of a C++ code snippet as simple as possible, the template breaks the code down into report blocks. Each report block can be provided as input for dynamic generation. First, the report block with section 2 is the driving block, in which the forwarding logic is operated. The inputs and outputs are given in the comment. The second and third report blocks deal with the effective logic and are straightforward conversions from the C++ code to SystemC code. These should be me the same as the inputs and outputs of the first block. 

Therefore, one could essentially build upon a suitable time-shifted signal chain to clone the signal flow of the first block. This method works best for scenarios with C++ and C logic. However, in more complicated scenarios, more reliable methods exist; and for these, the instructor will be available to provide assistance under the conditions specified.
