  This is a translate C++ to SystemC one. This program uses the function `octalToDecimal()` to take an input of an octal number and an output in decimal. The input can be either from the console or another source such as a database.

The first lane of codes declares the necessary headers as well as declaring two functions `octalToDecimal()`, and `main()`. The function shows how to convert an octal number to a decimal number.

Our input digital one `octal_input` and can get decimal output using `decimal_output`; these are the inputs and outputs of the program. The function calls a loop where the decimal value is incremented in each iteration until the input is zero.

Next is the main function where the input port will print the output which is equal to the sum of powers.

After this, the code imports and creates the namespace sc_main with an sc_inport and sc_output port from the systemC.h library.

The function is organized into two parts: initialization and testing. The initialization section declares variables and ports and the process grown to add the two numbers, which is stored in the sum attribute. 
The corresponding sc_read and sc_write codes perform the I/O operations.  

Therefore,  the SystemC code is below:

```C
#include <systemc.h>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to convert octal to decimal
int octalToDecimal(int n)
{
	int digit = n;  // Input port for the first number
	int dec_value = 0;
	int base = 1; 

	int temp = digit;
	while (temp){
		// Extracting last digit
		int last_digit = temp % 10;
		temp = temp / 10;

		// Multiplying last digit with 
		// appropriate base value and adding 
		// it to dec_value
		dec_value += last_digit * base;
		base = base * 8;
	}

	return dec_value;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	sc_in<int> octal_input; 
	sc_out<int> decimal_output;

	int num = 67;

	decimal_output = octalToDecimal(num);

	cout << octal_input;
}
```
