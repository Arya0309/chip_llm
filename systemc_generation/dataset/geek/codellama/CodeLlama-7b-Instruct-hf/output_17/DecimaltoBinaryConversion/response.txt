  **Inputs and Outputs**

The given C++/C code defines a function called "decToBinary" which takes an integer "n" as input, and outputs the binary representation of "n" in a sequence of blocks. The function also has a "cout" statement to print the binary representation of "n" to the console.

The "main" function defines a single input, "n", and invokes the "decToBinary" function to convert "n" to binary. The function also defines a "return 0" statement, which signals the end of the program.

The provided SystemC code utilizes two signals: "sc_in<int> dec_in" and "sc_out<int> binary_out". These signals are used to pass the input "n" to the "decToBinary" function and receive the converted binary output, "binary_out".

**Natural Language Summary of C++/C Code**

The given C++/C code defines a function called "decToBinary" which takes an integer "n" as input and converts it to binary. The function uses a while loop to iterate through the binary representation of "n" and stores the binary digits in an array. The array is then printed to the console in reverse order.

The "main" function defines a single input, "n", and invokes the "decToBinary" function to convert "n" to binary. The function also defines a "return 0" statement, which signals the end of the program.

**SystemC Code Snippet**
```scss
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that converts a decimal number to binary
SC_MODULE(DecToBinary) {
    sc_in<int> dec_in;  // Input port for the decimal number
    sc_out<int> binary_out; // Output port for the binary representation

    // Declare the array to store the binary digits
    int binaryNum[32];

    // Counter for the binary array
    int i = 0;

    // Process to convert the decimal to binary
    void convert() {
        // While the input number is greater than 0
        while (dec_in.read() > 0) {
            // Store the remainder in the binary array
            binaryNum[i] = dec_in.read() % 2;
            dec_in.read(dec_in.read() / 2);
            i++;
        }
    }

    // Method to print the binary representation
    void print() {
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            binary_out.write(binaryNum[j]);
        }
    }

    // Constructor
    DecToBinary(sc_module_name name) : sc_module(name) {
        // Process to perform the conversion
        SC_METHOD(convert);
        sensitive << dec_in;

        // Method to print the binary representation
        SC_METHOD(print);
        sensitive << binary_out;
    }
};
```
The generated SystemC code defines a new SystemC module called "DecToBinary" which has three processes: "convert", "print", and the constructor.

The "convert" process receives the input "dec_in" and uses a while loop to iterate through the binary representation of "dec_in" and stores the binary digits in an array.

The "print" process receives the output "binary_out" and iterates through the binary digits in reverse order, printing each binary digit using the "binary_out.write()" statement.

The constructor is used to link the "dec_in" and "binary_out" signals to the "convert" and "print" processes, respectively. The constructor also connects the "convert" and "print" processes to the SystemC "main" function.
