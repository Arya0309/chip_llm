  Based on the provided C++/C code, the following is a natural language summary, with line-by-line and block-by-block explanations:

1. The inputs of the code are a square 2D array `mat` of size `n x n` and an integer variable `n`.
2. The output of the code are two integer variables `principal` and `secondary`, whose values are determined from the input array and calculated using two loop iterations.
3. The C++/C code declares two for loops: the first one iterates over the rows of the matrix `mat`, while the second one iterates over the columns of the matrix. Each iteration of the second loop checks two diagonal conditions: the primary diagonal and the secondary diagonal.
4. For each row `i` of the matrix, the primary diagonal elements `mat[i][i]` are added to `principal`. Conversely, for each column `j` of the matrix, the secondary diagonal elements `mat[j][n-1-j]` are added to `secondary`.
5. After both loops have executed, the values of `principal` and `secondary` are printed to the console.
6. The driver program `main` creates an array `a` of size `4 x 4`, initializes it to a simple diagonal matrix, and calls the function `printDiagonalSums` with the array and its size as input.

Here is an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic of the original C++/C source and integrates with the predefined signals:

```
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(DiagonalSums) {
    sc_in<int> matrix[SIZE];  // Input matrix
    sc_out<int> principal;
    sc_out<int> secondary;

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(DiagonalSums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                // Condition for principal diagonal
                if (i == j) {
                    int value = matrix[i][j];
                    // Use signal principal to output the value
                    principal.write(value);
                }

                // Condition for secondary diagonal
                if ((i + j) == (SIZE - 1)) {
                    int value = matrix[i][j];
                    // Use signal secondary to output the value
                    secondary.write(value);
                }
            }
        }
        // Use signals principal and secondary to capture the output values of the code
    }
};
```
In line 17, we replace the input array `mat` with the SystemC signal `matrix`, which has been previously declared as an input signal. In line 19, we use the two signals `principal` and `secondary` to capture the output values of the code. 

The generated SystemC code is in a comprehensible and modularized manner, capturing the same logic as the C++/C code.
