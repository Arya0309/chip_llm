  Sure! Here's a natural language summary of the provided C++/C code, followed by its equivalent SystemC code that preserves the logic.

Inputs:

* An integer matrix `m` of size `n x n`

Outputs:

* An integer matrix `m` with the first and last columns interchanged

Functionality:

* The `interchangeFirstLast` function takes in an `n x n` integer matrix `m` as input and interchanges the elements in the first and last columns.
* The function first loops through all the rows of the matrix using a `for` loop with index `i` and interchanges the elements at `m[i][0]` and `m[i][n-1]`.
* The function then returns `void` once it has completed the interchange.
* The `main` function takes in an `n x n` integer matrix `m` as input and calls the `interchangeFirstLast` function to interchange the first and last columns.

SystemC Code:
```
// SystemC code to swap the element of first and 
// last column and display the result

#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE(InterchangeFirstLast) {
    sc_in<int> in [4] [4];  // Input port for the matrix
    sc_out<int> out [4] [4]; // Output port for the interchanged matrix

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(InterchangeFirstLast) {
        // Process to interchange the first and last columns
        SC_METHOD(interchangeColumn);
        sensitive << in [0] [0] << in [0] [1] << in [0] [2] << in [0] [3];
        sensitive << in [1] [0] << in [1] [1] << in [1] [2] << in [1] [3];
        sensitive << in [2] [0] << in [2] [1] << in [2] [2] << in [2] [3];
        sensitive << in [3] [0] << in [3] [1] << in [3] [2] << in [3] [3];
    }

    // Method to interchange the first and last columns
    void interchangeColumn() {
        for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int t = m[i][0];
            m[i][0] = m[i][3];
            m[i][3] = t;
        }
    }

    // Main process
    void main() {
        interchangeColumn(); // Interchange the first and last columns

        // Print the interchanged matrix
        for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
                cout << out[i][j] << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
};
```
