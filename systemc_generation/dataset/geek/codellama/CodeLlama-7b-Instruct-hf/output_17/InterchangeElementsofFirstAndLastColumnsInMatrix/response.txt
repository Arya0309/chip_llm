  This C++/C code snippet is an algorithm for swapping the first and last rows of a matrix, and then displaying the interchanged matrix. The code analyzes the input matrix, transfers the elements of the first and last rows of the matrix, and then prints the resulting interchanged matrix. The values are initialized and stored in an array. The program uses a for loop with a condition of reading and writing back the elements of each row, and then printing the values.

Inputs: The input is an n x n array of n rows and columns of integer values. The code assigns the values of the array to n rows and columns of an input array and then displays results.
Output: The program displays an interchanged 4-by-4 matrix of interchange.

The primary purpose of this SystemC code is to swap the first and last rows of a matrix and print the new matrix that reflects this modification. Given the input array n[SIZE], the code creates an output array num[SIZE] and assigns m[n - 1][i] to the variable t if i is less than n. This code loops over the rows of the matrix and implements the swapping, which is actually a simple transposition. It then calls the function interchangeFirstLast to assign the interchanged values array to the variable m, print result, and display it.

In sum, this code causes a matrix to be transformed into a new matrix in which the duplicates are shuffled. It takes ideal and ideal input and gives the ideal output.
