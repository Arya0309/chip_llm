  Task 1: Read and Analyze the C++/C Code

The provided C++/C code includes a function named `findTrace` and `findNormal`. These functions find the trace and normal of a given matrix, respectively. The code declares a constant `MAX` to specify the size of the matrix, and uses nested loops to compute the trace and normal of the matrix. The functions take two inputs: a matrix and its size `n`, and return two outputs: the trace and normal of the matrix.

The code also includes a main function that reads in a matrix of size `100 x 100` and outputs the trace and normal of the matrix using the above functions.

Task 2: Identify Inputs and Outputs

The inputs of the code are:

* The matrix to be processed (array of array)
* The size of the matrix (integer)

The outputs of the code are:

* The trace of the matrix
* The normal of the matrix

Task 3: Detailed Explanation and SystemC Code Generation

1. The function `findTrace` takes in a matrix `mat` of size `n x n` and returns the trace of the matrix, which is the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. The function uses nested loops to iterate through the matrix and calculate the trace.

SystemC code snippet:
```scss
void findTrace(int mat[][MAX], int n) {
    int trace_sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i == j) {
                trace_sum += mat[i][j];
            }
        }
    }
    return trace_sum;
}
```

1. The function `findNormal` takes in a matrix `mat` of size `n x n` and returns the normal of the matrix, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the elements of the matrix. The function uses nested loops to iterate through the matrix and calculate the normal.

SystemC code snippet:
```scss
void findNormal(int mat[][MAX], int n) {
    int normal_sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            normal_sum += mat[i][j] * mat[i][j];
        }
    }
    return sqrt(normal_sum);
}
```

1. The main function is used to read in a matrix `mat` of size `100 x 100` and output the trace and normal of the matrix using the `findTrace` and `findNormal` functions.

SystemC code snippet:
```scss
void main() {
    int mat[MAX][MAX];
    int n = 100;
    int trace, normal;
    
    // Read in the matrix
    // ...
    
    // Compute the trace and normal
    trace = findTrace(mat, n);
    normal = findNormal(mat, n);
    
    // Output the trace and normal
    cout << "Trace: " << trace << endl;
    cout << "Normal: " << normal << endl;
    
    // Clean up
    // ...
}
```
Note that the generated SystemC code utilizes the signals `matrix`, `trace`, and `norm`, which are used for testbench integration.
