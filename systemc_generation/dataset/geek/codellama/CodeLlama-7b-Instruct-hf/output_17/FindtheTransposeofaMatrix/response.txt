  The provided C++/C code is a program that computes the transpose of a matrix. Here's a natural language summary of the code:

1. C++/C code includes headers and defines a function, transpose, that takes two arrays as input and returns another array as output.
2. transpose function works on a 2D array, A, to fetch each of the elements as a 'subarray' without a tipping boundary. The value the function returns (B) is another array with all the elements that are in the same position in an object as if they were swapped.
3. The transpose() function repeatedly swaps elements from one row to another, from left to right until the last row on the right.

To generate SystemC code with the same logic, consider the following snippet:

#include <systemc.h>

// Module to calculate Transpose
SC_MODULE(transpose) {

    sc_in<int> a[SIZE][SIZE];      // Input array
    sc_out<int> b[SIZE][SIZE];     // Output array

    void transpose();

    // Constructor to create transpose()
    SC_CTOR(transpose) {
        // Task to calculate transpose
        SC_METHOD(transpose);
        sensitive << a[0][0];
        sensitive << a[0][1];
        // and up to a[N-1][N-1], which would run until the last element of input 2D array (A);
    }

    // Transpose task to calculate transpose matrix
    void transpose() {
        // temporary variable to store each subarray
        int B[SIZE][SIZE];

        int i, j;
        for (i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
            for (j = 0; j < SIZE; j++)
                B[i][j] = a[j][i];
    }
};
