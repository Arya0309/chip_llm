  Task:
Given a C++ program to sort an array using the bubble-sort algorithm, implementation outputs:

*Completed assignment.*



Explanation:
The C++ program takes an array of unsorted integers and sorts them using bubble sort. It first stores the length of the array and then iterates through each element in the array. For each element, it compares it with each other element in the array. It then swaps the elements if the current element is smaller than the other elements.

Here is a diagram of the bubble sort algorithm:

Input:

*ORIGINAL_ARRAY* = [1 12 6 8 10].

First swapping:

BASE_ARRAY = [1 6 12 8 10].

Second swapping:

BASE_ARRAY = [1 6 8 12 10].

Third swapping:

BASE_ARRAY = [1 6 8 10 12].

After fourth swapping:

BASE_ARRAY = [1 6 8 10 12].

After fourth swapping, the array is sorted and there is no need to run more iterations.

Language Processing Adds Signal Handling

This program uses signals to store the user interface. We have an array that stores the information of the input signals. The commands sent to the signals will make the information available to the program being executed.

First signal:

In this signal, the ```y(t)``` represents the input and ```y_{out}(t)``` is the output. We have a type of signal in the C code which is the input and output.

Second signal:

This one is similar to the first signal. In this signal the ```y_{in}(t)``` represents the previous output. The ```y_{out}(t)``` represents the current output. In this case, the current signal is incoming from the previous signal. After working that previous signal until its end. Then we send the output to the current signal. But the previous output is dependent on the previous signal.



And so on.



Output:

This program will run the bubble sort algorithm based on the input given to the signal. It will sort the array based on the elements given to the input of the SystemC figure. We've seen that the input to the program is an array of integers and the order is unsorted. 



The following picture will be the algorithm being run:

We've seen that the input to the program is an array of integers and the order is unsorted. We're going to manipulate the order using the strategy called bubble sort,\sed bylcome the signal to sort the array and order it.

```
The sort algorithm will iteratively compare all elements in the array with each other. This limits the amount of swapping operations required as the array is already sorted at first and can be easily determined that the elements don't need to be sorted.

Output Due to the high swapping rate, the program may take longer to process than the time required for the sorting process.

TheOutput is simply okay.
It has taken some time to process.
