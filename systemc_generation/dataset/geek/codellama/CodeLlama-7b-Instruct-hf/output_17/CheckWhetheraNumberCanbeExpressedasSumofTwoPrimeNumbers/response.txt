  C++/C Code: A Prime Sum Judge

I. Introduction

The following C++/C code is a prime sum judge that can determine whether a given number is the sum of two prime numbers. This function will be implemented in a SystemC code snippet. The inputs and outputs have been identified and their natural language summaries will be described.

II. Implementation

a. Input and Outputs:

* Inputs: N - a signed integer that represents the number to be checked.

* Output: a boolean value that is true if the input number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, otherwise false.

ii. Algorithm Design

The algorithm first determines whether the input number is prime. If it is, it checks whether the number - 2 is also prime. If both are prime, then the input number is the sum of two prime numbers and the output is true.

a. Determining if a Number is Prime

To determine whether a number is prime, the following method is used:

The function checks whether the number is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it returns false; otherwise, it checks whether the number is divisible by 2. If it is not, it checks whether the number is divisible by 3. If it is not, it divides the number by 5 until it finds a prime factor. Otherwise, the number is prime and the function returns true.

ii. Implementing the Algorithm

A D event is used to determine whether the input number is prime. The D event checks whether the input number is less than or equal to 1 and returns false if it does; otherwise, it checks whether the input number is divisible by 2 and returns true if it is not. If the input number is divisible by 2, a C event is used to determine whether it is divisible by 3. If it is not, a B event is used to determine whether it is divisible by 5. Otherwise, another B event is used to determine whether the number is the sum of two prime numbers. If so, the output is true, otherwise false.

iii. SystemC Code

The SystemC code below faithfully reflects the functionality of the C++/C source. Unlike the C++/C code, this SystemC code uses the boolean keywords to produce outputs and input/output ports to transfer data. The code also includes system signatures that will integrate with the testbench:

```c++
#include <systemc.h>
#define boolean std_logic_1

// Module that evaluates a prime sum
SC_MODULE(prime_sum) {
    // Input and output ports
    sc_in<int> input; // Signal for input number
    sc_out<boolean> output; // Signal for output flag

    // Method that checks if the input number is prime
    SC_METHOD(isPrime);
    sensitive << input;

    // Method that checks if the input number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers
    SC_METHOD(isPossible);
    sensitivity << output;

    // Evaluate whether the input number is a prime number
    void isPrime() {
        if (input.read() <= 1)  // If the number is less than or equal to 1 or null, it's not prime
            output.write(false);
        else {
            int i = input.read() / 2;  // if it's divisible by 2, it's not prime
            if (i != input.read() / i)
                output.write(true);
            else
                output.write(false);
        }
    }

    // Evaluate whether the input number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers
    void isPossible() {
        if (isPrime(input.read() - 2))  // Check if (input - 2) is prime
            output.write(true);  // If it is, then it's the sum of two prime numbers
        else
            output.write(false);  // If it's not, then it's not the sum of two prime numbers
    }
};

int main(void) {
    // Create the top-level module
    prime_sum *top = new prime_sum("top");

    // Assign input and output signals to SystemC modules
    top->input.connect(n_in);
    top->output.connect(result_out);

    // Run the simulation
    sc_clock Cclk(sc_time(10, SC_NS), SC_NS, 0.5);
    sc_start(100, SC_NS);

    return 0;
}
```

The code comments are explained here.

First, a defined module in SystemC language, prime_sum, is created, n_in = input(), and result_out = output(). Add the following SystemC modules to the top-level module:

* A boolean prime_sum module that has a boolean isPrime() function defined.

iii. Regenerate the SystemC Language Code

SystemC is a programming language that allows programmers to define and analyze electronic systems in a hardware/software/systems sense. SystemC code translates to the C++ language.

As a result, the top-level SystemC module, prime_sum, is transformed into equivalent C++ code as follows:
```bash
#include <systemc.h>

// Definition of top-level SystemC module
SC_MODULE(prime_sum)
{}

// Definition of boolean prime_sum module
SC_MODULE(prime_sum)
{}

// Definition of boolean module
SC_MODULE(bool)
{}

SC_MODULE(bool) // Synthesis lemma
{}

// Definition of methods
SC_METHOD(isPrime);
sensitive << input;

void isPrime() { // Determines if a number is prime.
    if (input.read() <= 1) // If the number is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime
        output.write(false);
    else {
        int i = input.read(); input.read() / 2; // Multiply the number with 2. Itâ€™s not a prime if the remainder is non-zero.
        if (i != input.read() / i)
            output.write(true); // Returns true if the number is a prime
        else
            output.write(false); // Returns false if the number is not a prime
    }
}

SC_METHOD(isPossible);
sensitivity << output;

void isPossible() { // Determine whether the input can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
    if (isPrime(input.read() - 2))  // Check if the number is a prime number
        output.write(true);  // Return true if it is
    else
        output.write(false);  // Otherwise, return false
}

int main = () // Main function
{
    return 0;
}
```

Based on the C++ code above, the C++/SystemC code can be integrated into any high-level synthesis flow if built, validated, and tested. Our C++ code includes a function that determines the input number's primality, which acts as a precondition for the problem of determining if the input number can be the sum of two prime numbers. Additionally, we have written a function that determines the input number's primality.

We can use this code in a high-level synthesis flow to perform the following functionality. Any number that can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers can be evaluated to determine its primality. The function can be used in a high-level synthesis tool to determine if the input number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
