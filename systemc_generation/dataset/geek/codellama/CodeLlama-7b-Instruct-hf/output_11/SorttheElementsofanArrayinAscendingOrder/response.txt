  Summary

The given C++/C code is a implementation of the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The code takes an array of integers and an integer indicating the array's length as input, and outputs the sorted array.

Inputs:

* The array of integers to be sorted
* The number of elements in the array

Outputs:

* The sorted array

Code explanation:

The code begins with the declaration of a few functions and variables, including sort() and swapNums(). These functions implement the bubble sort algorithm. The main() function is the entry point of the program, and it initializes an array of integers and calls the sort() function.

sort() is the main function that implements the bubble sort algorithm. It takes the array of integers and its length as input, and iterates over the elements of the array from back to front, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if the second element is smaller than the first element. It then checks if the elements were swapped during the iteration, and breaks out of the loop if they weren't. The loop continues until all the elements of the array have been compared and possibly swapped.

swapNums() is a helper function that swaps two elements in the array. It takes the array, two indices indicating the elements to be swapped, and swaps the elements at those indices.

Overall, the code uses a simple bubble sort algorithm to sort the input array of integers in ascending order.

SystemC code

Here is an example of how the same logic in the given C++/C code can be implemented in SystemC:

```scss
// Module for bubble sort
module bubblesort(input clk, input start, output done);
    logic [31:0] nums[5]; // Array of integers
    int len = 5; // Number of elements in the array

    // Initialize the array
    initial begin
        nums = '{1, 12, 6, 8, 10};
    end

    // sort function
    always_comb begin
        done = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) begin
            for (int j = 1; j < len - i; j++) begin
                if (nums[j] < nums[j - 1]) begin
                    swap(nums[j], nums[j - 1]);
                    done = 1;
                end
            end
        end
    end

    // Swap function
    function swap(ref int x, ref int y);
        int tmp;
        tmp = x;
        x = y;
        y = tmp;
    endfunction

    // Edge detection
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (start) begin
            done = 0;
            sort(nums, len);
        end
    end
endmodule
```

This SystemC code defines a bubblesort module that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The module takes three inputs: clk, start, and done, and one output: done. The input start is high when the sort function should be executed. The output done is high when the sort function has finished executing. The module uses a loop to iterate over the elements of the array, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if necessary. The swap function is used to swap the elements of the array. The edge detection block is used to detect rising edges on the clk signal, and call the sort function when start is high.

Note that this SystemC code assumes that the array is constant and cannot be modified. If you want to modify the array or make it dynamic, you will have to change the code accordingly.

This code preserves the logic of the original C++/C code and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow with the signals defined above.
