  C++/C program to find simple interest 
for given principal amount, time  and rate of interest.

INPUTS - P, R, T
OUTPUTS - SI

The inputs and outputs of the code have been defined in the C++ and System C code segments. The input values can be changed to get different output result. Using Standard C library, the C++/C program calculates simple interest using pricipal amount (Input P), time (Input T) and rate of interest (input R). The output resultant calculated SI is then printed. In addition, the System C code is generated to mirror the same logic as the C++/C code and may be used in a high-level synthesis flow. 

Here is a line-by-line and block-by-block natural language explanation:

1. Include the Standard C library header “iostream” and the using namespace std; statement is created. Hence, this code makes use of the outstream and instream functions standard operators such as >> (input) and << (output).
2. The driver code defines the P, R, and T values.  These inputs are type floats and may be different for different program run-times.
3. The variable SI is calculated as a float value based on the standard formula for simple interest (P x T x R)/100. The symbol ( ) indicates that SI is calculated and written as output. (cout <<).

1. The last line of the program calculates pricipal amount (P) x time (T) x rate of interest (R) as SI. 

The System C code provided is for a simple explanation and demonstration of the equivalent System C code. This code demonstrates the use of ports, modules, and sensitive and process blocks. 

Here’s a brief explanation:
 * sc_in P; sc_in R; sc_in T; sc_out SI; - Include header file, namespace declaration, input and output signals, and output signal to store final result.
    SC_MODULE(Adder) - Define a template for an adder module
    sc_in<int> a;  - Create input ports for the addends a
    sc_in<int> b; - Create input ports for the summand b
    sc_out<int> sum; - Define output ports for the sum
    SC_CTOR(Adder)  - Create the constructor for the adder module
    SC_METHOD(add) - Define a process that calculates the sum
    sensitive << a << b;
 
    The System C code is compilable and may seamlessly integrate with existing testbenches.
