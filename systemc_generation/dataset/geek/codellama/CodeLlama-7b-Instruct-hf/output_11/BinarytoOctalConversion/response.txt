  Task: Convert a C++/C program to its equivalent SystemC version

The C++/C program takes an octal number as input and returns the corresponding decimal number. The program uses a recursive function to perform the conversion. Additionally, the program demonstrates the concept of inheritance in C++.

Summary:

1. Inputs: The program takes an octal number as input, which can be represented as an integer value ranging between 0 and 7.

2. Outputs: The program returns the corresponding decimal number as an integer value.

3. Logic: The program uses a recursive function to perform the conversion, starting with a base case of 0 and a recursive case where the base case is multiplied by 8 and then added to the last digit of the octal number. The function then calls itself with the remaining digits of the octal number, until only the last digit is left. The final value is returned as the decimal equivalent of the octal number.

4. SystemC equivalent: The SystemC code requires two input ports (one for the octal number and another for the recursive call), a counter to keep track of the remaining digits in the octal number, an output port to represent the decimal equivalent, and a process to perform the recursion. The recursion logic is captured using the SystemC when method. The process is sensitive to the inputs and performs the multiplication and addition operations as defined in the C++ function.  

Example SystemC code:

// Module that converts octal to decimal
module octal_to_decimal {
// Ports:
    sc_in<int> octal_input;
    sc_out<int> decimal_output;

// Function to convert octal
// to decimal
int octalToDecimal(int n)
{
int num = n;
int dec_value = 0;

// Initializing base value to 1, 
// i.e 8^0
int base = 1;

int temp = num;
while (temp) 
{
    // Extracting last digit
    int last_digit = temp % 10;
    temp = temp / 10;

    // Multiplying last digit with 
    // appropriate base value and adding 
    // it to dec_value
    dec_value += last_digit * base;

    base = base * 8;
}
return dec_value;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    int num = octal_input.read(), dec_value = 0;

    // Call the recursive function to 
    // get the decimal equivalent
    dec_value = octalToDecimal(num);
    decimal_output.write(dec_value);
}
}
