  The provided C++/C source code checks if two given matrices are identical. The output is a binary signal that indicates whether the matrices match. The code takes in two NxN integer arrays representing the matrices and effectively returns a compiled condition. The areSame function should be rewritten into SystemC code that mimics the same behavior.

Here is a step-by-step natural language summary of the C++/C code:

1. The module starts with two integer arrays called A and B, each of size NxN, declared in the C++ code.
2. The main function is called from the C++ environment and takes in two array inputs of equal size.
3. The program shall check if two arrays are equal. The for loop in the block performs element-wise comparisons. If all the elements in the matrix are equal, then the entire matrices are identical, and the function returns a "1" to represent this fact. A scenario where all elements in the matrix are distinct, the function returns a "0" meaning the matrices are not identical.
4. The main function tests if the value of function `areSame()` is "1". If the function's return value is "1." It means that A and B are identical; the program writes the cout string for this condition. Otherwise, if the function's return value is "0," the program states that "Matrices are different." Then, the program exists with a return value of "0."

a. Identical matrices are criteria for emitting the text "Matrices are identical." Otherwise, emits "Matrices are not identical."
b. "n" areSame function parameters:
	* "int a[n][n]" and "int b[n][n]" are matrices to be compared for identity.
	* "N" is a global parameter defined with a value of 4. It determines the size of the matrices to be compared.
c. Within the "areSame" function block, the program iterates over the rows and columns (i) and (j) of both matrices to ensure they are alike. The "returns 0" value is assigned to the function if it finds any inequality between the matrices. When the program reaches the end, it exits if all the elements are identical and returns 1 if the matrices are different.

Below is a SystemC version of the program:

#include <systemc>

// Get labeled input
sc_in<int> A[SIZE];
sc_in<int> B[SIZE];
sc_out<bool> identical;

// Prototype for custom function
int areSame(int A[SIZE][SIZE], int B[SIZE][SIZE]);

void main() {
	int A[SIZE][SIZE] = {{1, 1, 1, 1},
												{2, 2, 2, 2},
												{3, 3, 3, 3},
												{4, 4, 4, 4}};
	int B[SIZE][SIZE] = {{1, 1, 1, 1},
												{2, 2, 2, 2},
												{3, 3, 3, 3},
												{4, 4, 4, 4}};

	if(areSame(A, B)) {
		cout << "Matrices are identical";
	}
	else {
		cout << "Matrices are not identical";
	}

	return 0;
} 

// This function performs source code transformation, checks if the two arrays of the same N size are identical. If all the elements match inside the matrix, the function returns 1, output "1" log. 
// Otherwise, the function returns 0, output "0" log.
int areSame(int A[SIZE][SIZE], int B[SIZE][SIZE]) {

	// Check for unequal elements
	for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; ++i) {
		for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; ++j) {
			if (A[i][j] != B[i][j]) {
				return 0;
			}
		}
	}

	return 1;
}

Note: In the generated SystemC code above, the respective sc_in ports for A and B signal arrays also come directly from the sc_in<int> ports, which can be reused directly from our existing testbench signals and consequently used for inter-module connections and logic operators. Also, make sure that the output identical signal is generated in the SystemC function's output, and not blocking instead.
