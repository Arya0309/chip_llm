  This is C++ code that calculates the compound interest for a user-defined principal, rate, and time. The output is the calculated interest. Here's the input, output, and function of the code.

Inputs:
* principal: The principal amount, a floating-point number type, is an input variable of type sc_in <double> type.
* rate: The rate of interest, a floating-point number type, is an input variable of type sc_in <double> type.
* time: The time in years, a floating-point number type, is an input variable of type sc_in <double> type.

Output:
The calculated interest, a floating-point number, is the output of the program, sc_out <double> variable.

Function:
This is a C++ program that calculates the compound interest of arbitrarily large amounts, where the interest rate and time periods are both expressed as non-integral quantities. The program is made better by using ANSI C++ and avoiding non-standard C++ library proprietary to only one implementation.

The first section defines the principal, rate, and time variables as double precision floating-point numbers. The second section, supplying data, calculates the compound interest using the equity calculator. The program then outputs the interest results in cout.

The provided C++/C code can be converted to SystemC code by writing a process whose behavior is the same as C++ program's. The equivalent SystemC code is as follows;

The CLass Adder takes two integer inputs a and b and a single integer output sum. In its constructor, the process add() is defined to calculate the sum of a and b and assign the result to sum. The sc_in<int> and sc_out<int> types are used for a and b inputs and outputs, respectively. Note that our SystemC code utilizes signals sc_in<double> principal and sc_in<double> rate so that it seamlessly integrates with the testbench.
