  This is an interesting assignment. This task requires comprehending the code provided and then writing its equivalent code in SystemC.

The C++/C code provided is part of a binary to decimal converter that takes an integer binary literal and outputs its equivalent decimal value.

The functions involved with this problem are
 
1. **binaryToDecimal** (In module const main): This function modifies the binary number to decimal by multiplying each digit by 2^i and adding it to the sum.
2. **main** (In module main): This function is the main function of the program that takes a binary number as input and passes it to the binaryToDecimal function. This function displays the output of the binaryToDecimal function.

From an integration perspective, SC_in and  SC_out  are the communication channels between two modules. SystemC allows users to define ports for these communications purposes. For this exercise, the binary_in and decimal_out signals should be selected.

The converted code is as follows in SystemC: 

```
#include<systemc.h>
sc_in<int> binary_in;  // Input signal for binary in
sc_out<int> decimal_out; // Output signal for decimal out 
 
// Driver code 
int main() 
 {
    // int num = 10101001;  // Input variable for binary number 
    cout<<binaryToDecimal(num)<<endl;  
}

// Function to convert binary to decimal 

int binaryToDecimal(int n) 
 {
    int num = n;
    int dec_value = 0;
    int base = 1;  // Base value of 2^0
    int temp = num;
    while(temp) {
        int last_digit = temp % 10;  // Last digit of number
        temp = temp / 10;         // Remove the last digit
        dec_value += last_digit * base;    // Add value
        base = base \* 2;           // Increase base value to 2^0 
    }

    return dec_value;   
}

```

This converted code exposes the desired functionality. SystemC offers a novel way to design hardware using software-based constructs, making design software developers more efficient and productive.
