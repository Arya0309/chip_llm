  This C++ program defines an object-oriented Complex class that represents a complex number with real and imaginary parts.
The Complex class includes the following:
* A constructor that accepts initial values for the real and imaginary parts.
* Two member variables, real and imaginary, to store the real and imaginary parts.
* A method addComp that adds two Complex objects.

In the Main method, two Complex objects are created.Their real and imaginary parts are printed, followed by the addition of the two complex numbers. The resulting sum is then printed.

According to the indented output, there are two inputs and one output. The input is a two-dimensional array or vector of integers with 250000 elements. The output is simply a one-dimensional array or a vector of integers with the same number of elements as the input.

The given C++ code can be translated into SystemC code, which is a hardware-level simulation environment. The SystemC code must intake and emit data using signals that in effect replace the standard C++ coding practice of printing to the console, allocating memory, or other low-level memory-management operations. - The top level Hardware.h And Hardware.cpp files.

Two classes are declared in the SystemC code:
* The input class InputClass that defines a complex number with real and imaginary parts.
* The output class OutputClass that defines a one-dimensional array of integers.

The add() method is a higher-level description that performs the addition of the ComplexClass objects and writes the output into the OutputClass instance.
In the main function, two complex number objects are created.
An input systemC signal named "real0" is connected to Complex0.real, and another input systemC signal named "imag0" is connected to Complex0.imaginary.

Similarly, two input signals are created named real1 and imag1, and connected to Complex1.real and Complex1.imaginary.

The add() method is called on Complex0 and Complex1. The output Connect to the real_sum and imaginary_sum systemC signals.
