  This code takes three integers from three separate controlees as input. The largest of these three values is determined, and a display of this value is provided.
To obtain the input signals, this code uses independent input signals for each of the three integers. 
the output is provided by the largest signal.


```
#include <systemc.h>
// Module that find the largest among three numbers
SC_MODULE(Largest)
// The a input signal is included.
// The b input signal is included.
// The c input signal is included.
// The largest output signal is included.

SC_CTOR(Largest)
// Used to input the a, b, and c input signals.
// used to output the largest output signal
sensitive
<< a 
<< b
<< c
end

#Method used to determine which is largest. which a, b, or c is the greatest. 
largest
.write(a.read() > b.read() && a.read() > c.read() ? a.read()) 
: (a.read() === b.read) 
: (b.read() > c.read() ? b.read() : c.read());
# Return the largest value
endtask
SC_END
```

Here is an example of how this code could be used on a board:
The C++/C code is used to determine the largest of three integers in a land-based computer (they are not all required to implement SystemC), based on the inputs received from a deck of cards (values 1-11 including the suit). The SystemC code simulates the explicit relationship between the three integers and the output.
## the output.
To do this, first generate the C code, which this SystemC code is meant to replicate. The output from the SystemC code will be the largest input value. This code will then be validated within a scattertestbench.
