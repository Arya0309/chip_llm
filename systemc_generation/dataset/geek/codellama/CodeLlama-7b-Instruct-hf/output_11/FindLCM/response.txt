  Inputs:

* a: an integer input that represents the first number
* b: an integer input that represents the second number
* max_num: an integer output that represents the LCM of the two input numbers

Outputs:

* lcm_result: an integer output that represents the LCM of the two input numbers

Explanation:

The C++ code provided presents a method to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two given integers using a loop that continues to increment a counter variable until it is found that the counter number is divisible by both the two input numbers.

* Line 1: The driver code int main() starts the logic flow.
* Line 2: The a and b input numbers are declared as 15 and 20, respectively.
* Line 3: The ternary representation of order operator allows comparison between the two numbers and assigns a greater number in a more graceful.
* Line 4: A while loop begins with a flag of 1.
* Line 5: the while loop begins iterating and checks whether the current value of max_nums can be divided by the two input values, a and b.
* Line 6: If it can not, the while loop increments and it continues to the next loop until it can.
* Line 7: Once the condition is true, the loop is exited, and the variable's max_num is printed out.

The above SystemC code describes the same logic and inputs as the above code.

Note that:

*  The SystemC code includes three input ports (a, b, and max_num).
* The line breaks for readability purpose only.
* Directly writing the code in comments can be considered disrespectful and confusing, especially if it is incomprehensible.
* Remember to add formatting, indentation, and comments to any answer for easy reading.
