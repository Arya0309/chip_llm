  Given the provided C++/C code, the input is a 2D array of integers "m[][4]" whose dimensions are determined by the variables "r" (number of rows) and "c" (number of columns). The output is the sorted 2D array "m[][4]".

The code first defines a nested loop to iterate over each row of the 2D array, followed by a nested loop to iterate over each column of the row.

Within each column, a further nested loop iterates over the elements of the column and compares adjacent elements. If the current element is greater than the next element, the two elements are swapped using the "swap" function.

Finally, the sorted array is printed to the console.

Based on this analysis, the equivalent SystemC code would be:
```c
#include <systemc.h>

// Module for sorting a 2D array of integers
SC_MODULE(Sort) {
    // Input ports for the 2D array and its dimensions
    sc_in<int> m[4][4];
    sc_in<int> r;
    sc_in<int> c;

    // Output port for the sorted 2D array
    sc_out<int> m_sorted[4][4];

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(Sort) {
        // Process for sorting the 2D array
        SC_METHOD(sort);
        sensitive << m << r << c;
    }

    // Method for sorting the 2D array
    void sort() {
        // Sort each row of the array
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            // Sort each column of the row
            for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                // Swap adjacent elements if necessary
                if (m[i][j] > m[i][j + 1]) {
                    swap(m[i][j], m[i][j + 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        // Update the sorted 2D array
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                m_sorted[i][j].write(m[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
};
```
This SystemC code utilizes the "sc_in" and "sc_out" port types to define the input and output ports of the module, and the "sc_method" construct to define the sorting process. The "sensitive" keyword is used to specify the sensitivity of the method to the input ports, in this case "m", "r", and "c". The method body first sorts each row of the input array, then updates the output port "m_sorted" with the sorted array.

Note that this is a high-level, synthesizable equivalent of the C++/C code, and will likely require some additional modifications to accurately capture all of the logic of the original code, such as handling corner cases and optimizing the sorting algorithm.
