  Inputs:

* `arr`: an array of integers of size `n`
* `n`: the size of `arr`

Outputs:

* `arr`: the sorted array

Overview of the code:

1. The `swap` function takes two pointers to integers, and swaps their values.
2. The `selectionSort` function takes an array of integers and its size `n` as inputs. It then iterates `n-1` times, each time finding the minimum element in the unsorted subarray and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted subarray.
3. The `printArray` function takes an array of integers and its size `n` as inputs and prints the array to the console.
4. The `main` function initializes an array of integers with values 64, 25, 12, 22, and 11, and passes the array and its size to the `selectionSort` function. It then prints the sorted array to the console.

Equivalent SystemC code:
```cpp
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that implements selection sort
SC_MODULE(SelectionSort) {
    sc_in<int> clk;
    sc_in<bool> start;
    sc_out<bool> done;
    sc_in<int> arr[10];
    sc_in<int> n;

    // Declare outputs
    sc_out<int> arr[10];
    sc_out<int> n;

    // Function to swap two integers
    void swap(int *xa, int *xb) {
        int temp = *xa;
        *xa = *xb;
        *xb = temp;
    }

    // Function to perform selection sort
    void selectionSort() {
        int i, j, min_idx;
        for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            // Find the minimum element in the unsorted subarray
            min_idx = i;
            for (j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) {
                    min_idx = j;
                }
            }
            // Swap the found minimum element with the first element
            swap(&arr[min_idx], &arr[i]);
        }
    }

    // Function to print the sorted array
    void printArray() {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sc_printf("%d ", arr[i]);
        }
        sc_printf("\n");
    }

    // Constructor
    SC_CTOR(SelectionSort) {
        clk = 0;
        start = 0;
        done = 0;
        arr = {};
        n = 0;
        selectionSort();
        printArray();
    }
};

```

The above code can be integrated with a testbench that provides the clock signal `clk` and starts the sort process when `start` is set to 1 (input). The sort can be terminated and the sorted array can be retrieved by setting `done` to 1 when the sort is complete.

The configuration of the sort is defined by the following SystemC module. The array `arr` is declared in the module to allow the sort to perform the sort in-place. The `n` variable is also declared in the module to allow the size of the array to be specified when the module is instantiated. The `swap` function is implemented as a method of the module to perform the swap operation on the array. The `selectionSort` function is also implemented as a method of the module to perform the selection sort. The `printArray` function is implemented as a separate method of the module to print the sorted array to the console.

Finally, the `SC_CTOR` body initializes the module with default values (0) for the clock signal, start signal, and done signal, and sets the sorted array and its size to empty arrays. The `selectionSort` method is called to perform the selection sort. The `printArray` method is then called to print the sorted array.
