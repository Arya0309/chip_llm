  Task 1: Analyze the provided C++/C code snippet

The provided code is a C++ program for multiplying two matrices. The code defines two matrices, `mat1` and `mat2`, with dimensions `R1` by `C1` and `R2` by `C2`, respectively. The code then defines a function `mulMat()` that multiplies the two matrices and outputs the result. The driver code calls the `mulMat()` function with two input matrices, `mat1` and `mat2`, and prints the resultant matrix to the console.

Task 2: Identify the inputs and outputs of the code

The inputs are two matrices `mat1` and `mat2` of dimensions `R1` by `C1` and `R2` by `C2`, respectively. The outputs are the resultant matrix of the multiplication of `mat1` and `mat2`.

Task 3: Provide a detailed, line-by-line or block-by-block natural language summary that explains each major line or block of code and its functionality.

The code declares two `int` arrays `mat1` and `mat2` to store the two input matrices. It also defines two `int` arrays `rslt` to store the result of the multiplication. The `mulMat()` function is declared with two input arguments `mat1[][C1]` and `mat2[][C2]`. The function then performs a nested loop to multiply the two matrices element-wise and sum the results. The result of multiplication is stored in the `rslt` array. Finally, the function prints the resultant matrix to the console.

The driver code also defines two `int` arrays `mat1` and `mat2` to store the two input matrices and calls the `mulMat()` function with these arrays. The driver code also prints the resultant matrix to the console.

Task 4: Based on your analysis, generate an equivalent SystemC code snippet that preserves the logic and can be used in a high-level synthesis flow.

SystemC code:

```
#include <systemc.h>

// Module that multiplies two matrices
SC_MODULE(MatrixMul) {
    sc_in<int> A[SIZE_A];          // Input port for matrix A
    sc_in<int> B[SIZE_B];          // Input port for matrix B
    sc_out<int> C[SIZE_RESULT];    // Output port for matrix C

    // Process to perform matrix multiplication
    SC_METHOD(matrix_mult);
    sensitive << A << B;

    // Method to multiply two matrices
    void matrix_mult() {
        for(int i = 0; i < R1; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < C2; j++) {
                C[i][j] = 0;
                for(int k = 0; k < R2; k++) {
                    C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

In the SystemC code, we define a module `MatrixMul` that has three input ports, `A`, `B`, and `C`, and a single output port, `C`. The `matrix_mult()` method performs the matrix multiplication by performing a nested loop across the input matrices. The result is stored in the output matrix `C`.

Note that the `A` and `B` inputs are of size `R1` by `C1` and `R2` by `C2`, respectively, while `C` is of size `R1` by `C2`. The resultant matrix `C` is of size `R1` by `C2`.
